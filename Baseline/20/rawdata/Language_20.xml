      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">'''Barallete''' is a largely vanished [[argot]] which used to be employed by the traditional knife-sharpeners and [[umbrella]]-repairers (''afiadores e paragüeiros'') of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]]  province of [[Ourense (province)|Ourense]], in [[Spain]].  

It was based on the [[Galician language]] as spoken in Ourense, but its users substituted everyday words with invented ones of no linguistic connection, making it impossible for other people to understand it.

An example of Barallete is:
 
:''Habia que chusar anque oretee ou axa barruxo, porque facía falta zurro, que Sanqueico nono da de balde.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050821234656/http://usuarios.lycos.es/vacariza/cobacost3.html]

:"We had to work even if it rained or even if there was mud, because money was needed, and God does not provide it free".

The same sentence in standard Galician:

:''Había que traballar aín[da ]que chova ou haxa barro, porque facía falta diñeiro, que Deus non o dá de balde.''

Barallete is said to have arisen in the twelfth century, and many words and phrases from this argot have been published in various recent works of fiction and non-fiction.[http://www.almargen.com.ar/sitio/seccion/musica/pato/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Cognitive synonymy''' is a type of [[synonym]]y in which synonyms are so similar in [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] that they cannot be differentiated either [[denotation|denotatively]] or [[connotation|connotatively]], that is, not even by [[association of ideas|mental associations]], [[connotation]]s, emotive responses, and [[poetry|poetic value]]. It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes. In [[usage]] employing this definition, synonyms with greater differences are often called near-synonyms rather than synonyms.&lt;ref name="Stanojević_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanojević |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193-200 |url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

'''Contrastive linguistics''' is a practice-oriented [[linguistics|linguistic]] approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages (hence it is occasionally called "''differential'' linguistics").

== History ==

While traditional linguistic studies had developed comparative methods ([[comparative linguistics]]), chiefly to demonstrate family relations between cognate languages, or to illustrate the historical developments of one or more languages, modern contrastive linguistics intends to show in what ways the two respective languages differ, in order to help in the solution of practical problems. (Sometimes the terms [[diachronic linguistics]] and [[synchronic linguistics]] are used to refer to these two perspectives.) 

Contrastive linguistics, since its inception by [[Robert Lado]] in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of [[applied linguistics]], e.g., to avoid [[Linguistic interference|interference]] errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Di Pietro, R.J. (1971) ''Language Structures in Contrast'', Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[contrastive analysis]]), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of [[translation|translating]] texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay &amp; Darbelnet (1958)&lt;ref&gt;Vinay, J.P. &amp; Darbelnet, J. (1958) ''Stylistique Comparée du Français et de l'Anglais'', Didier-Harrap.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Hatim (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, B. (1997) ''Communication across Cultures. Translation Theory and Contrastive Text Linguistics'', University of Exeter Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[translation]]), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Heltai, P. (1988) "Contrastive analysis of terminological systems and bilingual technical dictionaries", ''International Journal of Lexicography'' Vol. 1(1) pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hartmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1991) "Contrastive linguistics and bilingual lexicography", in ''Woerterbuecher/Dictionaries/Dictionnaires. International Encyclopedia of Lexicography'' ed. by F.J. Hausmann et al. (Vol. III, pp. 2854-2859), De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[bilingual lexicography]]). 

Contrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds ([[phonology]]), written symbols ([[orthography]]), word-formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), word meaning ([[lexicology]]), collocation ([[phraseology]]), sentence structure ([[syntax]]) and complete discourse ([[textology]]). Various techniques used in [[corpus linguistics]] have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1997) "From contrastive textology to parallel text corpora: Theory and applications", in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling. A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak'' ed. by R. Hickey &amp; S. Puppel. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastive linguistic studies can also be applied to the differential description of one or more varieties within a language, such as styles ([[contrastive rhetoric]]), dialects, registers or terminologies of technical genres.

'''Creolistics''', or '''Creology''', is the [[scientific]] study of [[creole language]]s and, as such, is a subfield of [[linguistics]]. Someone who engages in this study is called a '''creolist'''.

==Controversy==
Creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls "the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness."  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.

==="Creole", a sociohistoric concept===
''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as "the most creole of creoles."{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.

==="Creole", a genuine linguistic concept===
On the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.

To the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on "defining creole", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.

===Proposed synthesis===
The answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}

The answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.

Though the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Givón|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:

:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''
:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''
:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''
:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''

The authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into separate chapters outside this scheme whether or not relexification come into the picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37276">'''Heritage language learning''' or heritage language acquisition is the act of [[language acquisition|learning]] a '''[[heritage language]]''' from an [[ethnolinguistic group]] that traditionally speaks the language, or from those whose family historically spoke the language.  According to a commonly accepted definition by Valdés,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The teaching of heritage languages: an introduction for Slavic-teaching professionals. The learning and teaching of Slavic languages and cultures.|last=Valdés|first=G.|publisher=Olga Kagan and Benjamin Rifkin|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=375–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; heritage languages are generally minority languages in society and are typically learned at home during childhood.  When a heritage language learner grows up in an environment with a dominant language that is different from their heritage language, the learner appears to be more competent in the dominant language and often feels more comfortable speaking in that language.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  "Heritage language" may also be referred to as "community language," "home language," and "ancestral language".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Second Language Acquisition: perspectives and practices|last=Hummel|first=Kirsten|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different kinds of heritage language learners, such as learners with varying levels of proficiency in the heritage language, and also those who learn a "foreign" language in school with which they have some connection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leeman|first=Jennifer|year=2015|title=Heritage Language Education and Identity in the United States|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1662798729|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|volume=35|pages=100–119|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1017/s0267190514000245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polinsky &amp; Kagan&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polinsky | first1 = M. | last2 = Kagan | first2 = O. | year = 2007 | title = Heritage Languages: In the 'Wild' and in the Classroom | url = | journal = Language and Linguistics Compass | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 368–395 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2007.00022.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; label heritage language learners on a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to individuals who speak very little of their heritage language. Valdés&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valdés|first=Guadalupe|year=2005|title=Bilingualism, Heritage Language Learners, and SLA Research: Opportunities Lost or Seized?|url=|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=89.3|pages=410–26|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that a connection with a heritage language does not have to be made only through direct previous exposure to the language or a certain amount of proficiency in the language. In her conception of heritage language learners, monolingual English-speaking students of Armenian ancestry in the United States could consider themselves to have a heritage language of Armenian. A different definition of heritage language learners or speakers limits the term to individuals who were exposed to the language in early childhood, but who later lost proficiency in the language in favor of adopting the majority language of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montrul|first=Silvina|date=2010|title=Current Issues in Heritage Language Acquisition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|volume=30|pages=3–23|doi=10.1017/s0267190510000103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage language acquisition theories are highly contested. The most common theory is the Incomplete Acquisition Theory,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but other scholars have considered delayed acquisition, variations in input, and cross-linguistic influence as factors that contribute to heritage language speakers' competence (see section on Acquisition Theories). For children who may have acquired a different dialect of the heritage language, they would require a unique type of instruction that may differ from styles of instruction that would be most beneficial for students who experience incomplete acquisition at an early age.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Heritage languages can be learned in various contexts, including public school instruction and language courses organized by a community which speaks the particular language during after-school hours or on the weekend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When someone is engaged in informal heritage language learning, they are acquiring a language from a particular ethnolinguistic group that traditionally speaks the language, or from someone whose family historically spoke the language. Formal heritage language instruction occurs inside of a classroom, where learners are taught a language that is being used inside of the home or among members of their own ethnic group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Language programs that include Saturday schools and courses that happen outside of school hours are programs where children are encouraged to further develop and improve their heritage language proficiency.

According to Valdés,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the term "heritage language" can be used very broadly and can refer to minority languages which are spoken by what many know as "linguistic minorities." Typically, these heritage languages are endangered or have a high possibility of disappearing soon without intervention, and because of this, there are several communities in the United States that have chosen to work towards maintaining these languages.

== Heritage language vs native language ==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;The difference between native language (or [[First language]]) and heritage language is an important distinction to make. The term "native language" tends to be associated with acquisition at a very early age and carries with it the notion that a person will achieve a high amount of fluency and proficiency in this language. Typically, the native language is the dominant language for a speaker and this speaker is expected to have natural understanding of not only linguistic knowledge, but also pragmatic and cultural knowledge, as well as skills such as writing creatively, making jokes, and translating.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native Speaker in Applied Linguistics|last=Davies|first=Alan|publisher=The Handbook of Applied Linguistics|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=431–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term "heritage language" is more associated with the language in which proficiency was sacrificed in order to gain proficiency in the dominant language in a particular community. This is not always the case, however, as some speakers of heritage languages have just as much proficiency in that language as in their other language(s).

Heritage language learners differ from other types of language learners. Kagan &amp; Dillon&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kagan, O., &amp; Dillon, K. (2003). A new perspective on teaching Russian: Focus on the heritage learner. Heritage Language Journal, Available: {{cite web |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/languages/heritagelanguages/journal/article.asp?parentid=3693 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129211636/http://international.ucla.edu/languages/heritagelanguages/journal/article.asp?parentid=3693 |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; provide us with distinctions among speakers of Russian as a native language, and learners of Russian as a heritage language or a foreign language in the table below. The goal of the research was to distinguish between types of language learners of Russian and to use that information to create a new perspective for instruction. The table explains that students whose native language was Russian had acquired it as a child and used it throughout life with exposure to a full language community of speakers. For the students who learned Russian as a foreign language (L2), there was first an L1 or native language before they began learning Russian, the foreign language, which was typically learned solely outside of the community. Lastly, the heritage speakers of Russian had acquired Russian as an L1, but when they immigrated to the United States, English became their primary language. This left most heritage language students with varying levels of proficiency in their heritage language due to the limited community that spoke Russian.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Acquisition theories ==
Acquisition theories have been proposed in an attempt to explain why heritage speakers’  competence in the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Silvina Montrul’s research has been foundational to this work.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Her Incomplete Acquisition Theory states that heritage speakers do not completely acquire the heritage language before switching to the L2. As attrition can also render a grammar “incomplete,” attrition is included in this theory. Multiple researchers&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Domínguez | first1 = L | year = 2009 | title = Charting the route of bilingual development: contributions from heritage speakers' early acquisition | url = | journal = Int. J. Biling | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 271–287 | doi=10.1177/1367006909339812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; have refuted Silvina Montrul's proposal by suggesting that the Incomplete Acquisition Theory does not take into consideration delayed acquisition, input variation, and cross-linguistic influence, all of which factor into language competence.

As research on heritage language learners' acquisition is relatively recent, dating back to the early 2000s, there remains much to be discovered about the process. It should also be noted that the following acquisition theories pertain to language learners who have learned, at least partially, the heritage language before switching to the dominant language. For more information on heritage language learners who lack personal experience with the heritage language but have ancestry who spoke the language, see [[language revitalization]].

=== Incomplete Acquisition Theory ===

==== Incomplete Acquisition  ====
The Incomplete Acquisition Theory recognizes that complete acquisition of [[First language|L1]] takes place throughout childhood, stretching into the school-age period.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Montrul, S. (2010). Current Issues in Heritage Language Acquisition. ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''30.'' 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, heritage language learners, who typically switch to the dominant culture’s language when they enter school and, consequently, experience a decline in input in the heritage language, do not completely acquire their first language.&lt;ref&gt;Guijarro-Fuentes, P., Schmitz, K. (2015). The nature and nurter of heritage language acquisition. ''Lingua'', ''164'' (B), 239-250.&lt;/ref&gt; As heritage language learners are rarely schooled in their L1, they are often orally proficient but illiterate or have underdeveloped written comprehension and production in the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montrul | first1 = S. | last2 = Foote | first2 = R. | last3 = Perpiñán | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Gender Agreement in Adult Second Language Learners and Spanish Heritage Speakers: The Effects of Age and Context of Acquisition | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 503–553 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00449.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In treating heritage language learning as interrupted L1 acquisition, in which the learner has access to Universal Grammar, it is expected that heritage language learners have knowledge of concepts found in early stages of L1 development, such as binding constraints, wh-movement, and aspects of lexical semantics, and struggle with grammatical concepts that require sustained exposure and practice in school-aged children, such as specialized vocabulary and uses of the subjunctive in Spanish.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Moreira Flores, C.M. (2015). Understanding heritage language acquisition. Some contributions from the research on heritage speakers of European Portuguese. ''Lingua'', ''164.'' 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attrition ====
An incomplete grammar may be the result of attrition and fossilization of concepts in the L1 due to insufficient input once the child has switched to the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Montrul, S., Bowles, M., (2009). Back to basics: incomplete acquisition of Differential Object Marking in Spanish heritage speakers. Biling.: Lang. Cogn. 12 (3), 363--383.&lt;/ref&gt; Attrition is the loss of, or failure to make full use of, “grammatical knowledge previously acquired".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pires | first1 = A. | last2 = Rothman | first2 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Disentangling sources of incomplete acquisition: An explanation for competence divergence across heritage grammars | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 211–238 | doi=10.1177/1367006909339806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossilization occurs when a speaker lets go of non-core grammatical concepts but retains the basic core structure of the language.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Attrition and fossilization are considered to be part of the Incomplete Acquisition Theory because they render a language incomplete. However, Pires and Rothman (2009) argue that attrition should be distinguished from the Incomplete Acquisition Theory in future studies because, in instances of attrition, the speakers do, indeed, completely acquire the target grammar as children.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Alternative acquisition theories ===
==== Delayed Acquisition ====
Delayed acquisition may contribute to the difference in language competence between heritage speakers and monolingual speakers of the same language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Late or delayed acquisition of a language can have "consequences for linguistic, neurological, and cognitive mechanisms" that work to make language acquisition "fast, effortless, and... successful".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Flores and Barbosa (2014) studied the clitic placement of heritage speakers of Portuguese living in Germany and concluded that the heritage speakers went through the same stages of acquisition as their monolingual counterparts. However, the process of acquisition was delayed and took longer for the heritage speakers because they had reduced input of the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Flores, C. and Barbosa, P. (2014). ''When reduced input leads to delayed acquisition: A study on the acquisition of clitic placement by Portuguese heritage speakers.'' International Journal of Bilingualism, 18(3), 304-325. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this theory must be considered in conjunction with theories on input variation.

==== Input  ====
Theories of acquisition involving variations of input postulate that heritage language learners' production of the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers who speak the same language because the two groups are exposed to different dialects and quantities of input.

=====Dialect Variation=====

Theories surrounding dialect variation suggest that errors or deviations from the standard dialect made by a heritage language learner may reflect the acquisition of a non-standard variety or informal register of the heritage language, which include variations on certain properties or the lack of certain properties found in the standard dialect.  Heritage language learners are often only exposed to one dialect or colloquial variety of the heritage language, unlike their monolingual peers who interact with a standard monolingual dialect found in formal instruction.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, certain grammatical properties are only present in the standard dialect or are used infrequently in the colloquial dialect.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pires and Rothaman use the expression, "missing-input competence divergence," to refer to instances when a grammatical property is missing from the colloquial variety.

The dramatic difference between standard and colloquial dialects is particularly evident in cases of verbal morphology, the clitic system, the subjunctive, and inflected infinitives in Brazilian Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pires and Rothman (2009) found that Brazilian Portuguese heritage learners do not acquire inflected infinitives because their input does not "robustly instantiate these forms".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly, Dominguez (2009) found that deviations in the use and distribution of indicative and subjunctive forms that were in the output of heritage Spanish speakers were also found in the children's input (parental speech).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In certain cases, heritage language learners receive their input from first-generation migrants who have shown effects of attrition in certain domains. Consequently, the language learner would be missing grammatical properties in their input as a result of the interlocutor's attrition and would replicate these errors in their output.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Pires and Rothman (2009) claim that due to their "inborn faculty of language," children automatically acquire the grammar found in their input.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Therefore, in conclusion, it is not a deficient ability to acquire the language, but rather, the absence of, or limited access to, certain properties in the child's input that leads to errors in language production.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Without access to a standard dialect of the target language often found in formal academic contexts, heritage language learners continue to make these production errors.

=====Quantity of Input=====

Heritage language learners may also have a smaller quantity of input than their monolingual peers because the heritage language is only found in a restricted number of contexts and with fewer interlocutors. Citing statistics found in studies on hearing children with deaf parents, Flores and Barbosa (2014) posit that bilingual heritage language learners need a minimum of 5 to 10 hours of interaction per week with the language to develop native-like proficiency. Hours of input may be particularly restricted once the heritage speaker switches to the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

==== Cross-linguistic influence ====
Cross-linguistic influence may contribute to heritage speakers' competence divergence. Heritage language learners show a tendency to overuse grammatical properties that are found in both the heritage language and the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, heritage language learners may prefer grammatical structures from the dominant language and transfer them into the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To learn more about language transfer in bilingual individuals, see [[Crosslinguistic influence]].

== Identity and heritage language learning ==
There are many theories across disciplines that seek to explain the relationship between language and identity, but the existence of such a relationship is the common thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rozanov | first1 = T | year = 2016 | title = Language and identity explored | url = | journal = Journal of Arts and Humanities | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 1–8 | doi=10.18533/journal.v5i6.948}}&lt;/ref&gt; For heritage language learners, when their native or heritage language is not treated as valuable in the classroom, this negatively affects their view of themselves and their mental health.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Rabin | first2 = L. | last3 = Roman-Mendoza | first3 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Identity and Activism in Heritage Language Education | url = | journal = The Modern Language Journal | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 481–495 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many minority language speakers’ children lose the ability to speak the minority language once they enter the classroom, because of several detrimental factors discussed below. Heritage language learning may help these children regain or avoid losing the ability to communicate with their parents.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yilmaz | first1 = T | year = 2016 | title = The motivational factors of heritage language learning in immigrant bilingualism | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Science and Humanity | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 191–200 | doi=10.7763/ijssh.2016.v6.642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the ability to communicate with parents or other family members, it becomes difficult to create an identity intertwined with one's heritage culture. In fact, once the heritage language is lost, children may lose the cognitive ability to understand certain concepts or beliefs in their heritage culture. Those who lose the heritage language and choose not to actively maintain its use often assimilate into the dominant culture rather quickly.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When heritage language learning does take place, the “standard” language is instructed, and learners whose heritage language is of a different dialect are judged for their variance from the standard. This results in a loss of self-esteem that makes strong self-identity difficult.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

One group of heritage language learners includes international adoptees. Some parents that adopt internationally see heritage language learning as a necessary part of the adoptees connection with their own cultural identity, and choose to learn the heritage language along with their child. Though the language is not a heritage language for these parents, it is the language their child might have been brought up in and is a necessary part of “culture keeping,” or the act of purposefully ensuring the adopted child holds onto their birth culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Sarah|date=October 2012|title=Transforming culture and identity: transnational adoptive families and heritage language learning|doi=10.1080/07908318.2013.809095|journal=Language, Culture, and Curriculum|volume=26|issue=2|pages=161–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sub-category of heritage language learners are mixed-heritage learners. Studies show that these individuals may have a confused sense of identity because they do not feel that they are fully accepted by either culture.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = S. J. | year = 2010 | title = "What About Me? I'm Not Like Chinese But I'm Not Like American": Heritage-Language Learning and Identity of Mixed-Heritage Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 203–219 | doi=10.1080/15348458.2010.486277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage language learning can be a way to help mixed-heritage individuals connect to the culture of their minority language parent, but these children face several obstacles in pursuing this language, as described in “Detrimental Factors to Heritage Language Learning.”

For all heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown suggests that proficiency is positively correlated to both a strong perception of heritage and ethnic identity and a strong community in one's ethnic group.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Heritage Language Development : Focus on East Asian Immigrants. (2006). Amsterdam, NL: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research backs this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Y. G. (1992). ''The role of attitudes and motivation in learning a heritage language: A study of korean language maintenance in toronto.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chinen, K., &amp; Tucker, G. R. (2003). Saturday-school participation, ethnic identity and Japanese language development. Heritage Language Journal, 1(1).''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oketani, H. (1997a). Additive bilinguals: The case of post-war second-generation Japanese Canadian youths. Bilingual Research Journal, 21, 15– 35.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cho, G. (2000). The role of heritage language in social interactions and relationships: Reflections from a language minority group. Bilingual Research Journal, 24(4), 369– 384.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lee, J. S. (2002). The Korean language in America: The role of cultural identity in heritage language learning. Language, Culture, and Curriculum, 15 (2), 117– 133.''
&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Japanese heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown found that individuals with one parent speaking the language performed much better in both grammatical knowledge, and various self-assessment tools than those without a parent speaking Japanese. Individuals in this same study with either one Japanese speaking grandparent, or only being of Japanese descent performed on the same level, below those with one Japanese speaking parent. Kondo-Brown attributes this difference to variance in sense of ethnic identity.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== Contexts of heritage language learning ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=this whole article needs to be reorganized, really.|date=March 2018}}
===Overview : Before a learning program begins===

Heritage language learning is generally an effort to recover one's cultural identity, and is therefore linked to the language loss experienced by immigrant and indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Immigration and colonialism around the world have created communities of people who speak languages other than the dominant language at home.  Their minority status means that they must navigate the effects of linguistic difference, and the expression of culture, ethnicity, and values through language.  Heritage learners often cite a desire to connect with their cultural heritage as a major motivation for studying their heritage language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They may also be motivated by the global prominence and potential career advantages of some heritage languages.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Kagan, Olga (2012). ''Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education''. SAGE Publications, Inc. pp. 1048–1053. {{ISBN|9781412981521}} – via SAGE Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  As both major immigrant destinations and exporters of the world's dominant language, the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia are home to large populations of heritage language speakers.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Indigenous populations in Australia and the Americas also teach their own languages as heritage languages, attempting to revitalize them after the effects of colonial occupation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Immigration situation different in various countries, dialects===

The distribution of immigrant languages around the world largely reflects immigration patterns; for example, Spanish and Chinese are more likely to be taught as heritage languages abroad.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The language profile of a single immigrant community can also vary due to the presence of different dialects. This variation in dialects and even writing systems can be another obstacle in meeting community needs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ebb and flow in a country's immigrant populations can also lead to significant variation in the abilities of heritage learners in a single classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koshiba|first=Kenta|last2=Kurata|first2=Naomi|year=2012|title=Language Identities of Japanese Home-background Speakers and their Language Learning Needs|doi=10.1080/10371397.2012.730481|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=32|issue=3|pages=357–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted by the [[Language Resource Center|National Heritage Language Resource Center (UCLA)]] shows that in the United States, heritage speakers' interest in their home language tends to wane as they enter school, but may rise again in the later teenage years, prompting the decision to study it in college.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Various obstacles for education programs===

The study and teaching of indigenous heritage languages stands at odds with colonial governments' earlier attempts at forced cultural assimilation.  The process of language loss accelerated by colonial policies and practices means that many indigenous languages are faced with the threat of extinction, and the effort to teach them as heritage languages intersects with broader [[language revitalization]] projects.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Ball, Jessica (2009). [http://muse.jhu.edu/article/362174 "Supporting Young Indigenous People's Language Development in Canada: A Review of Research on Needs and Promising Practices"]. ''The Canadian Modern Language Review''. '''66''': 19–40 – via Project MUSE.&lt;/ref&gt; While learners of immigrant languages are likely to have at least partial knowledge of their language from an early age, indigenous language learners may never have spoken their languages before they began learning them in a formal setting.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Education in these languages is further complicated by social stigma, and the feelings of shame or inadequacy that some indigenous people may associate with their language due to colonial intervention.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Adult speakers coming from a legacy such as that of [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canada's residential schools]] (a project for assimilating indigenous peoples), whose negative psychological effects have been reported by [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], may be unable or unwilling to pass their language on to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Survivors_Speak_English_Web.pdf|title=The Survivors Speak: A Report of The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|last=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=February 22, 2017|via=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritage language pedagogy ==
Heritage language learners have widely varying circumstances and educational needs that set them apart from foreign language learners.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  They may have little to no understanding of the language, or be able to speak but not read or write it.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Formal education in heritage languages has existed since the nineteenth century, in immigrant communities and private and religious schools.  Heritage languages did not attract the attention of public education and universities until the concept of heritage language itself began to emerge as a separate field from [[Language education|foreign language learning]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Heritage languages are also referred to as community, ethnic, ancestral, minority, or non-official languages, but the term ''heritage language'' appears to have originated with Canadian programs of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Patricia A.|last2=Li|first2=Duanduan|date=2009-10-09|title=Indigenous, Minority, and Heritage Language Education in Canada: Policies, Contexts, and Issues|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/362176|journal=The Canadian Modern Language Review / La revue canadienne des langues vivantes|volume=66|issue=1|pages=1–8|issn=1710-1131|doi=10.3138/cmlr.66.1.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
When designing heritage language curricula and teaching methods, linguists and educators attempt to address the ways in which heritage learners are unique.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Heritage Language Focus Group (2003).  "[http://nhlrc.ucla.edu/nhlrc/page/curriculumguidelines/preface Curriculum Guidelines for Heritage Language Classrooms at the University of California.]"  Retrieved April 3, 2017 - via National Heritage Language Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the teaching of foreign languages, heritage language teaching methods place more emphasis on literacy and experiential, content-based approaches.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Because cultural identity is a definitive part of heritage language learning, languages are often taught alongside cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Teaching heritage languages is not limited to the classroom; it may be a part of other local community contexts, such as a volunteer work and internships, field trips, oral history projects, or [[Scouting|Scout troops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guardado|first=Martin|year=2009|title=Speaking Spanish Like a Boy Scout: Language Socialization, Resistance, and Reproduction in a Heritage Language Scout Troop|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/362171|journal=The Canadian Modern Language Review|volume=66|pages=102–129|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.3138/cmlr.66.1.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of California Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching.  "[http://uccllt.ucdavis.edu/white-papers/heritage-language-instruction.pdf University of California Guidelines on Heritage Language Instruction]."  Retrieved April 3, 2017 - via National Heritage Language Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritage and foreign language teaching ===
One question facing heritage language programs is the relationship of heritage language learners to foreign language learners of that same language.  The two types of students have different educational, cultural, and psychological backgrounds, which can lead to uneven learning outcomes if they are taught together.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Heritage language learners can be taught in entirely separate programs from foreign language learners, or in courses where different types of learners are integrated to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Dienst-Philipson, Samara (2009).  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/305183156 Comparison of Methods for Teaching Spanish as a Heritage Language in the Mainstream Classroom]".  via ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also be taught alongside their foreign language counterparts with no distinction between them, as is usually the case in college language courses.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Detrimental factors to heritage language learning ==
American immigrants often end their pursuit of heritage language learning after two or three generations in the United States, and it is now becoming more common to shift into English within two generations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The decision to end heritage language learning can stem from a variety of factors, but often includes societal pressure to use the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some L2 speakers view the dominant language as superior or associate it with higher class society, and prefer it to their heritage language, or believe it will lead them to greater opportunity than their native tongue.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some parents discourage use of the heritage language in the home because of a fear that their children will have a harder time learning the dominant language if they are also learning another language.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This belief is not supported by research. Research by Yan and Elena (as cited in Yilmaz 2016) showed better performance in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals in metalinguistic ability, pragmatics, and attention control.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This and other research actually points to [[Cognitive advantages of bilingualism]] including greater cognitive ability and mental flexibility.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Practical limitations to heritage language learning are also possible, and can include limited access to resources for heritage language learning, and limited materials in the heritage language. A combination of a social and practical limitation, classrooms may also discourage the use of minority languages by students during instruction.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In the sub-population of mixed-heritage learners, there may other stigmas that contribute to the loss of heritage language learning. If it is not widely accepted to marry outside of their culture, and individuals decide to do so anyhow, they may lose contact with their ethnic community upon marriage. This leaves them without access to a community of speakers in their heritage language. Their children now have little access to one parent’s native language, and little opportunity to pursue heritage language learning.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Although heritage language learning can be important in many cases, the stakes are particularly high when the language is near [[language extinction|extinction]]. In some cases, the active pursuit of heritage language learning is necessary to keep a minority languages alive, yet there may be limited learning materials and resources to do so. The language of the Cherokee people in North Carolina and in the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma fits into this category. In these situations, it is also likely that there is limited access to social communities of native speakers to communicate with. Without this natural input as well as pedagogical input, speakers may not achieve the fluency needed to keep the language alive, and the minority language may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = L. | last2 = Hirata-Edds | first2 = T. | year = 2009 | title = Learning to read and write cherokee: Toward a theory of literacy revitalization | url = | journal = Bilingual Research Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 207–227 | doi=10.1080/15235880903170041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idea networking''' is a qualitative method of doing a [[cluster analysis]] of any collection of statements, developed by Mike Metcalfe at the [[University of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=2014 |chapter=Idea networking |title=How concepts solve management problems |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |pages=62–74 |isbn=9781783471072 |oclc=868380268 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories. The statements might be source from interviews, text, web sites, [[focus group]]s, [[SWOT analysis]] or community consultation. Idea networking is [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements. Rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked (paired). These links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters. When named, these clusters provide emergent categories, meta themes, frames or concepts which represent, structure or sense-make the collection of statements.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

==Method==
An idea network can be constructed in the following way:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;
* 60 to 200 statements are listed and assigned reference numbers. 
* A table is constructed showing which statements (by reference number) are linked (paired) and why. For example, statement 1 maybe linked to statements 4, 23, 45, 67, 89 and 107 because they all are about the weather (see table). 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Statement !! Is Linked To !! Because They Are About
|-
| 1 || 4, 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Weather
|-
| 2 || 16, 29, 46, 81 || Light
|-
| 3 || 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Interaction
|-
| 4 || 13, 16, 34, 78, 81 || Weather
|-
| Etc. || Etc. || Etc.
|}

The number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7; many more will result in a congested network diagram. This means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak, or by sub sets. For example, statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather, wet weather or bad weather, etc.). This linking is sometimes called 'coding' in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons (source, context, time, etc.). There maybe many tens of reasons why statements are linked. The same statements may be linked for different reasons. The number of reasons should not be restricted to low number as so anticipate the resultant clustering. 
*The reference numbers are inputed to a network diagramming software, usually in the form of a matrix with the reference numbers along the top and side of the matrix. Each cell will then have a 1 or 0 to indicate whether its row and column reference number are linked. 
*The software is instructed to draw network diagram using maximum node repulsion. This encourages cluster formation.  Around 5 clusters are identified in the network diagram, both visually and using the cluster identification algorithms supplied with the software (e.g. Newnan Girvan sub-groups) 
[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Network]]
*A descriptive collective adjective name is determined for each cluster of statements (a meta narrative, classification name or label). 
*The list of statements is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your analysis of the statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, safety, light and inspiration in their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=Problem conceptualisation using idea networks |journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=141–150 |doi=10.1007/s11213-006-9056-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying philosophy ==
In his book ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'', the pragmatist [[Christopher Alexander]] suggested networking the ideas of clients as means to identifying the major facets of an architectural design.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; This is still used modern design work usually using [[cluster analysis]]. Modern [[social network analysis software]] provides a useful tool for how these ideas can be networked. 
This simply adds ideas to the list of computers, power stations, people and events that can be networked (see [[Network theory]]).&lt;ref name="socialcapitalnetknowtransfer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inkpen |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Tsang |first2=Eric W. K. |date=January 2005 |title=Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer |journal=[[Academy of Management Review]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=146–165 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.15281445 |jstor=20159100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between ideas can be represented in a matrix or network. Modern network diagramming software, with node repulsion algorithms, allows useful visual representation of these networks revealing clusters of nodes.

When networking peoples' statements or ideas, these become the nodes and the links are provided by an analyst linking those statements thought to be similar. Keywords, synonyms, experience or context might be used to provide this linking. For example, the statements: (1) "That war is economics progressed by other means, might be considered linked to the statement"; (2) "That progress unfortunately needs the innovation which is a consequence of human conflict". 
 
Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues we use our conceptions to interpret our perceptions (sensory inputs).&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|18}} These conceptions might be represented by words as conceptual ideas or concepts. For example, if we use the conceptual idea or concepts of justice to interpret the actions of people, we get a different interpretation (or meaning) compared to using the conceptual idea of personal power. Using the conceptual idea of justice makes certain action ideas seem reasonable. These may include due process, legal representation, hearing both sides, have norms or regulations for comparison. Therefore, there is a relationship between conceptual ideas and related apparently rational action ideas.

If the statements gathered at a consultative meeting are considered action ideas, then clusters of these similar actions ideas might be considered to examples of a meta idea or conceptual idea. These are also called themes, and frames. Modern research extending Miller's Magic number 7 plus or minus 2, to idea handling, suggests a five-part classification is appropriate for humans.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

==Notable applications and uses==

Using networking to cluster statements is considered useful because:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

*It provides a multi-dimensional alternative to [[post-it note]]s in clusters.
*It offers a convenient graphic which can be presented in reports and analysed using network metrics (See [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software]]). 
*It is an auditable process where each step taken can be explained in supporting documentation.
*It is a qualitative alternative, and thus more subtle and transparent, than [[NVivo]], [[thematic analysis]], [[cluster analysis]], [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] or [[principal component analysis]]. This subtleness includes enabling the analyst to deal with metaphor, synonyms, pronouns and alternative terminology generally. No variables (variation in numerical data) are necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1600">The  '''[[Indo-Portuguese]] Creole of [[Bombay]]''' was a [[creole language|creole]] language based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which grew out of the long contact between the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and local languages. Currently this language is extinct. It was spoken in [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]) and northern [[India]]: [[Pathein|Bassein]], [[Salsette]], [[Thane|Thana]], [[Chevai]], [[Mahim]], [[Tecelaria]], [[Dadar]], [[Parel]], [[Cavel]], [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]]-[[Badra, India|Badra]], Govai, Marol, [[Andheri]], [[Versova, Mumbai|Versova]], [[Malvan]], [[Manori]], [[Mazagaon]]. This language was, after the [[Ceylon]] creole dialect of Indo-Portuguese, the most important. In 1906 there were still close to 5,000 people who spoke [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] Creole as their mother tongue, 2,000 in [[Mumbai]] and [[Mahim]], 1000 in [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]], 500 in [[Thane|Thana]], 100 in Curla (now [[Kurla]]), 50 in [[Pathein|Bassein]] and 1,000 in other towns. There were, at that time, schools that taught Creole and the richest classes, which were replaced by the [[English language|English]] language.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite class="citation web"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729041842/http://www.colonialvoyage.com/pt/asia/lingua/heranca.html «A Herança da Língua Portuguesa no Oriente (Ásia)»]&lt;span class="reference-accessdate"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of the Peoples of the North''' ({{lang-ru|Институт Народов Севера}}) is a research and later educationary institute based in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Its objective is to examine topics related to the northern minorities in the [[Soviet Union]], and to prepare teachers for the northern boarding schools. One of the central figures involved in the research institute was [[Vladimir Bogoraz]].

The institute was founded in 1930, as four years previously it had become possible to study the languages of the northern peoples in their own right at the Institute for Eastern Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. By the end of 1929, the institute's teachers had joined forces to create the Unified Northern Alphabet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization |last= Grenoble |first= Lenore A. |authorlink= |author2=Lindsay J. Whaley |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-81621-1|pages=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Единый северный алфавит}}) for use by the linguistic minorities living in the north of the Soviet Union. The alphabet consisted of 32 Latin-based letters, some of which were equipped with [[diacritic]]s. For practical reasons, i.e., typographical reasons, a move to rid the alphabet of graphemes using diacritics was made and one year later a new version was ready. On December 13, 1930, the [[Presidium]] of the Scientific Investigation Association at the institute presented a version of the Unified Northern Alphabet to the Scientific Council of the USSR’s Central Committee on Alphabet Adaptation ({{lang-ru|Всесоюзного центрального комитета нового алфавита}}). The same body discussed the draft again on December 18 and it was approved on February 23, 1931. The scientific section of [[Narkompros]] approved the draft in May the same year. 

The alphabet consisted of 39 letters: 29 consonants and 10 vowels. In addition, some letters were marked with diacritics to show [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], [[Length (phonetics)|length]] and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

An intensive and systematic publishing campaign was launched immediately after the alphabet had been formally approved. From 1939 to 1949, approximately 300 experts were employed by the institute.

''The finalisation of principles for creation of a literary public institution for the peoples of the north'' came at the first pan-Russian conference. Delegates to the conference (which was held at the INS ni Leningrad) were representatives for Narkompros, Komitet Severa v/Presidium VCIK, CK Novogo Alfavita SSSR i RSFSR, and the publisher Učpedgiz. In the work conducted at the conference, there were participants from the national northern okrugs, for the local Northern Committees, for CK VLKSM, for the soviet Academy of Sciences, for the Historical-linguistic institute in Leningrad, and for the Northern department at the [[Herzen University|Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute]]. The preparation work was done at INS.

The conference decided to create orthographies for a total of 16 languages and to have books available for the 15th anniversary of the revolution:

* the [[Uralic languages]]: ''[[Nenets languages|Nenets]], [[Selkup language|Selkup]], [[Khanty language|Khanty]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Kildin Sami]]''
* the [[Tungusic languages]]: ''[[Evenki language|Evenki]], [[Even language|Even]], [[Nanai language|Nanai]] and [[Udege language|Udege]]''
* the [[Paleosiberian languages]]: ''[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], [[Koryak language|Koryak]], [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]], [[Siberian Yupik]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] and [[Ket language|Ket]]''

Various books, including primers and math textbooks, were published using this alphabet. The first work published using the new orthography was a book on terminology specific to these areas.

==After World War II==

The institute was run in its original form from 1930 until 1941. Between 1942 and 1945, the institute was located in [[Omsk]], after which it moved back to Leningrad as a part of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. Since 1948, the institute has been a part of the [[Herzen University]], to which it still belongs today.

'''Language delay''' is a failure in [[children]] to develop [[language]] abilities on the usual [[age-appropriate]] for their [[developmental timetable]]. Language delay is distinct from [[speech delay]], in which the development of the [[Manner of articulation|mechanical and motor aspects of speech production]] is delayed.

Communication is a two-stage process.  The first stage is to encode the message into a set of words (or signs in the case of Sign Languages) and sentence structures that convey the required meaning, i.e. into language. In the second stage, language is translated into motor commands that control the articulators (hands, face, body, lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc.), thereby creating language.

Because language and speech are independent, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech
(i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language because they use a Sign Language or other means of communication.

{{anchor|receptive|expressive}}Language delay is commonly divided into ''receptive'' and ''expressive'' categories. [[Receptive language]] refers to the process of understanding language.  [[Expressive language]] refers to the use of sentences (made of words or signs) to communicate messages to others.  Both categories are essential to effective communication.

==Effects==
Language delay is a [[risk factor]] for other types of developmental delay, including social, emotional, and cognitive delay.  Some children may grow out of these deficits, even coming to excel where they once lagged, while others do not. One particularly common result of language delay is delayed or inadequate acquisition of [[reading (activity)|reading]] skills. Reading depends upon an ability to code and decode script (i.e., match speech sounds with symbols, and vice versa). If a child is still struggling to master language and speech, it is very difficult to learn another level of complexity (writing). Thus, it is crucial that children have facility with language to be successful readers.

Neuroscientist [[Steven Pinker]] postulates that a certain form of language delay may be associated with exceptional and innate analytical prowess in some individuals, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Steven| last=Pinker| title=His Brain Measured Up| url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=24 June 1999| accessdate=2006-12-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| archivedate=11 December 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Language delays are the most frequent [[developmental delay]]s, and can occur for many reasons. A delay can be due to being a “[[late bloomer]]”, “[[late talker]]”, or a more serious problem. The most common causes of speech delay include
* Hearing loss
* Slow development
* [[Intellectual disability]]

Such delays can occur in conjunction with a lack of mirroring of [[facial response]]s, unresponsiveness or unawareness of certain [[noise]]s, a lack of interest in playing with other children or toys, or no pain response to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |title=Language Learning Styles |date=August 2013 |publisher=TLG |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823095038/http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |archivedate=23 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Autism_Resource_Center/FAQ.aspx| publisher=American Academy of Children &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry| accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes include:
* [[Psychosocial deprivation]] - The child doesn't spend enough time talking with adults. Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Committee on Public Education |title=Media education |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=341–3 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10429023 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/2/341.long |doi=10.1542/peds.104.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Television]] viewing is associated with delayed language development. Children who watched television alone were 8.47 times more likely to have language delay when compared to children who interacted with their caregivers during television viewing.&lt;ref name="Chonchaiya 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chonchaiya| first1=W| last2=Pruksananonda| first2=C |title=Television viewing associates with delayed language development |journal=[[Acta Paediatrica]] |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=977–82 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18460044 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00831.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], children under the age of 2 should watch no television at all, and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged. Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance.
* Stress during pregnancy is associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid17355398"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talge| first1=NM| last2=Neal| first2=C| last3=Glover| first3=V |title=Antenatal maternal stress and long-term effects on child neurodevelopment: how and why? |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=48 |issue=3-4 |pages=245–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17355398 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01714.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being a twin increases the chance of speech and language delays. Reasons for this are thought to include less one-on-one time with parents, premature birth, and the companionship of their twin sibling reducing their motivation to talk to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twinpickle.com/2017/11/07/do-twins-talk-to-each-other/|title=Do Twins Talk to Each Other in a Secret Language?|date=2017-11-07|work=Twin Pickle|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]{{fact|date=December 2016}}
* [[Autism]] (a developmental disorder) - There is strong evidence that autism is commonly associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid16608544"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miniscalco| first1=C| last2=Nygren| first2=G| last3=Hagberg| first3=B| last4=Kadesjö| first4=B| last5=Gillberg| first5=C |title=Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at age 6 and 7 years who screened positive for language problems at 30 months |journal=[[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |date=May 2006 |doi=10.1017/S0012162206000788| pmid=16608544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19713073"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagberg BS, Miniscalco C, Gillberg C |title=Clinic attenders with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: cognitive profile at school age and its relationship to preschool indicators of language delay |journal=[[Research in Developmental Disabilities]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19713073 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asperger syndrome]], which is on the autistic spectrum, however, is not associated with language delay.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selective mutism]] (the child just doesn't want to talk)
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (a movement disorder caused by brain damage)
* Genetic abnormalities - In 2005, researchers found a connection between expressive language delay and a genetic abnormality: a duplicate set of the same genes that are missing in sufferers of [[Williams-Beuren syndrome]]. Also so called [[XYY syndrome]] can often cause speech delay.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/47xyy-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;
* Correlation with male sex, previous family history, and maternal education has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell| first1=T F| last2=Dollaghan| first2=C A| last3=Rockette| first3=H E| last4=Paradise| first4=J L| last5=Feldman| first5=H M| last6=Shriberg| first6=L D| last7=Sabo| first7=D L| last8=Kurs-Lasky| first8=M| title=Risk factors for speech delay of unknown origin in 3-year-old children| journal=[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]| date=2002| volume=74| issue=2| pages=346–57| pmid=12705559| url=http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/phonology/pubs/PUB18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Studies have failed to find clear evidence that language delay can be prevented by training or educating health care professionals in the subject. Overall, some of the reviews show positive results regarding interventions in language delay, but are not curative.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary - Early Identification of Language Delays, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DictionaryFrenchAcademy1835.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Académie française]] in [[France]] is charged with maintaining the purity of the [[French language]].  This is the first page of the 6th edition of their [[dictionary]] (1835)]]

'''Linguistic purism''' or '''linguistic protectionism''' is the practice of defining or recognizing one [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] as being purer or of intrinsically higher quality than other varieties. Linguistic purism was institutionalized through [[Language academy|language academies]] (of which the 1572 [[Accademia della Crusca]] set a model example in Europe), and their decisions often have the force of law.&lt;ref name="Thomas1991p108"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Thomas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G18NAQAAMAAJ |title=Linguistic purism|publisher=University of Michigan|year=2010|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived or actual decline identified by the purists may take the form of change of vocabulary, [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] of [[grammatical]] elements, or [[loanword]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Linguistic purism is a form of [[linguistic prescriptivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrejs Veisbergs|title=Linguistic Studies in Latvia | publisher=University of Latvia|issue=1|volume=18|year=2010|pages=15|chapter=Development of the Latvian Language, Purism and Prescriptivism|url=https://www.lu.lv/fileadmin/user_upload/lu_portal/apgads/PDF/Humanities_18-1-SprSum2010_Gala-Drukai.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janicki2006p155"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWAz__vpe88C&amp;pg=PA155|title=Language Misconceived: Arguing for Applied Cognitive Sociolinguistics|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2006|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unwanted similarity is often with a neighboring language whose speakers are culturally or politically dominant.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The abstract ideal may invoke logic, clarity, or the grammar of "classic" languages. It is often presented as conservative, as a "protection" of a language from the "aggression" of other languages or of "conservation" of the [[nationalism|national]] [[Volksgeist]], but is often innovative in defining a new standard. It is sometimes part of governmental [[language policy]] which is enforced in various ways.

==Cognate languages==
{{Main|Abstand and ausbau languages}}
In one common case, two closely related languages or language varieties are in direct competition, one weaker, the other stronger.  Speakers of the stronger language may characterize the weaker language as a "[[dialect]]" of the strong language, with the implication that it has no independent existence.  In response, defenders of the other language will go to great lengths to prove that their language is equally autonomous.

In this context, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] have in the past sometimes been considered dialects of [[German language|German]]. In the case of [[Low German]], spoken in eastern Netherlands and northern [[Germany]], the debate is still current, as it could be considered a dialect of Dutch or German or a language of its own. An example of a related language that has only recently attained the status of an official national language is [[Luxembourgish]]. Since linguistic science offers no scholarly definition of a dialect, and linguists regard the distinction with scepticism – see [[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]] – the argument is really about subjective questions of [[identity politics]], and at times it can invoke extreme emotions from the participants.

===Writing systems===
Closely related languages often tend to mix. One way of preventing this is using different writing systems or different [[orthography|spelling systems]].

Examples of this include:
* The [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages are virtually identical in all respects except that Moldovan used the [[Cyrillic script]] – which is still in use in [[Transnistria]] – and Romanian uses the [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]].
* [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]], traditionally kept separated by using the [[Devanagari]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], respectively. This is a well-known example often cited in linguistic texts; however, in recent decades, it has been observed that the languages are tending to drift much further apart, due to the Sanskritization of Hindi and the [[Arabization]] and [[Persianization]] of Urdu.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} 
* The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] languages differ mainly in using the [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]] and Latin scripts, respectively. Both of them exhibit a high degree of mutual intelligibility as both standard Serbian and Croatian are based on essentially the same dialect (a stylized form of [[Štokavian|Neoštokavian]]).

==Forms==
Various scholars have devised classifications of purism. These classifications take different criteria as their starting point and are therefore partly independent of each other.
===Based on the approach===
* '''Archaizing purism''': This occurs when a speech community tries to resuscitate the language of a perceived or actual golden age of literature.  Examples: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Tanittamil Iyakkam]] in [[Tamil language]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (see also: [[Linguistic purism in Icelandic]]), [[Ancient Greek]] ([[Atticism]]), [[Katharevousa]] in [[Modern Greek]], [[Sanskrit revival|Sanskrit]], [[Latin]] (puristic obsession with classical forms during the [[Renaissance]]). See also [[Language revival]].
* '''Ethnographic purism''': This form is based on an idealization of the countryside, folk stories and dialects.  Examples: [[Nynorsk]] (New Norwegian), some versions of [[Demotic Greek]].
* '''Elitist purism''': Associated with a highly formal variety linked to an [[elite]], for example the language spoken at the court.
* '''Reformist purism''': The main feature here is to break the bonds with the past.  An example of this is the removal of [[Persian language|Persian]] and Arabic words during [[Turkish language#Language reform and modern Turkish|Turkish language reform]] under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in order to break with the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] influenced by Arabic and Persian. Other examples are the purist efforts in languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Hindi]] to break with the colonial past. In addition, [[Language policy|language policies]] may seek to decrease similarities between mutually intelligible languages for [[Identity politics|ethno-political reasons]], as has been the case with [[Dano-Norwegian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].
* '''Patriotic purism''': involves the elimination or exclusion of foreign elements. Examples include [[Høgnorsk|High Norwegian]], [[Linguistic purism in the Korean language|Korean]] and [[Linguistic purism in English|Anglish]]. Many [[English language|English]] writers of the 19th and 20th centuries extolled the virtues of "strong" [[Anglo-Saxon]] words such as ''foreword'', which was coined to replace the "weak" Romance word ''preface''.  [[French Language|French]], [[German language|Germans]], [[Greek language|Greeks]] and [[Latvian language|Latvians]] are known for their preference for [[Word coinage|coining]] words over borrowing foreign words (but this does not always work well, since many French words or expressions coined to avoid the use of a loanword (especially an English one) have not been adopted in common language, or are used only marginally).

This classification of puristic orientations made by George Thomas represents ideal forms. In practice, though, these orientations are often combined.

===Based on the goals===
* '''Democratic purism''': Aims at safeguarding the intelligibility of (modern) concepts for a larger group of language users through enforcing their expression by the means of common, every-day words or expressions (for example, "back[ing] up" instead of "sustain[ment]")
* '''Unificatory purism''': Aims at better uniting the overall user group of a language by reducing certain regional or professional linguistic peculiarities which could separate varying aspects of life, or even obstruct interconnectivity, between individuals or sub-groups of different regional provenience or professional background.
* '''Defensive purism''': Aims at defending a language from external threats.  Mostly, these are to be understood as influx of foreign ideas which a given language group (or its political system) disdains or has overthrown, or influx of foreign words or expressions which tend to substitute innate vocabulary, thus diminishing and/or endangering supra-regional or inter-generational intelligibility within a language area or between its present speakers and the literary remnants of their venerated ancestors, i. e., some kind of "classical" heritage (as e. g. Shakespeare's usage is already no more widely understood amongst many of today's English speakers {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} {{Dubious|date=June 2017}}).
* '''Prestige purism''': Aims at varying prestige functions.
* '''Delimiting purism''': Aims at establishing some kind of separating functions.

===Based on the intensity===
* '''Marginal purism''': In this pattern purism never becomes at any stage a value-feature of the speech community.  On the contrary, there is a certain openness to all sources of enrichment, at the same time characterized by a lack among the language elite of intellectual digestion of foreign influxes, or by a lack of such an elite as a whole.  Examples:  [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Ancient Greek]].
* '''Moderate, discontinuous purism''': In this pattern, a moderate attitude is discernible over a long period of time.  Examples:  [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].
* '''Trimming purism''':  A reactive correction to a potentially dangerous trend in the development of a standard language.  Examples:  [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]].
* '''Evolutionary purism''': In this pattern purism is seen early in the development of a written language.  There are no radical changes or orientation. During the standardisation process, the purism gains momentum after which it slows down. Examples: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]].
* '''Oscillatory purism''': Involves repeated swings between intense purism and a more inclusive attitude.  Examples: [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Yiddish]].
* '''Stable, consistent purism''': In this pattern no interruption or fluctuation in intensity is seen.  Purism is a constant value-feature of the speech community.  Examples:  [[Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].
* '''Revolutionary purism''': An abrupt and violent change from the previously mentioned patterns to another.  Examples: [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

===Based on linguistic level===
* '''Lexical purism''': directed at the lexicon, first of all against direct lexical loans, often combined with the development of loan translations (such as in Norwegian: ''hand out'' &gt; ''støtteark'' and ''snowboard'' &gt; ''snøbrett'' or [[Arabic]] ''tilifūn'' &gt; ''hātif'' and ''kumbyūtir'' &gt; ''ḥāsūb''.
* '''Orthographic purism''': directed against foreign orthographic elements (such as in Norwegian: ''genre'' &gt; ''sjanger'', in Spanish: ''football'' &gt; ''fútbol''). Note that there is also reverse orthographic purism. Some Spanish speakers prefer the English spelling "blue jean"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-475160 |title=CĂ"MO CREE QUE SE ESCRIBE: BLUE JEAN O BLUYĂ?N – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |publisher=eltiempo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and object to the spelling ''bluyín''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rae.es/bluyín |title=bluyín |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129200915/http://rae.es/bluy%C3%ADn |archivedate=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Morphological purism''': directed against foreign inflection and declension (such as the resistance to plural -s in noun endings in Scandinavian languages). 
* '''Syntactic purism''': directed at syntactic features from other languages (such as the stylistic resistance in Nynorsk against some passive constructions and some constructions with the genitive). 
* '''Phonetic purism''': directed at foreign phonemes and phonematical combinations (such as ''gánster''&lt;ref&gt;[http://rae.es/gánster] {{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''champú''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522113929/http://buscon.rae.es:80/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=Champ%C3%BA|url=http://buscon.rae.es:80/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=Champ%C3%BA|title=champú|archivedate=22 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Spanish). Note that there is a reverse phonetic purism, which insists in the original pronunciation, such as pronouncing ''gá'''ng'''ster'' and '''''sh'''ampú'' in Spanish.

===Other forms===
* '''Regressive purism''':  The eradication of very old loan-words.  It is one of the main features of ultrapurism.
* '''{{visible anchor|Ultrapurism}}''': The extreme upper limit of purism.  In this pattern, everything expressed by human speech can become a target for puristic intervention, even geographical names, proper names, and names of physical elements, chemicals, etc. (It should be noted, however, that the attitude – in itself "puristic" and associated with increased education and foreign language competency – opposed to the translation or adaptation of toponyms, or even personal names, is historically quite recent, as names are not considered fixed or unchanging in most cultures; and there are many exceptions even in English, especially the names of historical personages, Native Americans, and even contemporary royalty. Historically, names were part of the lexicon of a language just as every other word, and it was common to have different names associated with different language communities. See [[exonym and endonym]]. Also, the names of physical elements and chemicals, or astronomical objects, do vary between languages, sometimes quite radically. The longer established the tradition of a name or term, the more likely are strong differences.) The only two recorded examples of this are [[High Icelandic]] (Háfrónska), and the usage of the German renaissance humanist [[Johannes Aventinus|Johann Georg ''Turmair'']] who even translated the name of the ancient Roman general [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Cunctator]] into ''Zauderer Bohnenmaier'' (i. e. literally "Laggard Bean-Mayor"). While not ultra-purism per se, [[phono-semantic matching]] is commonly used in a number of languages, notably for translating proper names into Chinese.

The '''Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program''' is a program to help younger community members learn their language of heritage with fluent elders in the community, typically in the form of a summer program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The program was developed by Leanne Hinton, working with the Native California Network and its subsidiary committee, the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival. The program was developed in collaboration with the speakers of six indigenous California languages: Karuk, Hupa, Yurok, Wintu, Yowlumne, and Mojave.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1997-01-01|title=Survival of Endangered Languages: The California Master-Apprentice Program|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/ijsl.1997.123.177|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|doi=10.1515/ijsl.1997.123.177|issn=1613-3668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MALLP ran for the first time in the summer of 1993, and has grown each year since its inception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1996, only three years after it began, the program funded 26 teams, covering the original six languages, as well as Patwin, Paiute, and Kiliwa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since its creation, the program has been adopted by several other endangered indigenous language groups, including Aboriginal groups in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knut|first=Olawsky,|date=2013-04-12|title=The Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program Down Under: Experience and Adaptation in an Australian Context|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4569|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnld.org/MALLP|title=Master-Apprentice training {{!}} www.rnld.org|website=www.rnld.org|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Columbia, Canada, where it is now referred to as the Mentor-Apprentice Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpcc.ca/language/Programs/Master-Apprentice.aspx|title=First Peoples' Cultural Council  {{!}} Mentor-Apprentice Program|website=www.fpcc.ca|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=firstpeoplescouncil|title=Master-Apprentice Program pt.1|date=2010-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kUhfYAwZes|accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onowa McIvor and Peter Jacobs from the University of Victoria, in particular, conducted a study of Mentor-Apprentice learners in BC and determined that this program is particularly effective for teaching adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uvic.ca/news/topics/2016+indigenous-language-revitalization-adult-learners-study+ring|title=MAPs for Indigenous language learning - University of Victoria|website=UVic.ca|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indiginous-languages-bc-1.3828536|title=Adults shamed for speaking Indigenous languages hold key to revival|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The program was designed to be easily utilized by groups without extensive linguistic training, allowing communities to use the program on their own. It was also designed to align with the traditional learning style of California indigenous groups, which favours a one-on-one, voluntary learning environment, as opposed to the Western model of education that emphasizes competition among students and negative consequences for poor performance (i.e. poor grades).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The need for a program like the MALLP was evident due to the resource- and people-heavy nature of school-based language revitalization programs, like those used among the Maori, Irish, Hawaiians, and Welsh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, most of the parental generation of indigenous California communities no longer spoke their ancestral language, eliminating the possibility of revitalization through use of the language in the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of these issues, the MALLP was developed with the aim of assisting young professionals in these communities, and current and future parents, to become proficient speakers of their language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The Program==

The main goal of the MALLP is that the apprentice attains proficiency in their language over a few years, through the creation of mini-immersion settings within each team.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To create the mini-immersion settings, the teams are encouraged to go about their daily lives as normal, for a minimum number of hours per week, but to always communicate in the language that is being learned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program incorporates techniques from several language-learning programs, including Total Physical Response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14761708|title=Learning another language through actions : the complete teacher's guidebook|last=1929-|first=Asher, James J.

# Teams should strive to communicate only in their language, and avoid English as much as possible.
# Teams should use nonverbal communication to embed the language in actions, gestures, and expressions.
# Masters should aim to teach their apprentices through the use of full sentences, and normal conversation.
# Teams should strive to have all their real communication occur in their language, not just specific instructional periods.
# It is important to recognize that language is part of culture, rather than being a separate entity from it.
# Teams should focus on developing the apprentice’s ability to speak and listen in their language, and think less about writing and grammatical analysis.
# Teams should develop activities to complete together, to allow for more opportunities for diverse language use.
# Whenever needed, audio and video recordings are encouraged to aid the apprentice.
# The concept of active learning is critical to the apprentice’s success.
# It is important to be attentive to  the needs of both members of the team.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

'''Multilingualism''' is the use of more than one [[language]], either by an individual speaker or by a community of speakers. It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber [[monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers in the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/content/download/1803/19986/file/AGlobalPerspectiveonBilingualism.pdf|title=A Global Perspective on Bilingualism and Bilingual Education (1999), G.

People who speak several languages are also called [[polyglotism|polyglots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/polyglot |title="Polyglot"|work= Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by [[Language acquisition|mechanisms]] about which scholars disagree. Children acquiring two languages from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language is usually dominant. 

People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The bilingual advantage in novel word learning |vauthors=Kaushanskaya M, Marian V |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=705–710 |year=2009 |doi=10.3758/PBR.16.4.705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]. Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]). Almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
The definition of multilingualism is a subject of debate in the same way as the definition of language fluency.  On one end of a sort of linguistic continuum, one may define multilingualism as complete competence and mastery in another language. The speaker would presumably have complete knowledge and control over the language so as to sound native. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be people who know enough phrases to get around as a tourist using the alternate language. Since 1992, [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|title=Multi-competence definition|author=|date=|website=www.viviancook.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022003750/http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that most multilingual speakers fall somewhere between minimal and maximal definitions.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101022728/http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |archivedate=1 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook calls these people ''multi-competent''.
In addition, there is no consistent definition of what constitutes a distinct language. For instance, scholars often disagree whether [[Scots language|Scots]] is a language in its own right or a dialect of [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.894&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, what is considered a language can change, often for purely political purposes, such as when [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was created as a [[standard language]] on the basis of the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] to function as [[Dachsprache|umbrella]] for numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] dialects, and after the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] was split into [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], or when [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was dismissed as a Russian dialect by the Russian [[tsar]]s to discourage national feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ems Ukaz]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many small independent nations' schoolchildren are today compelled to learn multiple languages because of international interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreign-language.org/|title=Writing With English As A Second Language|publisher=Foreign-Language.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235102/http://foreign-language.org/|archivedate=21 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Finland, all children are required to learn at least two foreign languages: the other national language (Swedish or Finnish) and one alien language (usually English). Many Finnish schoolchildren also select further languages, such as German or Russian.

In some large nations with multiple languages, such as India, schoolchildren may routinely learn multiple languages based on where they reside in the country. In major metropolitan areas of Central, Southern and Eastern India, many children may be fluent in four languages (the mother tongue, the state language, and the official languages of India, Hindi and English). Thus, a child of Telugu parents living in Bangalore will end up speaking his or her mother tongue (Telugu) at home and the state language (Kannada), Hindi and English in school and life.

==Myths surrounding multilingualism==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around the notions of bi- and multilingualism in some Western countries where monolingualism is the norm. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most common misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt;
* that bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* that in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all of one's languages;
* that childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* that exposing a child to more than one language may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
* that the children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.
* that the children would be confused with having the ability to speak two languages and the “tip-of-the-tongue states” For instance, where one knows the meaning and the specific details of a word, but cannot retrieve a word. 
* those bilingual individuals tend to have slightly fewer vocabularies and weaker in “verbal fluency tasks” than the monolingual counterpart 
These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents.

==Multilingual individuals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
A multilingual person is someone who can communicate in more than one language, either actively (through speaking, writing, or signing) or passively (through listening, reading, or perceiving). More specifically, the terms ''bilingual'' and ''trilingual'' are used to describe comparable situations in which two or three languages are involved. A multilingual person is generally referred to as a [[polyglotism|polyglot]].
Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by mechanisms heavily disputed. Children acquiring two languages in this way are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language usually dominates over the other.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt;
In linguistics, first language acquisition is closely related to the concept of a "native speaker". According to a view widely held by linguists, a native speaker of a given language has in some respects a level of skill which a second (or subsequent) language learner cannot easily accomplish. Consequently, descriptive empirical studies of languages are usually carried out using only native speakers. This view is, however, slightly problematic, particularly as many non-native speakers demonstrably not only successfully engage with and in their non-native language societies, but in fact may become culturally and even linguistically important contributors (as, for example, writers, politicians, media personalities and performing artists) in their non-native language. In recent years, linguistic research has focused attention on the use of widely known world languages, such as English, as a [[lingua franca]] or a shared common language of professional and commercial communities. In lingua franca situations, most speakers of the common language are functionally multilingual.

When acquisition of the first language is interrupted and insufficient or unstructured language input follows from the second language, as sometimes happens with [[Immigration|immigrant]] children, the speaker can end up with two languages both mastered below the monolingual standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A notable example can be found in the [[Bengali people|ethnic Bengali]] Muslim community of Assam province in India, hailing from [[Bangladesh|East Bengal]]. Their mother tongue is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but they have no opportunity to study it in the school. Their medium language of study is [[Assamese language|Assamese]], the provincial language. As a result, their predominant form of communication mixes the mother tongue and the medium language. Because they have no chance to study both the languages separately, they can't differentiate between the two or maintain such a difference in expression. Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in these immigrant children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Those who were literate in their first language before arriving, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are at the very least able to maintain and master their first language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
There are differences between those who learn a language in a class environment and those who learn through total [[language immersion|immersion]], usually living in a country where the target language is widely spoken. Without the possibility to actively translate, due to a complete lack of any first language communication opportunity, the comparison between languages is reduced. The new language is almost independently learned, like the mother tongue for a child, with direct concept-to-language translation that can become more natural than word structures learned as a subject. Added to this, the uninterrupted, immediate and exclusive practice of the new language reinforces and deepens the attained knowledge.

===Economic benefits===
Bilinguals might have important labor market advantages over monolingual individuals as bilingual people are able to carry out duties that monolinguals cannot, such as
interacting with customers who only speak a minority language. A study in Switzerland has found that multilingualism is positively correlated with an individual's salary, the productivity of firms, and the gross domestic production (GDP); the authors state that Switzerland's GDP is augmented by 10% by multilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grin|first1=François|last2=Sfreddo|first2=Claudio|last3=Vaillancourt|first3=François|title=Economics of the multilingual workplace.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-415-85106-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the United States by Agirdag found that bilingualism has substantial economic benefits as bilingual persons were found to have around $3,000 per year more salary than monolinguals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Agirdag, O. |title=The long-term effects of bilingualism on children of immigration: student bilingualism and future earnings |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=449–464 |year=2014  |doi=10.1080/13670050.2013.816264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Receptive bilingualism===
{{Main article|Passive speakers (language)}}
Receptive bilinguals are those who have the ability to understand a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of "[[code-switching]]" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as [[mutual intelligibility]] of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of ''languages'', namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (''e.g.'', Iberian Spanish and Iberian Portuguese), whereas the former is a property of one or more ''persons'' and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |title=Ethnologue report for language code: spa |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418134038/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Because it is difficult or impossible to master many of the high-level semantic aspects of a language (including but not limited to its [[idiom]]s and [[eponym]]s) without first understanding the culture and history of the region in which that language evolved, as a practical matter an in-depth familiarity with multiple cultures is a prerequisite for high-level multilingualism.  This knowledge of cultures individually and comparatively, or indeed the mere fact of one's having that knowledge, often forms an important part of both what one considers one's own personal identity to be and what others consider that identity to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halwachs|first=D.W.|title=Polysystem repertoire and identity|journal=Grazer Linguistische Studien|year=1993|volume=39–40|pages=71–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some studies have found that groups of multilingual individuals get higher average scores on tests for certain personality traits such as cultural [[empathy]], [[open-mindedness]] and social initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=Multilingualism, empathy, and multicompetence|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|year=2012|pages=1–15|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009194907/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=The effect of multilingualism, sociobiographical, and situational factors on communicative anxiety and foreign language anxiety of mature language learners|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|year=2007|volume=11|pages=391–409|doi=10.1177/13670069070110040301|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of [[linguistic relativity]], which claims that the language people speak influences the way they see the world, can be interpreted to mean that individuals who speak multiple languages have a broader, more diverse view of the world, even when speaking only one language at a time.&lt;ref name="Grosjean 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosjean|first=F|title=Life as a bilingual: the reality of living with two or more languages|journal=Psychology Today|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some bilinguals feel that their personality changes depending on which language they are speaking;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=T.|title=The multilingual mind: Issues discussed by, for, and about people living with many languages|year=2003|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=X.|title=Growing up with three languages: Birth to eleven|year=2008|publisher=Multilingualism Matters|location=Briston, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus multilingualism is said to create multiple personalities. Xiao-lei Wang states in her book ''Growing up with Three Languages: Birth to Eleven'': "Languages used by speakers with one or more than one language are used not just to represent a unitary self, but to enact different kinds of selves, and different linguistic contexts create different kinds of self-expression and experiences for the same person." However, there has been little rigorous research done on this topic and it is difficult to define "personality" in this context. [[François Grosjean]] wrote: "What is seen as a change in personality is most probably simply a shift in attitudes and behaviors that correspond to a shift in situation or context, independent of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Living with two languages and two cultures, chapter in: Cultural and Language Diversity and the Deaf Experience. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=François Grosjean (author of chapter); Editor: I. Parasnis | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the [[Sapir-Whorf]] hypothesis, which states that a language shapes our vision of the world, may suggest that a language learned by a grown-up may have much fewer emotional [[connotation]]s and therefore allow a more serene discussion than a language learned by a child and to that respect more or less bound to a child's perception of the world. A 2013 study published in PLoS ONE found that rather than an emotion-based explanation, switching into the second language seems to exempt bilinguals from the social norms and constraints such as political correctness.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms.

==Learning language==
{{main article|Language education}}
One view is that of the [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] in what he calls the human [[language acquisition device]]—a mechanism which enables an individual to recreate correctly the rules and certain other characteristics of language used by speakers around the learner.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, John W. (2008).  Bilingualism and Second-Language Learning.  ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4th ed.)'' (pp. 330–335).  New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This device, according to Chomsky, wears out over time, and is not normally available by [[puberty]], which he uses to explain the poor results some adolescents and adults have when learning aspects of a [[second language]] (L2).

If language learning is a [[Cognition|cognitive process]], rather than a language acquisition device, as the school led by [[Stephen Krashen]] suggests, there would only be relative, not categorical, differences between the two types of language learning.

[[Rod Ellis]] quotes research finding that the earlier children learn a second language, the better off they are, in terms of [[pronunciation]]. See [[Critical period hypothesis]]. European schools generally offer secondary language classes for their students early on, due to the interconnectedness with neighbour countries with different languages. Most European students now study at least two foreign languages, a process strongly encouraged by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|title=EurActiv: Most EU students learn two foreign languages: Study, 28 September 2009, retrieved November 2011|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202853/http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relationship between age and second language productive ability. 27 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-1770.1975.tb00244.x/abstract|title=THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AND SECOND LANGUAGE PRODUCTIVE ABILITY|date=|accessdate=30 April 2016|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1975.tb00244.x|volume=25|journal=Language Learning|pages=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;  there is a difference in the rate of learning of English morphology, syntax and phonology based upon differences in age, but that the order of acquisition in second language learning does not change with age.

In [[second language]] class, students will commonly face the difficulties on thinking in the target language because they are influenced by their native language and culture patterns. Robert B. Kaplan thinks that in second language classes, the foreign-student paper is out of focus because the foreign student is employing rhetoric and a sequence of thought which violate the expectations of the native reader.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Robert B. "Cultural thought patterns in inter-cultural education language learning". 16.1-2(2006). 1-20. Wiley Online Library. Web. 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign students who have mastered syntactic structures have still demonstrated inability to compose adequate themes, term papers, theses, and dissertations. Robert B. Kaplan describes two key words that affect people when they learn a second language. [[Logic]] in the popular, rather than the logician's sense of the word, which is the basis of rhetoric, is evolved out of a culture; it is not universal. [[Rhetoric]], then, is not universal either, but varies, from culture to culture and even from time to time within a given culture.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; Language teachers know how to predict the differences between pronunciations or constructions in different languages, but they might be less clear about the differences between rhetoric, that is, in the way they use language to accomplish various purposes, particularly in writing.&lt;ref name="Gadda"&gt;Gadda, George.

==Psychology==
A study in 2012 has shown that using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. It was surmised that the [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]] disappeared when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. As human reasoning is shaped by two distinct modes of thought: one that is systematic, analytical and cognition-intensive, and another that is fast, unconscious and emotionally charged, it was believed that a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. Therefore, those who speak two languages have better critical thinking and decision making skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2014, another study has shown that people using a foreign language are more likely to make utilitarian decisions when faced with a moral dilemma, as in the [[trolley problem]]. The utilitarian option was chosen more often in ''the fat man'' case when presented in a foreign language. However, there was no difference in the switch track case. It was surmised that a foreign language lacks the emotional impact of one's native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Widespread multilingualism is one form of [[language contact]]. Multilingualism was common in the past: in early times, when most people were members of small language communities, it was necessary to know two or more languages for trade or any other dealings outside one's own town or village, and this holds good today in places of high linguistic diversity such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[India]]. Linguist Ekkehard Wolff estimates that 50% of the population of Africa is multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Ekkehard (2000).  Language and Society. In: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse (Eds.) ''African Languages - An Introduction'', 317. Cambridge University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In multilingual societies, not all speakers need to be multilingual. Some states can have multilingual policies and recognize several official languages, such as Canada (English and French). In some states, particular languages may be associated with particular regions in the state (e.g., Canada) or with particular ethnicities (e.g., Malaysia and Singapore). When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved:
* '''[[Diglossia]]''': if there is a structural functional distribution of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in [[Europe]] where a [[regional language]] is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. [[Frisia]] (with [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Lusatia]] (with [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related, and could be considered dialects of each other.  This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, [[English language|English]] is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, [[Scots language|Scots]] is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen in the difference between written Arabic ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) and colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two have been created what some have deemed "Middle Arabic" or "Common Arabic". Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia&lt;ref&gt;M.HBakalla(1984), Arabic Culture through its Language and Literature, Kegan Paul International, London&lt;/ref&gt; has been suggested.
* '''Ambilingualism''': a region is called ambilingual if this functional distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area it is nearly impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like [[Luxembourg]], which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], which fuses the cultures of [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[China]], and [[India]] or communities with high rates of deafness like [[Martha's Vineyard]] where historically most inhabitants spoke both [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|MVSL]] and [[English language|English]] or in southern Israel where locals speak both [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language|ABSL]] and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a clearly dominant state language (be it ''de jure'' or ''de facto'') and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.
* '''Bipart-lingualism''': if more than one language can be heard in a small area, but the large majority of speakers are monolinguals, who have little contact with speakers from neighbouring ethnic groups, an area is called 'bipart-lingual'. An example of this is the [[Balkans]].

N.B. the terms given above all refer to situations describing only two languages. In cases of an unspecified number of languages, the terms '''polyglossia''', '''omnilingualism''', and '''multipart-lingualism''' are more appropriate.

==Multilingualism between different language speakers==
Whenever two people meet, negotiations take place. If they want to express solidarity and sympathy, they tend to seek common features in their behavior. If speakers wish to express distance towards or even dislike of the person they are speaking to, the reverse is true, and differences are sought. This mechanism also extends to language, as described in the [[Communication Accommodation Theory]].

Some multilinguals use [[code-switching]], a term that describes the process of 'swapping' between languages. In many cases, code-switching is motivated by the wish to express loyalty to more than one cultural group,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} as holds for many immigrant communities in the New World. Code-switching may also function as a strategy where proficiency is lacking. Such strategies are common if the vocabulary of one of the languages is not very elaborated for certain fields, or if the speakers have not developed proficiency in certain lexical domains, as in the case of immigrant languages.

This code-switching appears in many forms. If a speaker has a positive attitude towards both languages and towards code-switching, many switches can be found, even within the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poplack Shana | authorlink = Shana Poplack | year = 1980 | title = Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en español": toward a typology of code-switching | url = | journal = Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = 7/8| pages = 581–618 | doi = 10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the speaker is reluctant to use code-switching, as in the case of a lack of proficiency, he might knowingly or unknowingly try to camouflage his attempt by converting elements of one language into elements of the other language through [[calque|calquing]]. This results in speakers using words like ''courrier noir'' (literally mail that is black) in French, instead of the proper word for [[blackmail]], ''chantage''.

Sometimes a [[pidgin language]] may develop. A pidgin language is a fusion of two languages that is mutually understandable for both speakers. Some pidgin languages develop into real languages (such as [[Papiamento]] in [[Curaçao]] or [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]]) while others remain as slangs or jargons (such as [[Helsinki slang]], which is more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] both in Finnish and Swedish).{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} In other cases, prolonged influence of languages on each other may have the effect of changing one or both to the point where it may be considered that a new language is born. For example, many linguists believe that the [[Occitan language]] and the [[Catalan language]] were formed because a population speaking a single Occitano-Romance language was divided into political spheres of influence of France and Spain, respectively. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is a complex blend of [[Middle High German]] with [[Hebrew]] and borrowings from Slavic languages.

Bilingual interaction can even take place without the speakers switching. In certain areas, it is not uncommon for speakers each to use a different language within the same conversation. This phenomenon is found, amongst other places, in [[Scandinavia]]. Most speakers of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages, while few can speak both (people used to these situations often adjust their language, avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood). Using different languages is usually called [[non-convergent discourse]], a term introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist Reitze Jonkman. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} To a certain extent, this situation also exists between [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities. Another example is the former state of [[Czechoslovakia]], where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) were in common use. Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages, although they would use only one of them (their respective mother tongue) when speaking. For example, in Czechoslovakia it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other. This bilinguality still exists nowadays, although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Multilingualism at the linguistic level==

===Models for native language literacy programs===
Sociopolitical as well as socio-cultural identity arguments may influence native language literacy.  While these two camps may occupy much of the debate about which languages children will learn to read, a greater emphasis on the linguistic aspects of the argument is appropriate. In spite of the political turmoil precipitated by this debate, researchers continue to espouse a linguistic basis for it.  This rationale is based upon the work of Jim Cummins (1983).&lt;!--- this paragraph is not intelligible ---&gt;

===Sequential model===
{{Main article|Sequential bilingualism}}
In this model, learners receive literacy instruction in their native language until they acquire a "threshold" literacy proficiency. Some researchers use age 3 as the age when a child has basic communicative competence in their first language (Kessler, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.hanen.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530230334/http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may go through a process of sequential acquisition if they migrate at a young age to a country where a different language is spoken, or if the child exclusively speaks his or her heritage language at home until he/she is immersed in a school setting where instruction is offered in a different language.

The phases children go through during sequential acquisition are less linear than for simultaneous acquisition and can vary greatly among children. Sequential acquisition is a more complex and lengthier process, although there is no indication that non-language-delayed children end up less proficient than simultaneous bilinguals, so long as they receive adequate input in both languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Bilingual model===
{{Main article|Simultaneous bilingualism}}
In this model, the native language and the community language are simultaneously taught. The advantage is literacy in two languages as the outcome. However, the teacher must be well-versed in both languages and also in techniques for teaching a second language.

===Coordinate model===
This model posits that equal time should be spent in separate instruction of the native language and of the community language. The native language class, however, focuses on basic literacy while the community language class focuses on listening and speaking skills. Being a bilingual does not necessarily mean that one can speak, for example, English and French.

===Outcomes===
{{Citation style|section|date=June 2018}}
Cummins' research concluded that the development of competence in the native language serves as a foundation of proficiency that can be transposed to the second language — the common underlying proficiency hypothesis.  His work sought to overcome the perception propagated in the 1960s that learning two languages made for two competing aims. The belief was that the two languages were mutually exclusive and that learning a second required unlearning elements and dynamics of the first in order to accommodate the second (Hakuta, 1990). The evidence for this perspective relied on the fact that some errors in acquiring the second language were related to the rules of the first language (Hakuta, 1990). How this hypothesis holds under different types of languages such as Romance versus non-Western languages has yet to undergo research.

Another new development that has influenced the linguistic argument for bilingual literacy is the length of time necessary to acquire the second language.  While previously children were believed to have the ability to learn a language within a year, today researchers believe that within and across academic settings, the time span is nearer to five years (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).

An interesting outcome of studies during the early 1990s however confirmed that students who do successfully complete bilingual instruction perform better academically (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).  These students exhibit more cognitive elasticity including a better ability to analyse abstract visual patterns.  Students who receive bidirectional bilingual instruction where equal proficiency in both languages is required perform at an even higher level.  Examples of such programs include international and multi-national education schools.

==Multilingualism in computing==
[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]

With emerging markets and expanding international cooperation, business users expect to be able to use software and applications in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;Dedić, N. and Stanier C., 2016., "An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development" in 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2016, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingualisation (or "m17n", where "17" stands for 17 omitted letters) of computer systems can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]:
* A localized system has been adapted or converted for a particular locale (other than the one it was originally developed for), including the language of the user interface, input, and display, and features such as time/date display and currency; but each instance of the system only supports a single locale.
* Multilingualised software supports multiple languages for display and input simultaneously, but generally has a single user interface language.  Support for other locale features like time, date, number and currency formats may vary as the system tends towards full internationalisation.  Generally a multilingualised system is intended for use in a specific locale, whilst allowing for multilingual content.
* An internationalised system is equipped for use in a range of locales, allowing for the co-existence of several languages and character sets in user interfaces and displays.  In particular, a system may not be considered internationalised in the fullest sense unless the interface language is selectable by the user at runtime.

Translating the user interface is usually part of the [[software localization]] process, which also includes adaptations such as units and date conversion. Many software applications are available in several languages, ranging from a handful (the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]]) to dozens for the most popular applications (such as [[office suite]]s, [[web browser]]s, etc.).  Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]), so almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|title=Multilingual Functionality: New in Wolfram Language 11|website=www.wolfram.com|access-date=2016-08-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820020128/http://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism in the workplace==

Globalization has led the world to be more deeply interconnected. Consequences of this are that more and more companies are trading with foreign countries, and with countries that don't necessarily speak the same language. English has become an important working knowledge mainly in multinational companies, but also in smaller companies. NGO workers are also faced with multilingualism when intervening on the field and use both linguistic and non-verbal strategies to communicate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bencherki|first1=Nicolas|last2=Matte|first2=Frédérik|last3=Pelletier|first3=Émilie|title=

=== Multilingualism in English speaking countries ===
According to Hewitt (2008) entrepreneurs in London from Poland, China or Turkey use English mainly for communication with customers, suppliers and banks, but their own native languages for work tasks and social purposes.
Even in English speaking countries immigrants are still able to use their own mother tongue in the workplace thanks to other immigrants from the same place. Kovacs (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kovacs|first1=M.|title=Australian Finns on the verge of language shift|date=2004|pages=108, 200–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes this phenomenon in Australia with Finnish immigrants in the construction industry who spoke Finnish during working hours.
But even though foreign languages may be used in the workplace, English is still a must-know working skill. Mainstream society justifies the divided job market, arguing that getting a low-paying job is the best newcomers can achieve considering their limited language skills.

=== Multilingualism in Asia===
With companies going international they are now focusing more and more on the English level of their employees. Especially in South Korea since the 1990s, companies are using different English language testing to evaluate job applicants, and the criteria in those tests are constantly upgrading the level for good English. In India it is even possible to receive training to acquire an English accent, as the number of outsourced call centres in India has soared in the past decades.
Meanwhile, Japan ranks 26th out of 63 countries in a 2014 English Proficiency Index, amid calls for this to improve in time for the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Within multiracial countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], it is not unusual for one to speak two or more languages, albeit with varying degrees of fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=9 of the world's most multilingual countries|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|publisher=Mother Nature Network|date=28 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210034/http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=

=== Multilingualism in Africa===
Not only in multinational companies is English an important skill, but also in the engineering industry, in the chemical, electrical and aeronautical fields. A study directed by Hill and van Zyl (2002) shows that in South Africa young black engineers used English most often for communication and documentation. However, Afrikaans and other local languages were also used to explain particular concepts to workers in order to ensure understanding and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in the Workplace|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|date=2013|volume=33|pages=162–&amp;volumeId=33&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9090498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilingualism in Europe ===
In Europe, as the domestic market is generally quite restricted, international trade is a norm. But there is no predominant language in Europe (with [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German]] spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium; [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French]] in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland; and [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English]] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta). Most of the time, English is used as a communication language, but in multilingual countries such as Belgium (Dutch, French and German), Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romanche), Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) or Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician), it is common to see employees mastering two or even three of those languages. Some languages such as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian or Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian and Bosnian are so close to each other that it is generally more common for meeting to use their mother tongue rather than English.

Continued global [[diversity (business)|diversity]] has led to an increasingly multilingual workforce. Europe has become an excellent model to observe this newly diversified labor culture. The expansion of the European Union with its open labor market has provided opportunities both for well-trained professionals and unskilled workers to move to new countries to seek employment. Political changes and turmoil have also led to migration and to the creation of new and more complex multilingual workplaces. In most wealthy and secure countries, immigrants are found mostly in low paid jobs but also, increasingly, in high status positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarsson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in European Workplaces.|date=2014|volume=33|pages=11–33|doi=10.1515/multi-2014-0002|journal=Multilingua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism in music==
{{further information|List of multilingual bands and artists}}
It is extremely common for music to be written in whatever the contemporary [[lingua franca]] is. If a song is not written in a common tongue, then it is usually written in whatever is the predominant language in the musician's country of origin, or in another widely recognized language, such as English, German, Spanish, or French.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The bilingual song cycles "there..." and "Sing, Poetry" on the 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] consist of musical settings of Russian poems with their English self-translations by [[Joseph Brodsky]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A "Troika: Russia's westerly poetry in three orchestral song cycles"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171103083529/https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A |date=3 November 2017 }}, Rideau Rouge Records, ASIN: B005USB24A, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opening-statement-legalman-mock-trial-Dec-23-08.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[legalman]] making an opening statement for the prosecution to a jury during a [[mock trial]].]]
An '''opening statement''' is generally the first occasion that the [[trier of fact]] ([[jury]] or [[judge]]) has to hear from a lawyer in a [[trial (law)|trial]], aside possibly from questioning during [[voir dire]].  The opening statement is generally constructed to serve as a "road map" for the fact-finder.  This is especially essential, in many jury trials, since jurors (at least theoretically) know nothing at all about the case before the trial, (or if they do, they are strictly instructed by the judge to put preconceived notions aside).   Though such statements may be dramatic and vivid, they must be limited to the [[evidence]] reasonably expected to be presented during the trial.  Attorneys generally conclude opening statements with a reminder that at the conclusion of evidence, the attorney will return to ask the fact-finder to find in his or her client's favor.

Opening statements are, in theory, not allowed to be [[argumentative]], or suggest the inferences that fact-finders should draw from the evidence they will hear.  In actual practice, the line between statement and argument is often unclear and many attorneys will infuse at least a little argumentation into their opening (often prefacing borderline arguments with some variation on the phrase, "As we will show you...").  [[Objection (law)|Objections]], though permissible during opening statements, are very unusual, and by professional courtesy are usually reserved only for egregious conduct.

Generally, the [[prosecution]] in a criminal case and [[plaintiff]] in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]] is the first to offer an opening statement, and defendants go second.  Defendants are also allowed the option of delaying their opening statement until after the close of the prosecution or plaintiff's case.  Few take this option, however, so as not to allow the other party's argument to stand uncontradicted for so long.

The techniques of opening statements are taught in courses on [[trial advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy'', NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 415 et. seq., {{ISBN|1556818866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening statement is integrated with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S.; ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012 pp. 46–73, {{ISBN|0615676952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific tactics that can be incorporated in an opening statement are audio-visual elements, a clear overview of the coming presentation, and using deposition testimony to highlight key information they can expect of upcoming witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Tom (PhD) &amp; Schmid, Jill (PhD); Tsongas Litigation Consulting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2653">'''Radical interpretation''' is interpretation of a speaker, including attributing beliefs and desires to them and meanings to their words, from scratch—that is, without relying on translators, dictionaries, or specific prior knowledge of their mental states.  The term was introduced by American philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1973) and is meant to suggest important similarity to [[W. V. O. Quine]]'s term [[radical translation]], which occurs in his work on the [[indeterminacy of translation]]. Radical translation
is translation of a speaker's language, without prior knowledge, by observing the speaker's use of the language in context.&lt;ref name="RI"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation. Originally published in Dialectica, 27 (1973), 314-28. Reprinted in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (2n. ed. 125-39). New York: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more so than radical translation did for Quine, radical interpretation plays an important role in Davidson's work, but the exact nature of this role is up for debate.  Some see Davidson as using radical interpretation directly in his arguments against conceptual relativism and the possibility of massive error--of most of our beliefs being false.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;Lepore, Ernest and Kirk Ludwig. ''Donald Davidson: Meaning, Truth, Language and Reality''. Oxford. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Davidson seems to explicitly reject this reading in "Radical Interpretation Interpreted".&lt;ref name="RII"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation Interpreted. Philosophical Perspectives, 8 (1994), 121-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a more narrow and technical version of radical interpretation used by Davidson:&lt;ref name="RII"/&gt; given the speaker's attitudes of holding particular sentences true in particular circumstances, the speaker's hold-true attitudes, the radical interpreter is to infer a theory of meaning, a truth theory meeting a modified version of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[Convention T]], for the speaker's [[idiolect]].  [[Ernest Lepore]] and [[Kirk Ludwig]] characterize this as inference from sentences of the form:

:Ceteris paribus, S holds true s at t if and only if p.
to corresponding [[T-sentences]] of the form

:s is true (S, t) if and only if q
where s is a sentence in the idiolect of the speaker S, t is a time, and p and q are filled in with sentences in the [[metalanguage]].&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5419">The '''Jane Schaffer paragraph'''  is a five-sentence paragraph developed by Jane Schaffer, used to write essays.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huertas.vms.lusd.org/Johnschafferhowsto.html|title=John Schaffer How-To&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paragraph only makes up one of many paragraphs in an essay, most of which have a non-Schaffer-like introduction and conclusion. The structure is utilized because it is thought to help students who struggle with paragraph structure and is taught in some U.S. [[middle school]]s and in early [[high school]] classes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Popularity of Formulaic Writing (And Why We Need to Resist)|journal= The English Journal|volume= 90|issue= 1|pages= 61–67|author= |jstor=821733|last1= Wiley|first1= Mark|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |title= Toward Maturity in Judging Fiction: An Approach to Schaefer's "Shane"|journal= The English Journal|volume= 49|issue= 1|pages= 22–26|author= |jstor=808912|last1= Dunning|first1= A. Stephen|year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
General Schaffer paragraphs have some requirements as follows:
*Must not be written in [[first-person narrative|first person]]
*Every paragraph must be at least five sentences long; however, there can be more as long as the same ratio of two CMs to every CD is kept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutvalley.k12.ca.us/dbhs/stenace/johnshaffer.htm|title=John Schaffer Paragraph Construction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Each section (TS, CD, CM, CS) is only one sentence in length
*Each section should also avoid past tense and only be written in present tense

==Paragraph Structure==
*Topic Sentence (TS) Otherwise known as a Topic Ghey
*Concrete Detail (CD)            
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

A basic Schaffer paragraph begins with the topic sentence—stating what the paragraph is about, then followed by a concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a closing sentence. This is called a one-chunk body paragraph and is the most basic Schaffer model.

One of the key elements in the Schaffer program is what is called the "ratio." Ratio is the amount of Concrete Detail in a paragraph compared to the amount of commentary. In the above paragraph the ratio is 1:2. The actual ratio for response to literature is 1:2+, which means there must be at least two sentences of Commentary for each sentence of Concrete Detail like so:

*Topic sentence (TS)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

Note that the ratio is still 1:2+ (At least twice as much Commentary as there is Concrete Detail)

===Topic sentence/statement (TS)===
This sentence should state the main point of the paragraph and be straight to the point
:''Example 1: Cinderella lives a miserable life.''
:''Example 2: Global warming is a world problem and needs to be stopped.''

===Concrete detail (CD)===
This sentence is the  "what" is happening.  It should be either facts, examples, illustrations, evidence, support, plot references, [[paraphrase]]s, [[citations]], quotations, plot summary, etc.  It should be a concrete detail and should start with ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;for example&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or a different [[Transition words|transition]].
:''Example 1: For example, she does all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. ''
:''Example 2: If it is not stopped, statistics show that the world will be drastically hurt. ''

===Commentary (CM)===
There are one or two [[wikt:commentary|commentary]] sentences in each chunk.  They contain no facts, rather, comments from the paragraph writer about the fact presented in the CD. This sentence contains analysis, interpretation, character feelings, opinions, inference, insight, reasons, or color commentator.   It is important that the commentary explain how the concrete detail helps prove the writer's point (the TS).
:''Example 1:''
::CM1: ''This shows that she feels taken advantage of by her selfish stepmother and stepsisters.''
::CM2: ''This is important because her horrible life gives her a present, her fairy godmother.''
:''Example 2:''
::CM1: ''Global warming should be man's greatest worry.''
::CM2: ''This is because the Earth can become negatively and drastically affected world wide.
::CM3  '' Commentary sentence is an opinion and a reaction.

General practice is that commentary sentences often start with a [[Transitions (linguistics)|transition]] such as the following:
*This (also) shows that
*This is (important) because
*In addition
*Furthermore,
*Therefore,
*Also
*For example,

===Concluding sentence / closing sentence (CS)===
The Concluding Sentence (CS) is the closing sentence that wraps up the TS and sums up the paragraph. It closes up the thoughts and gives insight to the next paragraph. Emotional or connotative words are preferred here usually beginning with "As a result" or another concluding sentence.
:''Example 1: As a result, she becomes a princess.''
:''Example 2: Therefore, global warming is top priority and cannot be ignored.''

{{Semantics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''semantic analysis''' is the process of relating [[syntactic structure]]s, from the levels of [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s and [[paragraph]]s to the level of the [[writing]] as a whole, to their language-independent [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. It also involves removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural contexts, to the extent that such a project is possible.  The elements of [[idiom]] and [[figure of speech|figurative speech]], being cultural, are often also converted into relatively invariant meanings in semantic analysis. Semantics, although related to [[pragmatics]], is distinct in that the former deals with word or sentence choice in any given context, while pragmatics considers the unique or particular meaning derived from context or tone. To reiterate in different terms, semantics is about universally coded meaning, and pragmatics, the meaning encoded in words that is then interpreted by an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|title=Semantic Analysis: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=17|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic analysis can begin with the relationship between individual words.  This requires an understanding of lexical hierarchy, including [[hyponymy and hypernymy]], [[meronomy]], [[polysemy]], synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Christopher|last2=Scheutze|first2=Hinrich|title=Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also relates to concepts like [[connotation (semiotics)]] and collocation, which is the particular combination of words that can be or frequently are surrounding a single word.  This can include idioms, metaphor, and simile, like, "white as a ghost."

With the availability of enough material to analyze, semantic analysis can be used to catalog and trace the style of writing of specific authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miranda-Garcıa|first1=Antonio|last2=Calle-Martın|first2=Javier|title=The Authorship of the Disputed Federalist Papers with an Annotated Corpus|journal=English Studies|date=May 2012|volume=93|issue=3|pages=371–390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Linguists''''' is an [[Independent film|independent]] 2008 American [[documentary film]] produced by [[Ironbound Films]] about [[language extinction]] and [[language documentation]].  It follows two [[linguist]]s, [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages]]&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/02/26/1810643.aspx/ | title=The Race To Save Our Languages | date=26 February 2009 | accessdate=13 July 2009 | last=Boyle | first=Alan | work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[K.

==Production==
Seth Kramer, one of the directors, describes how he first got the idea for ''The Linguists'' when, in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], he could not read [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] inscriptions on a path in spite of his [[Jewish]] heritage. He joined with Daniel A. Miller in 2003 to form Ironbound Films, and received a $520,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to support the film.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Later in 2003, the directors chose [[Gregory Anderson (linguist)|Anderson]] and Harrison to be the protagonists of the film.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; In 2004, director Jeremy Newberger joined the project.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

It took three years to film ''The Linguists'', and during this time over 200 hours of film were collected.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  During this time, the cast and crew travelled to numerous remote areas that one reporter describes as "godforsaken,"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; and coped with physical ailments such as [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The film was completed in August 2007.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | date=13 January 2008 | last=Hughes | first=Jennifer V | accessdate=22 February 2009 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/13artswe.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Racing to Capture Vanishing Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The film begins with the fact that a large proportion of the world's languages (half, out of a total of 7,000, according to the film&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=22 February 2009 | date=2 October 2008 | last=Garreau | first=Joel | title=Babble On, Say Researchers In 'Linguists' Documentary | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/01/AR2008100103115.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are going extinct.  The film's two protagonists, Anderson and Harrison, set out both to gather recordings of several endangered languages in order to document these languages later, and to educate viewers about the current rate of language extinction.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  In the process, they travel to the [[Andes mountains]] in [[South America]], to villages in Siberia, to English-[[Hindi language|Hindi]] boarding schools in Orissa, India, and to an [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservation]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

The film addresses issues including the spread of major [[World language|global languages]] and how they contribute to language extinction;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web | title=Saving Dying Languages in 'The Linguists' | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | work=[[Weekend Edition]] | date=21 February 2009 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100874724}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and social reasons that some languages have been repressed;&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web | title=Say It Loud, Say It Proud | last=Ellison | first=Jesse | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=14 February 2009 | accessdate=21 February 2009 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/184809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasons that [[language revitalization]] and language documentation are important (including both maintaining a scientific record of that language, and preserving unique local knowledge and history that is only carried in the local language).&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

==Reception==
The film was screened at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite web | last=Chang | first=Justin | url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2471&amp;reviewid=VE1117935820&amp;cs=1 | title=Sundance 2008: The Linguists | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate=22 February 2009 | date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later had success on the "indie film circuit."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  It also received attention among the linguistics community on websites such as [[Language Log]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1163 | date=21 February 2009 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | work=[[Language Log]] | title=Set your recorders now! | first=Eric | last=Baković}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Transitions''' in [[fiction]] are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or [[punctuation]] that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[narrative mode|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p.

==Purpose==
Transitions provide for a seamless [[narrative]] flow as a story shifts in time, location, or [[Point of view (fiction) | point-of view]].  They aid the internal logic of a story by moving readers from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, idea to idea, [[scene (drama)|scene]] to scene, and [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] to chapter with grace and ease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Transitions in fiction may take any of several forms, including [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] breaks, [[section break]]s, and [[:wikt:summarization|summarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 258-265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p.

An '''umbrella term''' is a word or phrase that covers a wide range of concepts belonging to a common [[Categorization|category]]. For example, ''[[cryptology]]'' is an umbrella term that encompasses [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]], among other fields. Similarly, an [[umbrella organization]] is a central and coordinating body representing a number of smaller, separate bodies.

A '''blanket term''' is a closely related [[morpheme|word]] or [[phrase]] that is used to describe multiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary or have a minimal relationship, but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease of use. In other words, a blanket term, by itself, gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but it is easy to say and remember. Blanket terms may originate as [[slang]] but eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary.
