The '''Aldwych farces''' were a series of twelve stage [[farce]]s presented at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London, nearly continuously from 1923 to 1933. All but three of them were written by [[Ben Travers]]. They incorporate and develop British low comedy styles, combined with clever word-play. The plays were presented by the actor-manager [[Tom Walls]] and starred Walls and [[Ralph Lynn]], supported by a regular company that included [[Robertson Hare]], [[Mary Brough]], [[Winifred Shotter]], [[Ethel Coleridge]] and [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]]. 

The farces were so popular that touring companies were sent to present them in the British provinces.  Most of the Aldwych farces were adapted for film in the 1930s, starring the original stage casts as far as possible. The plays were later seen in television versions, and some enjoyed revivals.

==History==
[[Leslie Henson]] and [[Tom Walls]] co-produced the farce ''[[Tons of Money (play)|Tons of Money]]'' in 1922 at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]]. This was a great popular success, running for nearly two years, and they collaborated again, moving to the Aldwych Theatre. Walls secured a cheap, long-term lease on the theatre, which had fallen so far out of fashion with playgoers that it had been used as a [[YMCA]] hostel during the First World War.&lt;ref name=prog&gt;Programme booklet for ''Plunder'', [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], March 1976, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Aldwych Theatre 3.jpg|left|thumb|The Aldwych Theatre today]]
The first in the Aldwych farce series was ''[[It Pays to Advertise]]'', which ran for nearly 600 performances.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Mr. Ralph Lynn", ''[[The Times]]'', 10 August 1962, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Ben Travers]]'s first play, ''The Dippers'', based on his 1920 novel of the same name, was produced and directed by [[Charles Hawtrey (19th century actor)|Sir Charles Hawtrey]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dippers", ''Western Daily Press'', 24 May 1922, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It became a success on tour from 1921 and in another London theatre in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Travers, Master of Farce, Bows Out", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 19 December 1980, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Grossmith]] had acquired the rights to Travers's farce ''[[A Cuckoo in the Nest]]'' and sold them to Walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/92341 Ben Travers], British Film Institute, accessed 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It took Travers some time to establish a satisfactory working relationship with Walls, whom he found difficult as an [[actor-manager]], and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. In the early days he also had reservations about the other star of the company, [[Ralph Lynn]], who initially ad-libbed too much for the author's taste.&lt;ref&gt;Travers noted that the ad-libbing diminished as he came to anticipate and include in his scripts "the sort of thing Ralph himself would have said in the circumstances". Travers, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Travers built on each play, and the characterisations in the earlier plays, in writing the next farce for the company; and even Walls's calls to the stage manager for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.&lt;ref name=Selective&gt;Smith, pp. 50–69&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aldwych farces also featured a regular team of supporting actors: [[Robertson Hare]] as a figure of put-upon respectability; [[Mary Brough]] in eccentric old lady roles; [[Ethel Coleridge]] as the severe voice of authority; the saturnine [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]] as the "heavy"; and first [[Yvonne Arnaud]], then [[Winifred Shotter]], as the sprightly young female lead.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The plays generally revolved around a series of preposterous incidents involving a misunderstanding, borrowed clothes and lost trousers, involving the worldly Walls character, the innocent yet cheeky Lynn, the hapless Hare, the beefy, domineering Brough, the lean, domineering Coleridge and the pretty and slightly spicy Shotter, all played with earnest seriousness.&lt;ref name=Selective/&gt; The scripts incorporated and developed British [[low comedy]] styles, particularly "silly-asses, henpecked husbands, battleaxe mothers-in-law and lots of innocent misunderstandings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm Archive: "Tom Walls (1883 – 1949)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916142827/http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm |date=16 September 2012 }}, British Pictures.com, accessed 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The farces proved popular, and touring casts were regularly sent to the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Local and District News", ''Western Gazette'', 15 August 1930, pp. 4–5; and "Aldwych Farce at the Repertory", ''Western Morning News'', 13 May 1933, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some touring players, such as William Daunt (1893–1938) who played the Ralph Lynn roles, made considerable personal successes in the 1920s playing Aldwych farces in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Prince's Theatre: Rookery Nook", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 14 December 1926, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn's younger brother Hastings Lynn, played his brother's roles in successful productions in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;"Criterion – A Cuckoo In The Nest", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 31 December 1927, p. 7; "Rookery Nook", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 21 April 1928, p. 12; "Criterion – Thark", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 June 1928, p. 10; and "Stage Jottings", ''[[Auckland Star]]'', Volume LIX, Issue 201, 25 August 1928, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among the up-and-coming performers who appeared in Aldwych farces before becoming famous were [[Roger Livesey]],&lt;ref&gt;"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1925, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margot Grahame]],&lt;ref name= anlt&gt;"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'' , 19 February 1930, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norma Varden]].&lt;ref name=anlt/&gt;

After five years of extraordinary success, Walls's business partnership with Henson ended in September 1927 during the run of ''Thark'', and from October the Aldwych farces were presented by the firm of Tom Walls and Reginald Highley Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatres", ''The Times'', 28 September 1927, p. 12; and 3 October 1927, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, Walls was losing interest in the theatre, turning his attention to the cinema. He did not appear in the last three of the twelve Aldwych farces, which had disappointing runs. The last of them, ''[[A Bit of a Test]]'' in 1933, ran for 142 performances, compared with runs of more than 400 performances for some of the earlier productions.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 1952, three years after Walls's death, Lynn and Hare starred at the Aldwych in a new Travers farce, ''[[Wild Horses (play)|Wild Horses]]''. It ran from 6 November 1952 to 11 April 1953.&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 3 November 1952, p. 9, and 27 March 1953, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and early 1960s, a similar hit series of farces began at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] and came to be known as [[Whitehall farces]].&lt;ref name=Selective/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">[[Image:Sadlers_Wells_Theatre_edited.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A performance at Sadler's Wells, circa 1808.]]
The [[:Category:Theatrical genres|theatrical genre]] of '''aqua drama''' that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events;  some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage.&lt;ref name=H17&gt;Harrison, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as ''[[naumachia]]'', and the custom was resurrected at various times during the [[Middle Ages]].

== Beginning ==
At the start of the 19th century, the already established [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jane Austin's World&lt;/ref&gt; The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arundell p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb and Edwin 397&lt;/ref&gt; The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==19th century performances==
The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was ''The Siege of Gibralter.'' It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show:

''"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water’s edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause."''&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the [[Woolwich Dockyard]]s to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen “drowning” after the Spanish had been defeated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Arundell p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled ''The Island or Christian and His Comrades'' which dramatized the main events of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny on board HMS ''Bounty'']].&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kirk, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name=L4&gt;Ledger, p. f&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fall ==
Eventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the ''Siege of Gibraltar,'' and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cuickshank&lt;/ref&gt; The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military.&lt;ref&gt;Mather&lt;/ref&gt; A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.

== Legacy ==
Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Crompton&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.’s aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== New York ==
[[New York City]]'s [[Lafayette Circus (Theatre)|Lafayette Circus]] (1826-1829) boasted equipment for both [[Hippodrama|equestrian, or "Hippodrama"]], and aquatic dramas.&lt;ref name=B1136&gt;Banham, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1840, The [[Bowery Theatre]] in [[New York City]] produced ''The Pirates Signal''.  An immense stage was entirely covered by water upon which a full-rigged ship maneuvered. The scene took place upon the decks of the ship itself.&lt;ref name=B17&gt;Brown, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Redcoat is the name given to frontline staff at [[Butlins]] [[holiday camp]]s in the UK. A Redcoat has duties ranging from adult entertainer or children's entertainer to [[Stewardship|stewarding]].

==History==
[[File:Holiday Camp Gets Going Again- Everyday Life at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, Filey, Yorkshire, England, UK, 1945 D25923.jpg|left|thumb|Redcoats at Butlins [[Filey]] in 1947]]

The first Redcoat was [[Norman Bradford (Entertainer)|Norman Bradford]]. When Sir [[Billy Butlin]] opened his first Butlins in [[Skegness]] he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born.

The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed.&lt;ref name="Butlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories -Redcoats|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/other/redcoats.htm |publisher=Butlinsmemories.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

===Uniform===
[[File:2 Redcoats at Butlin's Minehead March 2011.jpg|thumb|Redcoats with former England football player George Cohen, March 2011]]
To make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red [[blazer]]s with white lapels and the '''Redcoat''' uniform was born. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry).

Over the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s).&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as [[Jeff Banks]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]] have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters "BHC" on (standing for "Butlins Holiday Camps") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform.

=== Recruitment and training ===
[[File:Female redcoat March 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A female Redcoat wearing pleated white skirt, March 2011]]

The Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only [[minimum wage]] and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case).&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{citation |title=Could you be a Redcoat?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2006/nov/03/couldyoubearedcoat|work=The Guardian |location=London|first=Ed|last=Ewing|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Redcoat Auditions|url=http://www.wearebutlins.com/redcoataudition/|publisher=WeArebutlins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Butlins Introduced the now defunct Butlins 'Academies of Excellence' to train Redcoats.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins loses hi-de-hi image|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/347557.stm|publisher=the BBC |date=19 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been replaced with a 6&amp;nbsp;week training course.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; There is also the option of a foundation degree in either musical theatre, or Technical Skills for the Arts and Leisure Industry&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoat degree at seaside resort|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7587695.stm|publisher=the BBC|date=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM1"&gt;{{citation|title=The boffins of Butlins: University offers degrees in the finer arts of being a holiday camp Redcoat|url=

===Roles===
Redcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort – Butlins even describe the role as "The Original Holiday Rep"&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1" /&gt; In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and ''[[X-Factor]]'' style game shows.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week.&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt;

==Similar staff==
{{further|Holiday camp#Frontline staff}}

Butlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at [[Pontins]] holiday camps,&lt;ref name="Pontins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories – Pontins|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/pontins/index.htm|publisher=butlinsmemories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point, Harry Warner decided [[Warner Leisure Hotels|Warners]]' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat.

==Media appearances==
The ITV series [[Redcoats (tv series)|''Redcoats'']] was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins [[Minehead]] and [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoats|url=http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm|publisher=Pilgrim Productions|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109054234/http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm#|archive-date=9 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
The BBC television series ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'', written by former Butlins employees [[Jimmy Perry]] (a Redcoat) and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] (summer show actor),&lt;ref name="DavidCroft1"&gt;{{citation |title=Croft and Perry|url=http://www.davidcroft.co.uk/Croft-Perry/|publisher=davidcroft.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show ''"Hi-de-Hi"'' originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded "Ho-de-ho".&lt;ref name="NotebookNews1"&gt;{{citation|title=Butlins at Clacton, a History of the Man and the Holiday Camp|url=http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html|publisher=notebooknews.co.uk|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102156/http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html#|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Citizen82"&gt;{{citation|title=Citizen 82 [Programme 2]|url=http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538|publisher=Central Television|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191247/http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538#|archive-date=13 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another BBC television series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', featured an episode entitled ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'', which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at [[Barry Island (holiday camp)|Barry Island]]). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras.&lt;ref name="DrWho1"&gt;{{citation |title=Delta and the Bannermen|url=http://www.mentalis.co.uk/sylvester-mccoy/delta-and-the-bannermen.aspx|publisher=mentalis.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable former Redcoats==
A number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; [[Stephen Mulhern]] notably performed on the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat,&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{citation |title=In-taxi with Stephen Mulhern|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1174331/In-taxi--Stephen-Mulhern.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Benji|last=Wilson|date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. [[Clinton Ford (singer)|Clinton Ford]], for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with "[[Old Shep]]" just after completing his final summer season at [[Penychain (holiday camp)|Pwllheli]]. However, prior to this in 1957 [[Russ Hamilton (singer)|Russ Hamilton]] recorded a number 2 hit in the UK "We Will Make Love" (held off the top spot by [[Elvis Presley]] and "[[All Shook Up]]"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song "Rainbow", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record "We Will Make Love" for the benefit of Butlins guests.&lt;ref name="Independant1"&gt;{{citation |title=Russ Hamilton: Liverpudlian singer-songwriter who had a hit in America years before the Beatles|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/russ-hamilton-liverpudlian-singersongwriter-who-had-a-hit-in-america-years-before-the-beatles-964176.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cypria''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Κύπρια}} ''Kúpria''; [[Latin]]: ''Cypria'') is a lost [[epic poetry|epic poem]] of ancient [[Greek literature]], which has been attributed to [[Stasinus]] and was quite well known in [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] (ii.117) refers to it.&lt;/ref&gt; and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the [[Epic Cycle]], which told the entire history of the [[Trojan War]] in epic hexameter verse. The story of the ''Cypria'' comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the ''[[Iliad]]''; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic [[dactylic hexameter]]s.

==Date and authorship==
The ''Cypria'', in the written form in which it was known in [[classical Greece]], was probably composed in the late seventh century BC,&lt;ref&gt;"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgement of Paris]] on the Chigi vase" (Burkert 1992:103). On the [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Orientalizing style|proto-Attic]] [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]] of ca. 640 BC called the [http://www.wisc.edu/arth/ah300/13-myth/33.image.html Chigi "vase"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Paris is identified as ''Al[exand]ros'', as he was apparently called in ''Cypria''.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted&lt;ref&gt;In his Preface to ''Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica''&lt;/ref&gt; "were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by [[Homer]]," one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of ''Cypria'' as post-Homeric, in effect a "[[prequel]]". "The author of the ''Kypria'' already regarded the ''Iliad'' as a text. Any reading of the ''Kypria'' will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the ''Iliad'' in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lykaon]] to [[Lemnos]] or the kitting out of [[Achilles]] with [[Briseis]] and [[Agamemnon]] with [[Chryseis]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Dowden]], "Homer's Sense of Text" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''116''' (1996, pp. 47-61). p 48, noting that the observation had been made by Eric Bethe, in ''Homer: Dichtung und Sage II: Odysee, Kyklos, Zeitbestimmung'', 1922:202.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison can be made with the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the ''Iliad'' as text.

The stories contained in the ''Cypria'', on the other hand, were fixed&lt;ref&gt;W. Kullmann's term ''Faktkanon'', the "canon of facts" is useful in distinguishing fixed narrative content— the list and sequence of facts— from fixed, [[Canon (fiction)|canonic texts]].&lt;/ref&gt; much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating [[oral tradition]]s associated with the [[Homer]]ic epics also apply to the ''Cypria''. Many or all of the stories in the ''Cypria'' were known to the composer(s) of the ''Iliad'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The ''Cypria'', in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the ''Iliad''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911: "[[Stasinus]]"&lt;/ref&gt; though there is an overlap in events from the death of [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]], including the catalogue of Trojan allies.{{sfn|Pinder|1995}} J. Marks observes that "Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the ''Kypria'' simply ended with the death of Palamedes."{{sfn|Pinder|1995|p=2}}

The title ''Cypria'', associating the epic with [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, (Burkert 1992:103) noting Mesopotamian parallels, concludes "these observations must then point to that epoch when Cyprus, though rich and powerful, was still formally under Assyrian domination".&lt;/ref&gt; demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition&lt;ref&gt;Recorded in [[John Tzetzes]]' ''Chiliades'' xiii.638.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been given by [[Homer]] as a dowry to his son-in-law, a [[Stasinus of Cyprus]] mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by [[Pindar]]. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the ''Cypria'' was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see [[Cyclic Poets]]).

It is possible that the "[[Trojan Battle Order]]" (the list of [[Troy|Trojans]] and their allies, of ''[[Iliad]]'' 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'') is abridged from that in the ''Cypria'', which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.

==Manuscript tradition==
In current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the ''Cypria'''s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the ''[[Chrestomathy]]'' attributed to an unknown "Proclus" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian [[Eutychius Proclus]], or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Chrestomathy'' itself was preserved in the ninth-century Patriarch [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]]' renowned ''Bibliotheca'' or ''Myriobiblon'', codex 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.

==Content==
What follows embeds reports of known content of the ''Cypria'' in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.

The poem narrates the origins of the [[Trojan War]] and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992: 101-04. Compare ''[[Atra-Hasis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seven Against Thebes|Theban war of the Seven]] ensues.

The ''Cypria'' described the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]; in the [[Judgement of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Paris is called ''Alexandros'' in quotations of ''Cypria'' and in the surviving synopsis.&lt;/ref&gt; among the goddesses [[Athena]], [[Hera]], and [[Aphrodite]]: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]].

Then Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and [[Helenus]] foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders [[Aeneas]] to sail with him, while [[Cassandra]] prophesies the outcome. In [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] the Trojans are entertained by the sons of [[Tyndareus]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]], and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen&lt;ref&gt;"In the Cypria, Nemesis was Helen's mother, born after Zeus raped the goddess, who had done her best to escape him." {{cite journal|last1=Scodel|first1=Ruth|title=Stupid, Pointless Wars|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|date=2008|volume=138|pages=219–235|doi=10.1353/apa.0.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her [[dowry]] back to his home of [[Troy]] with an episode at [[Sidon]], which Paris and his men successfully storm.

In the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of [[Idas]] and [[Lynceus]], are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.

[[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother [[Agamemnon]]. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] in a digression tells Menelaus how [[Epopeus]] was destroyed after seducing the daughter of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], the story of [[Oedipus]], the madness of [[Heracles]], and the story of [[Theseus]] and [[Ariadne]]. In gathering the leaders, they detect [[Odysseus]]' feigned madness.

The assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], where the prophet [[Calchas]] warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of [[Teuthras]] in [[Mysia]] and sack it in error for Ilium: [[Telephus]] comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by [[Achilles]]. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at [[Skyros]] and marries [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidameia]], the daughter of [[Lycomedes]], then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.

When the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to appease the goddess [[Artemis]] and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.
Artemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the [[Tauri]], making her immortal.

Next they sail as far as [[Tenedos]], where while they are feasting, [[Philoctetes]] is bitten by a snake and is left behind in [[Lemnos]]. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the [[Troad]] is repulsed by the Trojans, and [[Protesilaus]] is killed by [[Hector]]. Achilles then kills [[Cycnus]], the son of [[Poseidon]], and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.

Achilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and [[Thetis]] contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by
Achilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills [[Troilus]]. [[Patroclus]] carries away [[Lycaon (Troy)|Lycaon]] to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives [[Briseis]] as a prize, and Agamemnon [[Chryseis]].
Then follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.

==Reception==
The ''Cypria'' was considered to be a lesser work than [[Homer]]'s two masterpieces: [[Aristotle]] criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.

[[Image:HarryHoudini1899.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Houdini]] (1874–1926), a famous escapologist and [[magic (illusion)|magician]]]]
'''Escapology''' is the practice of escaping from [[physical restraint|restraint]]s or other traps. Escapologists (also classified as '''escape artists''') escape from [[handcuffs]], [[straitjackets]], [[Cage (enclosure)|cages]], [[coffins]], steel boxes, [[barrel]]s, bags, burning buildings, [[aquarium|fish-tanks]], and other perils, often in combination.

==History==
The art of escaping from restraints and confined spaces has been a skill employed by performers for a very long time. It was not originally displayed as an overt act in itself but was instead used secretly to create illusions such as a disappearance or transmutation.&lt;ref name="Dawes"&gt;{{citation
 |last = Dawes
 |first = Edwin A
 |title = The Great Illusionists
 |publisher = Chartwell Books (New Jersey)
 |year = 1979
 |page = 193
 |isbn = 0-89009-240-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, the [[Davenport Brothers]], who were skilled at releasing themselves from rope ties, used the art to convey the impression they were restrained while they created spirit phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, 'The Great Illusionists', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illusionists, including [[John Nevil Maskelyne]], worked out how the Davenports did their act and re-created the tricks to debunk the brothers' claims of psychic power. However, the re-creations did not involve overt escape, merely a replication of tricks with the statement that they were accomplished by secret magicians' skills rather than spirits. It took another thirty years before the pure skill of escape began to be displayed as an act in itself. The figure most responsible for making escapology a recognized entertainment was [[Harry Houdini]], who built his career on demonstrating the ability to escape from a huge variety of restraints and difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, 'The Great Illusionists', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Houdini made no secret of the fact that he was an expert on restraints and the skills needed to overcome them but he often concealed the exact details of his escapes to maintain an air of mystery and suspense. Although many of his escapes relied on technical skills such as [[lock-picking]] and contortion, he also performed tricks such as [[Metamorphosis (illusion)|Metamorphosis]] and the [[Chinese Water Torture Cell]], which are essentially classic stage illusions reliant on cleverly designed props. Houdini's feats helped to define the basic repertoire of escapology, including escapes from [[handcuffs]], [[padlock]]s, [[straitjacket]]s, [[mail bag]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_-UQ8pUg_4C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Houdini+Mailbag+escape&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4R2ikHM-pZ&amp;sig=DS6KuQR4KzLIYu0qHe5gEBrDPgI&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kJQuUM2KCcf_ygH994DwDg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwDTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Houdini%20Mailbag%20escape&amp;f=false |first1=J.

The actual term 'escapology' is reputed to have been coined originally by Australian escapologist and illusionist Murray (Norman Murray Walters), a Houdini contemporary.

A succession of performers have added new ideas and created variations on old stunts, but it is common for even the best contemporary escapologists to be dubbed modern day "Houdinis".

Because St. [[Nicholas Owen (martyr)|Nicholas Owen]] successfully escaped the [[Tower of London]] and arranged the escape of two [[Jesuit]] inmates from the prison, the 16th-century Christian martyr is considered by [[Catholic]] escapologists as their patron saint. Along with St. John [[Don Bosco]], the two are considered the primary patrons of Catholic [[Gospel Magic]]ians.

==Societies==
The United Kingdom Escape Artists was formed in 2004 and is currently the only organisation in the United Kingdom devoted to the promotion of UK escape artists and the preservation of escapology within the UK. Its members are made up of professional escapologists, restraint collectors, master locksmiths, and historians. The UKEA meet once a year for their AGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedkingdomescapeartists.co.uk ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411091854/http://www.unitedkingdomescapeartists.co.uk/ |date=2013-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Escapologists Society is an online society with its own monthly newsletter that is dedicated to the art of escape on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiesociety.webs.com/ |title=Home - T.I.E.S |website=Tiesociety.webs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escape Masters (The International Association of Escape Artists) was formed in 1985 by renowned escape artist Norman Bigelow and has been run by Thomas Blacke as International President of the organization and Editor/Publisher of the magazine since 2001.

==Forms of escape performance==
*'''Hidden''' is a style of escape performance popularised by the late [[Harry Houdini]] that involved much of the performance taking place behind some form of screen or inside a cabinet in order to protect the secrets of the performer. This style of escape performance was popular with the majority of escape artists until the end of the 20th Century and is still preferred by many performers today. Its disadvantage is that audiences may wrongly believe a concealed assistant to have released the escapologist, whom they may not have seen struggle.
*'''Full View''' is a form of escape performance that was popularised by [[Norman Bigelow]] Sr. during the 1970s. He presented his escapes as pure tests of human skill and endurance and the audience could actually see everything from start to finish. His signature escape, "The Doors Of Death," inspired many escape artists to adopt this style of performance in their own shows.  One performer, Jonathon Bryce, took the full view approach to the Buried Alive escape and with the encouragement of Norman Bigelow Sr., made the world debut of Buried Alive in Full View at the Music is Art Festival in Buffalo, NY with the help of Goo Goo Dolls bassist, Robby Takac. Mark Nelson, "The Great Markini" also performed Full View with his Electrified Mummy Lid Torture Board Escape. 
*'''Escape Or Die,''' the form of escape performance originated by Houdini, is the standard for top-of-the-line escapologists. There are at least three possible ways for an escapologist's life to be at risk from the possible failure of this escape. These are '''death by drowning,''' as in the water escapes Houdini pioneered; '''death by suffocation,''' as in escapes from airtight enclosures containing no water, such as coffins; and '''death by falling,''' as also originated by Houdini, in a straitjacket escape hanging high above the earth as when Houdini hung from cranes and buildings upside down in a strait jacket where falling would mean certain death. UK escape artist [[Alan Alan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/burning-rope-escapologist |title=Burning Rope Escapologist - British Pathé |website=Britishpathe.com |date=2014-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; took this further by hanging from a burning rope hundreds of feet in the air. This type of escapology does fail, and its failures have resulted in escape artists getting hurt or losing their lives.  Others who have done this type of escape include [[Dorothy Dietrich]], [[Antony Britton]], Jonathon Bryce, and Mark Nelson "Markini The Worlds Youngest Professional Escape Artist" highlighted '''death by electrocution''' with his "Electrified Mummy Lid Torture Board". Escape was required in under 60 seconds or a fatal charge of electricity would be passed through the chains holding him to the board.
*'''Occult Escapology''' is a new style of escapology combining escapology with occult magick so that the escape is part of an occult ritual. This makes occult escapology a multidisciplinary subject needing skills in both areas. This style of escapology ranges on a continuum where at one extreme the occultism is the main focus (and consequently, simpler items may be utilized), whereas at the other end the element of escape predominates; however, aspects of both occultism and escapology are simultaneously present, not exclusively one or the other. This style was invented by occultist, author and occult escapologist [[S Rob]]. At the time of writing three of the books written by [[S Rob]] on occult escapology are at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.   
In 2012, Lucas Wilson, an illusionist from Canada managed the fastest ever recorded escape from a straitjacket while suspended; he escaped in 8.4 seconds while hanging upside down from his ankles at a height of 1m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|page=89|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
*''[[The Grim Game]],'' a [[1919 in film|1919 film]], stars [[Harry Houdini]] as a young man who is bound and imprisoned on numerous occasions by a gang who have kidnapped his fiancée. Considered by many as Houdini's best film. Lost for over 90 years and rediscovered in 2015 by escape artist and magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].
*''Haldane of the Secret Service'' a 1924 film, Directed by and Starring [[Harry Houdini]], who is repeatedly restrained by villains who murdered his detective-father. Filmed at Beaver Kill Falls in [[Valatie]], NY.
*The novel ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay]],'' written by [[Michael Chabon]] and winner of the 2001 [[Pulitzer Prize]], features escapology as an important plot point.
*''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]],'' by [[E.L. Doctorow]], features [[Harry Houdini]] as a major character, and uses escapology as a metaphor for the struggles faced by the American immigrant.
*In American [[superhero]] [[comic book]]s, many superheroes like [[Batman]] are trained in escapology, which is invaluable when dealing with [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]]. However,  superheroes who are escapologists by profession include [[Mister Miracle]], [[Justice Machine|Ms. Liberty]] and [[The Escapist (character)|The Escapist]]. (Mister Miracle and The Escapist were both based on escapologist-turned-comic artist [[Jim Steranko]].) Houdini himself appeared as a time/space traveler in the comic book series ''Daring Escapes featuring Houdini.''
*The 1953 biographical film, ''[[Houdini (film)|Houdini]],'' starring [[Tony Curtis]] in the title role, depicted many of Houdini's escapology performances.  Curtis' performance artist character, The Great Leslie, also performs a suspended straight-jacket escape at the start of the film [[The Great Race]].
*In 1971, [[Christopher George]] played an escape artist named Cameron Steele in the TV movie/unsold series pilot, ''[[Escape (1971 film)|Escape]].'' Steele was a non-performing escapologist and night-club owner who, like [[Bill Bixby]]'s Anthony Blake (''[[The Magician (U.S. TV series)|The Magician]]''), habitually helped people in trouble.
*In 1982, [[Griffin O'Neal]] played a junior escapologist named Danny Masters in the film, ''The Escape Artist.''
*In 1983, real-life escape artist Bill Shirk played himself in a film called ''The Escapist.''
*Yorick, the main character of the comic book ''[[Y: The Last Man]],'' is an escape artist.
*In the 1991 film, ''[[The Linguini Incident]],'' [[Rosanna Arquette]] plays an aspiring escape artist.
*The novels ''[[Specific Gravity]]'' and ''[[Ontario Lacus]]'' by J. Matthew Neal (2007 and 2008) features a scientist who is also a master escape artist.
*[[Paul Adam (English novelist)|Paul Adam]]'s ''[[Escape from Shadow Island]],'' first published in 2009, features young escapologist [[Max Cassidy]]. Two further books in the series, ''[[Jaws of Death]]'' and ''[[Dead Man's Bay]],'' will be released in April 2011{{update after|2011|04|30}} and 2012 respectively.
*Adam Phillips's essay "[[Houdini's Box]]" uses Houdini himself, as well as a young victim of sexual abuse and other examples, to discuss escapology.
*The console video game [[EXIT (video game)|Exit]] focuses around the exploits of the self-proclaimed escapologist known as Mr. ESC.
*In the 2013 film, ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', [[Isla Fisher]] plays an escape artist named Henley Reeves. In an interview, she says, "I watched all of Houdini’s work and [[Dorothy Dietrich]], who is a female escapologist, who is amazing, you have to watch her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://collider.com/isla-fisher-now-you-see-me-interview/ |title=Isla Fisher Talks NOW YOU SEE ME, escapist tricks, the cast, and THE GREAT GATSBY |publisher=Collider |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I got to train with Dorothy Dietrich, the first lady magician to catch a bullet with her teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021005059_islafisherxml.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095646/http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021005059_islafisherxml.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher studied the life and work of Dietrich to prepare for the role. "Dorothy is a real female escapologist who is working today. She was the first woman to capture a bullet between her teeth, which is an amazing feat. She's not only good at misdirection, but she also connects emotionally with the audience, so she's better able to involve them in the stunts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coveringmedia.com/movie/2013/05/now-you-see-me.html |title=Now You See Me (2013) |publisher=Covering Media |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels and future of franchise===
While ''Charro Negro'' has been rumored to be the last film in the franchise, director Alberto Rodríguez has stated the possibility of a new film, due to the amount of potential and "many more doors to explore", but would require the creation of new characters.&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"&gt;{{cite news|title=EL CHARRO NEGRO, ¿LA ÚLTIMA LEYENDA?|url=https://videocine.com.mx/noticia/charro-negro-la-ultima-leyenda/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Videocine Distrbucion Noticas|publisher=Televisa, S.A. de C.V.|date=2018}} In Spanish. (Note: date not shown on website)&lt;/ref&gt;
Andrés Couturier, the voice of Don Andrés and manager at [[Ánima Estudios]], said that he wouldn't be "surprised to see crossovers or spin-offs of ''Las Leyendas''."&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"/&gt; Rodríguez stated that ''Charro Negro'' would be his last film, as he has expressed interest in making new projects outside of the franchise. "I feel that my cycle is already finished in terms of [''Leyendas'']. I already want to do other things, but we are still involved in the development of other things that come for the ''Leyendas''," he said.&lt;ref name="proceso-charro-negro"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10304">A '''media franchise''', also known as '''multimedia franchise''', is a collection of related [[Media (communication)|media]] in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work, such as a [[film]], a work of [[literature]], a [[television program]] or a [[video game]]. The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for [[merchandising]] purposes.

A media franchise often consists of [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and can create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers ([[fandom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jaylemke.squarespace.com/storage/Games-Franchises-CulturalOrder-2005.pdf | title=Critical Analysis across Media: Games, Franchises, and the New Cultural Order | publisher=First International Conference on CDA | date=2004 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Lemke, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4#.UjcTWD-9H-s | title=The Culture and Business of Cross-Media Productions | author=Aarseth, Espen | journal=Popular Communication: the International Journal of Media and Culture | year=2006 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=203 | doi=10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Idol]] was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] signing with [[RCA Records]] and having the release of ''[[A Moment Like This]]'' becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100.&lt;ref name=ai&gt;{{cite book | title=Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide | publisher=NYU Press | author=Jenkins, Henry | year=2006 | page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an ''American Idol'' book that made the bestseller list and the film ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]''.&lt;ref name=ai /&gt; A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term "media franchise." The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' book series]] that was adapted into the five films of ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bitten by Twilight: Youth Culture, Media, and the Vampire Franchise | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | author=Click, Melissa | year=2010 | page=12 | isbn=978-1433108945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including '''metaseries'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which can be used to describe works such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;Palumbo, Donald. "Asimov's Crusade Against Bigotry: The Persistence Of Prejudice as a Fractal Motif in the Robot/Empire Foundation Metaseries." JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS 10 (1998): 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, "[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:

{{quote|"In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, [[The Wachowskis|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], creators of ''[[The Matrix trilogy]]'', produced the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie's actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by [[Michel Ancel]] and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars films'' (1999–2005); all five ''[[Harry Potter films]]'' (2001–2008); all three ''[[Spider-Man films]]'' (2002–2007); ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007); and ''[[Transformers]]'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises"|source=Harry Brown, ''Videogames and Education''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Development to other forms==
===Fiction===
Long-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include [[Andy Hardy]], [[Ma and Pa Kettle]], [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Superman]], [[Tarzan]], and [[Batman]]. The longest-running modern film franchises include [[James Bond]], [[Godzilla]], ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.

Media franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as [[Nancy Drew]], [[Miss Marple]], and other popular [[detective]]s, as well as popular [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in [[novel]]s, particularly those in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into [[animated television series]], video games, or both.

A media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' or the [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|''National Lampoon'' series]], and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/how-to-kill-a-major-media-franchise-in-a-decade | title=How To Kill A Major Media Franchise In A Decade | publisher=Buzzfeed | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Bernstein, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Non-fiction]] literary franchises include the ''[[...For Dummies]]'' and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]'' [[reference book]]s. An enduring and extensive example of a media franchise is [[Playboy Enterprises]], which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, ''[[Playboy]]'', within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (''Playboy's Penthouse'', in 1959), and even its own [[Playboy TV|television channel]]. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, [[Playboy Radio|a radio show]], [[direct to video]] films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performing arts center/centre''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]), often abbreviated as PAC, is used to refer to: 

* A multi-use performance space that is intended for use by various types of the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]]. 

:The intended multiple use of performing arts centers in this sense differentiates them from single-purpose [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], [[opera house]]s or [[theater (structure)|theatres]], although the actual use of single-purpose spaces for other than their intended use is widespread. This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman [[Colosseum]] and Greek amphitheatres.

* A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as [[orchestra|symphonic music]] or [[chamber music]] or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole. The modern version of this came into being only in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Steven A.|title=The evolution of the performing arts center|url=http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|publisher=AMS Planning &amp; Research Corp|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=October 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114201139/http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:Examples of this type of PAC are the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Sydney Opera House]], and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York City.

Some performing arts center organizations act as sole presenter for events using the venues within the center, but most also frequently rent their performance spaces to other [[performing arts presenters]] or self-presenting performing arts groups. Examples of this practice is the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] renting venues in Boston's [[Boch Center]].

New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses. PACs became a draw for touring shows and eventually included visual art in their facilities. Today, these centers are valuable civic resources that provide education, access, exchange of creative discourse, opportunities for cultural expression and awareness.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A '''promotional model''' is a [[Model (person)|model]] hired to drive [[demand|consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential customers. A majority of promotional models typically tend to be conventionally attractive in physical appearance. They serve to make a product or service more appealing and can provide information to journalists and consumers at trade show and convention events.

==Practice==
[[File:LotusLady2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A model at the 2009 F1 &amp; World Supercar Show in [[Kwangju]], South Korea]]

This form of [[marketing]] touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]], but the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company, is often more affected by a live person-to-person experience. While each model may not be directly employed by the company they represent, they can be trained to answer questions and provide customer feedback regarding products, services, and brand appeal. The responsibilities of the promotional model depend on the particular marketing campaign being carried out, and may include: increasing product awareness; providing product information; creating an association in the consumer's mind between the product or brand and a particular idea; handing items to consumers, such as a sample of the product itself, a small gift, or printed information. Marketing campaigns that make use of promotional models may take place in retail stores or shopping malls, at [[trade show]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often planned at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.

The motorsports scene refers to promo models as '''race queens'''. In Japan, they are known as '''image models''' and are hired by government agencies.&lt;ref name=vb&gt;{{cite news | last = Feit | first = Daniel |title=E3 2010: In defense of booth babes |url= https://venturebeat.com/2010/06/21/e3-in-defense-of-babes/|publisher=Venturebeat &amp;#124; GamesBeat |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spokesmodel===

"Spokesmodel" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] or product in [[advertisement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spokesmodel |title=Spokesmodel &amp;#124; Define Spokesmodel at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate= 18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spokesmodel |title=Spokesmodel &amp;#124; Definition of spokesmodel by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a "[[brand ambassador]]", who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of such spokesmodels are the models engaged to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999, and the [[Clarion Girl]] since 1975. Contrary to what the term suggests, a spokesmodel is normally not expected to verbally promote the brand. {{clear left}}

===Trade show model===

A '''trade show model''' (also known as a '''convention model''',&lt;ref name=mash/&gt; '''trade show hostess''',&lt;ref name=mash/&gt; '''booth companion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ashcraft | first = Brian |title = How China's biggest expo polices booth babes |url= https://kotaku.com/5931163/how-chinas-biggest-expo-polices-booth-babes |work=Kotaku | location = Australia |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''booth professional''';&lt;ref name=jal&gt;{{cite news| last = Hardigree | first = Matt |url=http://jalopnik.com/5863887/new-york-times-adopts-jalopnik-coined-term-booth-professional | title = ''New York Times'' adopts ''Jalopnik''-coined term "Booth Professional" |work=Jalopnik | publisher = Gawker Media |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that has been used only in Japan is '''companion lady'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = babes, beautiful babes | work = Arcade | issue = #1 | date = December 1998 | page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today more often used is '''event companion''' &lt;small&gt;(イベントコンパニオン)&lt;/small&gt;) is an assistant that works with a company's sales representatives at a trade show exhibit, working on the floor space or a booth, and representing a company to attendees. Such models are used to draw in attendees and can provide them with basic information about product or services, and may be used to distribute marketing materials or gather customer information for future promotions. Attire varies and depends on the nature of the show and on the image the company would like to portray, and they sometimes wear wardrobe that is particular to the company, product, or service represented. 

Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are hired as they make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. If needed, they can explain or disseminate information on the company and its product and service, and can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, therefore increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show. The models can be skilled at drawing attendees into the booth, engaging them in conversation, and at spurring interest in the product, service, or company.

After a round of talks with broadcasters, the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] announced on 27 January 2018 that it would discontinue the use of '''walk-on girls''' in darts tournaments. The decision has encountered a backlash from some fans, players and models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Staff writer |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/darts/42841620 |title=Darts: PDC to scrap walk-on girls after broadcaster talks |work=BBC Sport |date=27 January 2018 |accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 31 January 2018, [[Formula 1]] management announced that it would end the practice of '''grid girls''' (also known as '''paddock girls''' or '''umbrella girls'''), who accompany the racers to the track, a tradition that "has been a staple of Formula 1 Grands Prix for decades", stating that "[they] feel this custom does not resonate with [their] brand values and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = de Menezes | first = Jack |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/formula1/formula-1-f1-grid-girls-banned-get-rid-women-grand-prix-darts-ban-pdc-walk-on-eddie-hearn-a8187161.html |title=Formula 1 to get rid of grid girls before grand prixs in response to darts ban |work=The Independent |date=31 January 2018 |accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move has drawn criticism from former grid girls, including British model [[Kelly Brook]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">{{about|the literary term|the album by Deep Purple|Purple Passages}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''purple prose'' is derived from a reference by the Roman poet [[Horace]]&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nixon |first=Cheryl |title=Novel Definitions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTY6q_hIa90C&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=19 May 2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=9781770482074 |pages=194– |date=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrone1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macrone|first=Michael|title=It's Greek to Me |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ohlxXHpEK8C&amp;pg=PA147 |accessdate=19 May 2013 |date=1994-05-18 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780062720443 |pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65–8 BC) who wrote in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 14–21):&lt;ref name="horace"&gt;Horace (18 BC).

'''''Rainbow Brite''''', also known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Magical Girl Rainbow Brite'''''|魔法少女レインボーブライト|Mahō Shōjo Reinbō Buraito}}, is a media franchise by [[Hallmark Cards]], introduced in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/rainbow-brite-2014-reboot-5-things-know-about-original-nov-6-premiere-video-1705633|title='Rainbow Brite' 2014 Reboot: 5 Things To Know About The Original Before The Nov. 6 Premiere [VIDEO]|date=15 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/rainbow-brite-returns-comic-series/|title='80s Sensation Rainbow Brite Returns In an All-New Comic Series|date=17 July 2018|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated television series of the [[Rainbow Brite (1984 TV series)|same name]] first aired in 1984, the same year Hallmark licensed Rainbow Brite to [[Mattel]] for a range of dolls and other merchandise. A theatrical feature-length film, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The franchise was rebooted in 1996, 2003, 2009, and then again in 2014 through Hallmark's online on-demand streaming video service, [[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/15/showbiz/tv/rainbow-brite-returns-feeln/index.html|title=The return of 'Rainbow Brite'|first=Breeanna Hare,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A line of new merchandise sold only by Hallmark online and in its shops debuted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kenyth-mogan/the-colorful-history-of-r_b_10345612.html|title=The Colorful History Of Rainbow Brite™|first=Kenyth|last=Mogan|date=26 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/40852-rainbow-brite-lights-up-comic-books-once-again.html|title=RAINBOW BRITE Lights Up Comic Books Once Again|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Creation and development of Rainbow Brite for [[Hallmark Cards]] is credited to both Hallmark's Vice President of
Creative/Licensing, Garry Glissmeyer, a team of artists headed by Cheryl Cozad, and writers under the direction of Hallmark's Editorial Director, Dan Drake. Hallmark's Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Lanny Julian, assembled a team of legal, marketing, and public relations associates for this new licensing division.

Glissmeyer and Julian were tasked with breaking Hallmark into the licensing business with the creation of characters targeted at children. Glissmeyer's group's concept of a young girl with powers over nature evolved into her being responsible for all of the colors of the universe. Once the concept was agreed to, Cozad's and Drake's teams developed the backstory and characters needed to support it. Jim McDowell, a key player from Hallmark's marketing unit, conceptualized a strategy to get the new brand in the public eye.

Julian chose [[Mattel]] as the manufacturer and distributor for the line of dolls and toys to follow. Julian chose [[DIC Entertainment]] of France as the studio to provide the brand with episodic animation for television. Glissmeyer placed Cozad in charge of the in-house creative group, to work with Mattel and other licensees. Glissmeyer and Drake continued with creative input, working with DIC on the animation development.

While Hallmark artist, G.G. Santiago, developed the final "look" of Rainbow Brite, Cozad's team finalized style guide models for Rainbow Brite and her friends. Hallmark writer, Mary Loberg, and freelance television writer, Woody Kling, worked with DIC in creating TV storylines for the series, which provided DIC the framework to produce the animation episodes. Kling only worked on three episodes and did not create the Rainbow Brite character or brand as some people believe.

Rainbow Brite made her animated debut in the syndicated prime-time television special, "Peril in the Pits," which was first aired on June 27, 1984. Later, a pair of two-part specials were produced: "The Mighty Monstromurk Menace" and "The Beginning of Rainbowland." A theatrical feature-length film, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1985. These were followed up with eight more episodes for a total of thirteen, which is one season in American television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/rainbow-brite-revival-series-remake-feeln-1201330885/|title=‘Rainbow Brite’ Revival Series Set with Emily Osment and Molly Ringwald|first=Laura|last=Prudom|date=15 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes became part of DIC's weekly syndicated ''[[Kideo TV]]'' block of programming and were rerun in 1987. All were published on [[VHS]] [[videotape]]s in the United States and other countries, along with two live-action programs. One of these was a program intended for use at kids' birthday parties; the other was made on location at the world-famous [[San Diego Zoo]].

Hallmark also created a Rainbow Brite Style Book for companies that wanted to make Rainbow Brite items under license. It gave detailed drawings of all the players and Hallmark's policies on a number of subjects such as the use of its Rainbow Brite logos on the packaging for each product, copyright notices on all products where feasible, fees for creating artwork and the approvals needed before production of new Rainbow Brite merchandise could start.

==Premise==
In Gen 1 continuity, and most of the [[Media franchise|franchise]]'s backstory, a young girl named Wisp is brought to a gray, desolate land with the mission to bring color to this [[Fictional universe|fictional world]] by locating the Sphere of Light. Along the way, she befriends a furry creature (called a sprite) named Twink and a magnificent horse named Starlite and finds a mysterious baby who turns out to be the key to her mission. With the help of her new friends, Wisp locates the legendary Color Belt and rescues the seven Color Kids, who had been trapped by the King of Shadows. Using the Color Belt, Wisp and the Sphere of Light defeat the King of Shadows, liberate the sprites, and bring color and beauty to the land, henceforth called Rainbow Land. Wisp is renamed Rainbow Brite in honor of her new role as leader of the Color Kids, who are together in charge of all the colors in the universe.

The Color Kids spread color across the universe from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid is in charge of their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components to brightening and coloring any object or place. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids' mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other [[villain]]s. Brian, a boy from [[Earth]], sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures.

In the movie, ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'', the setting expands to include the diamond planet, Spectra. All the light in the universe must pass through Spectra before coming to Earth. However, Earth soon falls into a wintry darkness when the diamond-obsessed Dark Princess decides to steal Spectra for her own. Rainbow Brite and her horse, Starlite, must team with Spectra's boy warrior, Krys, and his robotic horse, On-X, to defeat the powers of darkness and save Spectra, Earth, and the universe.

Gen 2 continuity took a radical departure from any other generation's story, focusing as much on [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] as the colors of the rainbow. Rainbow Brite had an entirely new and smaller group of friends called the Color Crew. Despite distribution and marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, the toy line never reached the success of its predecessor and ended after little more than a year.

Gen 3 was basically a relaunch of Gen 1 in 2003, with the same story, but a smaller range of characters produced. The dolls from Toy Play were similar to but not exact copies of the Gen 1 versions. There was also a sizable amount of Rainbow Brite merchandise from various other manufacturers just as in Gen 1.

Gen 4A celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Rainbow Brite in 2009 with continuity returning the setting again to Rainbow Land, which looked nothing like the original version. This time, Rainbow Brite and her friends' mission was to bring hope and happiness to the far corners of the universe, making hearts lighter and worlds a little more colorful along the way. The story focuses on Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow, each representing one of Rainbow Land's Sky Powers, which determine the cycles of the days and seasons. Gen 4 continuity makes Rainbow Brite a girl originally from Earth (Return to Rainbow Land). Rainbow Brite's absence from the world is explained in a story that sees Rainbow return to her home on Earth for a brief visit with her family after many adventures spreading color throughout Rainbow Land and the universe. But when the Dark Princess erases Rainbow Land from Rainbow Brite's memory while on Earth, she never returns to her duties in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite eventually returns to Rainbow Land with the help of Starlite and Puppy Brite. Playmates' line of toys was very controversial among fans and consumers largely because of the change in Rainbow Brite's age from about 6 or 7 years old, to 10 or 11. These dolls had a more mature fashion doll-like design, which was totally unlike all of the previous dolls in the series. The three girl dolls were wearing [[training bra]]s and [[panties]] under their clothes. The line suffered a delay, which caused the toys to not be available until after the holiday season that year. It saw scarce distribution as retailers were not impressed with it and was canceled after just seven months and before the first release was completed.

[[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]]'s (part of Hallmark) Gen 4B animated reboot retained most Gen 1 story elements and recognizable but not identical character designs. It introduced a few new story elements, one being the Sentinels of Light, which included Rainbow Brite as a guardian of light and color and Krys as the protector of light unseen. Stormy also played a more prominent role. After a falling out with her pal, Rainbow Brite, Stormy joined the forces of darkness and became a formidable [[frenemy]]. As the Dark Princess's manipulations became more transparent, Stormy started questioning where her true loyalties lay and returned to Rainbow Land as Rainbow Brite's friend. Gen 4B consisted solely of web content from Hallmark and only resulted in a minuscule amount of give-away merchandise. None of the items were available for purchase.

Gen 5 began in 2015 with dolls and toys very similar to those of Gens 1 and 3. Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, distribution and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark's Itty Bittys plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink &amp; Starlite plushes, a 16" Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women's clothing, and an expansion of the Itty Bittys line. More Rainbow Brite merchandise was introduced in 2016 and even more is expected in 2017. In the fall of 2016, Hallmark finally gave Rainbow Brite fans what they had been waiting for since the 1980s; a Stormy doll with her own horse. New books were released at the same time but the Gen 5 line is still small when compared to Gen 1.

==Merchandise==

===First Generation: Mattel===
For the first Rainbow Brite generation (1984–1987), [[Mattel]] produced the dolls and many of the toys along with a large line of school supplies only sold in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2623061027|title=Transformers, Rainbow Brite top Christmas toys of 1984|date=31 December 1969|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Rainbow Brite licensed merchandise was produced by various companies. This included many story and activity books by [[Western Publishing]] ([[Little Golden Books]]), a number of puzzles, a line of costume jewelry, banks and suitcases by Kat's Meow, clothes, toys, games, doll and child furniture, radios, child cosmetics, linen, towels, personal care items, lamps, figurines, VHS videocassettes, audio cassettes, records, bicycles, bedding, curtains and much more sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The rest of Europe saw a smaller variety of merchandise, though this varied from country to country.

For example, the entire Mattel line was not sold in all countries. Italy and Spain did not receive the second release of dolls (Lala Orange, Buddy Blue &amp; Shy Violet), the Dress Up line or Kitty Brite. Many Mattel items were made in Europe by local suppliers for the local markets. A French toymaker produced Rainbow Brite, Murky Dismal and Lurky in Mattel packaging in France during 1984 and 1985. An Italian toy company made the European versions of Starlite, the Color Cottage, and the Color Buggy for all of Europe during 1984 and 1985. In both cases, production was switched to Mattel's contract manufacturers in Asia for 1986 and 1987. The entire line of Rainbow Brite for Spain (six dolls, five sprites, Starlite, Lurky and the Color Cottage) was produced in Spain from 1984 until the line ended there in 1986 or 1987. Similarly, this occurred in Mexico with the entire doll line minus the Dress Up dolls. This was the result of high import duties in a number of countries at the time, caused by [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies.

Books, comic books, sticker albums and audio tapes were the best selling licensed items outside the United Kingdom, but other items did exist in different countries. In Germany alone there were no less than thirty-one story cassettes and forty-six comic books. Germany also had an exclusive version of the Dress Up Rainbow Brite doll that included a story cassette. This cassette was not sold separately but was produced by Europa, producer of the other 30 story cassettes. It is unknown if the cassettes were sent to the Asian factory that made the dolls or were put into the dolls' boxes in Germany. A line of five 3D erasers in the form of various Rainbow Brite characters was sold in Europe with Mattel branding, while the same line was also sold in Australia under the name of Harveston Super Action figures with the addition of an additional character (Lurky) not sold in Europe. A number of Gen 1B (the second release of the first generation) dolls made for the American and Mexican markets ended up being sold in Germany because of strong demand there. These dolls had their English or Spanish names covered by a sticker with the German name or sometimes nothing at all. Two Rainbow Brite dolls plus Twink and Starlite were also produced in Brazil by Estrella. These were not exported anywhere and came in their own unique white packaging with all writing less the Rainbow Brite name in the Brazilian version of Portuguese. Because of Rainbow Brite's extreme popularity soon after she was launched, a number of other companies not related to Mattel produced many unlicensed lookalike (fake or bootleg) items that were sold in North America and Europe.

The Mattel line of toys and dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those that came with the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wallhangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 different items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the 'Emotions' line. The Emotions line included five dolls including a 15" Buddy Blue doll, that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, the Emotions dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but the Emotions horse was smaller than the normal version. As such the Emotions dolls were neither in scale with the Emotions horse or the regular Mattel version. And of course the Emotions dolls were too big to sit on the Emotions horse or the normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and the Emotions line was never sold outside the United States and Canada.

Mattel's Dress Up line of dolls and horses is the most sought after part of the entire Mattel line, particularly Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy's doll was shown in the Mattel catalog and on the backs of the Dress Up doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in some cartoon episodes and several German comic books. There was also a line of cataloged clothing for the Dress Up dolls, but like Stormy, it was never produced. The two horses, Starlight and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were in fact from Mattel's line of 'Barbie' merchandise. The Dress Up line was only made for about one year. That makes the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite Dress Up dolls are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line.

Televised commercials for Mattel's Rainbow Brite dolls frequently featured the song, "[[Over the Rainbow]]," from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]], often with altered lyrics or arrangements. Child actors [[Tracey Gold]], [[Kellie Martin]] and [[Heather O'Rourke]], famous for their roles in 1980s television and film, also appeared.

===Second Generation: Up, Up and Away===
The second Rainbow Brite generation (1996–1997) greatly differed from any generation before or since. It used the Rainbow Brite name but not the same characters or backstory. The master license was held by Up, Up and Away, a company which is no longer in business.

Rainbow Brite no longer had anything do with making colors and was now in charge of diversity. Although this version did have rainbow-colored hair, the characters resembled real-world children more than their previous animated and doll counterparts. In the second generation's story, Rainbow Brite had four friends, called the Color Crew, which included Amber (Latina), Cerise (Asian), Ebony (African) and Indigo (Central Asian, the only character name borrowed from the original Color Kids).

Rainbow Brite was produced as large and small dolls while the Color Crew was represented only in the small doll range. The large Rainbow Brite dolls came with three pots of Color-Glo Paint and a brush, while the small dolls included a single pot of Color-Glo Paint and a brush. The large doll was released in two different boxes, the first lacking a window so buyers could not see the doll inside. As the doll was sold with three different wardrobes, buying one was a gamble regarding which look she would have (unless one read the small code box on the bottom of the package indicating the doll's shoe color). The large doll later came in a window box with a simplified single wardrobe. The small dolls came boxed at first and then blister carded on two different types of cards. They are noted for being the only Rainbow Brite dolls ever produced with Dutch text on the packaging.

The Canadian importer was Irvine, a company which is currently still in business, and their product packaging was printed in both French and English texts. [[Ideal Toy Company]] was the importer for most of [[Western Europe]], though Euro Play imported the line for Germany. The large doll was also distributed in Italy by GiG with only Italian text on the box. There were no other toys or accessories for the second generation dolls other than additional pots of Color-Glo Paint, which were sold in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. There was also a version of at least the large doll in a box with Spanish-only text. Another 15" Rainbow Brite doll with a Color Glo Bear and paint set was prototyped, as was a black version, which was produced in very small numbers. But only the black version was ever produced and then in very limited numbers. There was a Gen 2B which had simplified packaging and outfits as an effort to keep the line going by cutting costs. The second generation had nowhere near the success the first generation had at retail and was discontinued after less than two years on the market. 
===Third Generation: Toy Play===
The third Rainbow Brite generation (2003–2005) was also the 20th Anniversary Release. The master toy licensee was Toy Play, a defunct subsidiary of The Betesh Group. The parent company is still in business. [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] was the [[television network]] that advertised the line. [[Hot Topic]] was the lead merchandiser with a unique Rainbow Brite doll not manufactured by Toy Play and many items of women's clothing, accessories and stationary.

Without being an exact copy of the originals, this generation returned to the look and feel of the Mattel line even if the product line was much narrower than the first generation. Toy Play followed the first generation's character roll out, producing Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Canary Yellow and Patty O'Green characters but no more Color Kids followed. Starlite, Puppy Brite and the Sprites were also represented in various merchandise.

Characters were produced in different sizes, from three to twenty-eight inches tall across the line which went from PVC plastic figurines to plush dolls. Toy Play produced both retro-style plush dolls with wiring in their limbs to make them poseable along with plastic dolls wearing soft clothing and having articulated arms and legs. Some dolls were sold with a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1 DVD]] in English featuring a single episode of the original cartoon. Some Toy Play products were sold in Canada with English-French packaging. Toy Play's 18 inch talking Rainbow Brite doll notoriously omitted the color green when 'speaking' all of the colors of the rainbow. Toy Play indicated that the missing color would be added for future production runs, but this never happened because the line died out before a corrected version appeared.

Toy Play was the first (and so far only) merchandiser to produce a Color Castle playset, the Light Up Musical Castle, which included small articulated figurines of Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Twink and Puppy Brite. The playset's box showed pictures of forthcoming product (a Rainbow Brite and Friends Sprites' village playset, an in-scale Starlite with brushable mane, as well as figurine 2-packs to include Rainbow Brite and Twink, Red Butler and Romeo, Patty O'Green and Lucky, Canary Yellow and Spark, and Murky Dismal and Lurky) though these were never produced. There was also a wide range of other merchandise, mostly clothing, that was available during Gen 3. For some unknown reason, the orange-colored tags and logos that started with Gen 3 have been revived for Gen 5.  

===Fourth Generation: Playmates Toys===
The fourth Rainbow Brite generation (2009–2010) was the 25th anniversary release and was accompanied by a series of web-episodes produced by [[Animax Entertainment]] that were available to stream on www.RainbowBrite.com., which no longer exists. The master toy license belonged to [[Playmates Toys]] and their line of Rainbow Brite toys was expected to be in stores in the fall of 2009. Production delays saw the line actually debut in stores on December 24 of that year, which of course missed the 2009 [[Christmas and holiday season#Shopping|holiday shopping season]].

This interpretation of Rainbow Brite was controversial among fans of the original Rainbow Brite as the characters, though still youthful in appearance, appeared significantly older and were styled more like traditional 11" [[fashion doll]]s. The line's initial product release only included three plastic fashion dolls (Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow) and three plastic horses with rooted manes (Starlite, Sunriser, and Shimmer). A larger 15" Rainbow Brite doll was also produced. The line initially omitted the Color Kids altogether in favor of a more sky-power oriented storyline. The packaging art hinted at a possible Stormy doll to come, though yet again she never arrived.

The Playmates' line never caught on with its target audience. After missing its holiday season window and facing controversy within the fandom, the Playmates' Rainbow Brite line withered on the vine and died. Most retailers refused to carry the line and those that did saw stock run out by July 2010. If any reorders were placed, they were not in quantities that justified continued production. The line was only on the market for about seven months and was not available in all of the [[Contiguous United States]].

In the Fall of 2010 three Sprite dolls appeared at retail in Mexico. These included Twinkle (a renamed Twink) for Rainbow Brite, Nite Sprite for Moonglow and Twilite for Tickled Pink. These were already in production when US retailers dropped the line. The fourth generation saw a number of licensed products similar to the third generation, some in the original Gen 1 style and some in the new Gen 4 style. This included mostly clothing and stationary, plus a small bicycle. The final products during the fourth generation came from Madame Alexander, and included a traditional Madame Alexander-style Gen 1 Rainbow Brite doll with Twink, as well as Gen 4-style plush dolls of Rainbow Brite and Tickled Pink.  
===Feeln===
A three-part animated [[miniseries]] was launched on November 6, 2014 by Video On Demand site [[Hallmark Movies Now|Feeln]]. The reboot showcased updated character designs for the cast, and starred [[Emily Osment]] as the voice of Rainbow Brite and [[Molly Ringwald]] as the voice of Dark Princess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/emily-osment-molly-ringwald-voice-740667|title=Emily Osment, Molly Ringwald Voice New 'Rainbow Brite' Series|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second episode was shown on November 13, 2014 and the series concluded on November 20, 2014. Feeln's miniseries was well received by many in the Rainbow Brite fandom but it did not produce any merchandise. As such, it has not been given a generation number but is sometimes called Gen 4A because it arrived before the Gen 4 dolls and horses arrived in the shops near the end of the following month and is sometimes called Gen 4B. Although a Starlite Pillow Pal was produced by Pillow Pets during this time, it was actually not part of the Playmates line of toys.

===Fifth Generation: Hallmark Toys===
Hallmark introduced the fifth generation of Rainbow Brite toys, along with clothing and other merchandise in July 2015. A limited edition line of Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys featuring Rainbow Brite, Twink, Champ, O.J., Lucky and I.Q. arrived first, each produced in limited quantities of 500 units. These sold out in five days on hallmark.com, and the demand led to Hallmark reissuing the Itty Bittys with slightly revised designs in much greater numbers along with the first Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys boxed set featuring Red Butler, Romeo, Indigo and Hammy. These items were followed by an 8" Twink plush and 11" Starlite plush in September 2015, as well as a 16" Rainbow Brite doll that November.

In 2016 Hallmark released another Itty Bitty boxed set featuring Patty O'Green, Buddy Blue, Lucky &amp; Champ. A 24" Rainbow Brite Jumbo Itty Bitty arrived in December. A limited edition Shy Violet Itty Bitty was released as a Hallmark online exclusive that Summer. In Fall of 2016 many new Rainbow Brite items were available at Hallmark stores and online, including several new story and activity books, a new range of greeting cards, and a 1,000 piece Rainbow Land puzzle. A Starlite Itty Bitty was released in November, as well as 11" Sunriser and Skydancer plushes, and for the first time ever a 16" Stormy doll. Packaging for the single items consists only of attached tags with the product name, Hallmark logo, copyright notice and barcode, while the boxed sets feature Rainbow Land displayable backgrounds. These toys are currently sold only in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Hallmark Keepsake Rainbow Brite holiday ornaments were sold in 2015 (a reissue of Hallmark's 2013 ornament) and 2016.


==Non-English names==
Rainbow Brite had a number of names in other languages even if the Rainbow Brite name was on all of the packaging for all markets. In Canadian French she was called Azurine, from the azure color of her dress. In European French she was called Blondine au Pays de l'Arc-en-Ciel (The Blonde Girl from the Land of the Rainbow) or just Blondine for short. In German speaking countries and regions, she was called Regina Regenbogen (Regina Rainbow). In Italy she was called Iridella which came from her iridescent dress. In both Spanish and Portuguese speaking markets she was called Arco Iris (also Rainbow). In Spain, she was also called Rubita (a diminutive for Blonde). The other characters in the Rainbow Brite universe also had language-specific names. The French names for everyone in Rainbow Land in Canadian French were different than the names used in European French. In Dutch-speaking areas, the English names were used.

[[Image:RollerGames logo.png|right|200px]]
[[Image:World Alliance of Rollersports logo.png|right|150px|thumb|'''World Alliance of Rollersports''' (fictional league for ''RollerGames'')]]

'''''RollerGames''''' was a U.S. television series that presented a theatrical version of the sport of [[roller derby]] for a national audience, and featured a number of skaters who had been in the [[Roller Games]] league (1961–1975), as well as younger participants. It was broadcast for one season (1989–1990).  The series came from the combination of Roller Games owner William Griffiths, Sr. and the television production team of David Sams and [[Mike Miller (TV producer)|Mike Miller]]. 

==Format==
The show took place in the [[Super Roller Dome]], where all matches were broadcast. Instead of a banked oval track, a [[Figure 8 racing|figure eight]] track was used where one side was heavily banked. It included obstacles such as the "Wall of Death" (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the "Jet Jump". The only ones who could score during each 45-second scoring [[Frequency|cycle]] were the "jetters," who wore helmets and got six points if they got above the top line for three steps on the Wall of Death without going over, and two points if they got between the two lines for three steps.  The "Jet Jump" had a 12-foot marker that allowed six points if the jetter got past it, and two if the jetter landed in front of it. In either case, the jetter had to land safely.  Also, there were only four skaters on the track at a time (instead of the usual five). 

The rest of the cycle involved traditional roller derby elements of scoring one point for every opponent lapped.  The players got as many 45-second cycles as possible within four six-minute periods (cut down from eight 12-minute periods in traditional roller derby).  The team with the most points won.  The last cycle went the full 45 seconds regardless of what the period clock said.

The first jetter to legally enter the jetwave won the status of "lead jetter," and could cut off the cycle early by tapping his or her helmet, signaling the referees to call off the cycle.

As a [[tiebreaker]], two skaters would skate around a pit full of [[alligator]]s. The first skater to skate around the pit five times or to throw his or her opponent into the alligator pit was declared the winner.  The debut episode was the only time live alligators were ever used, as no ties ever happened after that (although a "news report" featured another tiebreaker).  The episode revealed one of the rare times that the T-Birds lost the championship, with the Violators taking it (although later footage revealed that Skull, the manager, cheated by interfering, but the Violators got to keep the Commissioner's Cup in spite of that).

Instead of a [[penalty box]], skaters that committed misdemeanors sat in a "penalty pod," one of each was located on either side of the broadcast booth where Sams and Underwood called the action.  Because the rules said there were always four skaters on the track, a jetter got one bonus point each time they passed the skater inside the pod.  Referee [[Don Lastra]] frequently referred to the penalty pod as "jail," and would tell skaters who got a penalty to "go sit down."  (Lastra would also fine players specific amounts of money; these fines were to be paid out of pocket as a check and given to him, since he issued the fines.  Fines usually were issued if the act incurring a penalty came in between a period or after the end of the game, but the players who got fined always said vindication was theirs, and thus a [[moral victory]] was earned).

==Teams ==
The "world famous" [[Los Angeles T-Birds]] were one of the teams used for the show. Other teams were the Rockers, Hot Flash, Violators, Bad Attitude and Maniacs. Many of the athletes that skated for Griffiths in the past were used for ''RollerGames''. (The Hot Flash team was referred as "Hollywood Hot Flash" on a couple of occasions.)  Some of the most visible skaters included twin sisters [[Jennifer Van Galder|Jennifer]] &amp; [[Kristine Van Galder]], the "T-Bird Twins" (two blonde waitresses that Sams recruited while dining at a trendy LA area eatery), "The IceBox" Robert Smith, brothers "Mr. Mean" Harold Jackson &amp; "Monster Man" Bernie Jackson, Michael Flaningam "The California Kid", "Skinney Minnie" Gwen Miller, "Electric" Randi Whitman (who got her nickname because of her hair), "Stars and Stripes" Matt Bickham, "Dar The Star" Darlene Langlois, "Latin Spitfire" Patsy Delgado, "Sweet" Stephanie Garcia, and Rocker Speed Skater and Guitarist on the Roller Games TV Theme Song, Michael "Fish" Fischer (who was forced to leave the team before the first telecast because he broke his hand in practice), and [[Ralphie Valladares]], whose daughter, Gina, skated for Hot Flash. Other past Roller Derby personalities to appear on ''RollerGames'' included "Mizz" [[Georgia Hase]], the cantankerous heel manager of the Detroit Devils and Bad Attitude, and "Little" Richard Brown, the Maniacs' top skater who got to manage and coach several skaters on ''[[RollerJam]]''.

== Storylines ==
Some of the storylines were off-the-wall, but tame by today's standards&amp;nbsp;— the main storyline was a controversy involving the T-Bird Twins being drafted as one person (more on that below), rather than two.  Hair-pulling and catfights were crowd favorites.  When a fight broke out, the cameras frequently cut to a shot of an angry woman in a pink dress, glaring at the skaters.

The show became noted for its "big controversy:" according to a report from Sams, Georgia Hase claimed the T-Bird Twins were improperly drafted as one entity.  Thus, Jennifer went to the Violaters, and Kristine went to the Maniacs. At the same time, the league office informed Ralphie Valladares that he was to be the first inductee into the Hall of Fame.  This led Hase to object that, according to the rule book, Ralphie could not enter unless he hung up his skates for good. The league office did not intend for that to happen.  Hase then decided that Ralphie would never skate again, as well as never go into the Hall of Fame.

After two rule violations by [[John "Guru" Drew]] (manager for the Maniacs) and [[Chuck Skull]] (manager of the Violators) of physically abusing each of the T-Bird twins, Sams and on-the-track commentator [[Shelley Jamison]] brought up how each twin's contract was null and void, thus returning them to the T-Birds.  This led Griffiths, Sr., as commissioner, to let the public decide on how this situation was to go.  The American public overwhelmingly elected that Ralphie continue to skate while being inducted into the Hall of Fame, and that the twins return to the T-Birds for good (viewers in the continental 48 states could vote by calling a 900 number, while Alaska and Hawaii residents had to write a letter to a specific address, as the 900 number was not available to them).  The exact number of votes was 75,468, with 96% voting "YES" and only 4% voting "NO."

Although the show was cancelled after one season, the show also featured an episode where Ralphie challenged the "unholy 3" ("Mizz" Georgia Hase, Guru Drew, Skull) to a 3-on-1 match race. Griffiths, Sr. pointed out that 3-on-1 wasn't legal according to league laws (during an interview with [[Wally George]]), but 2-on-1 was, so Skull had to drop out.  While Ralphie dealt with Georgia and Drew, "Stars and Stripes" Matt Bickham reported to Shelley Jamison that he'd keep an eye on Skull.  Due to the producers' bankruptcy and the show's subsequent cancellation, that match race never took place.  The show also offered the public a chance to dial the same 900 number and vote on whether or not the alligators should be banned from the sport, but due to the cancellation, the viewers never got to see the outcome.

== Production ==
In 1989, television producers David Sams and [[Mike Miller (television)|Mike Miller]] teamed with Roller Games owner Bill Griffiths, Sr. to create a modern version of the sport marketed as ''Rock and RollerGames''. Sams provided color commentary while [[Chuck Underwood]] provided the main play-by-play.

The show also included halftime entertainment by musical performers like [[Lita Ford]], [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]], [[Exposé (band)|Exposé]], and had halftime commentary by [[Wally George]]. Former [[Phoenix, Arizona]] news reporter [[Shelley Jamison|Shelly Jamison]] (who also appeared nude in ''[[Playboy]]'') served as sideline reporter. ''RollerGames'' premiered in 95% of the country, and, though generally panned by critics, was well received among teenagers and college students.{{fact|date=May 2010}}

Director [[Chet Forte]] was recruited to direct the show. Many of the graphics and camera techniques were unique for the day, like the cameras on the skaters.  Additional segments were directed by producer David Sams, [[Joe Dea]] and wrestling director [[Andrew Hecker]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443402/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In many cities, ''RollerGames'' aired late at night, against ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', while in others it aired mid-day on Saturdays. Although the show's ratings were quite good, even beating out ''[[American Gladiators]]'', it only lasted one season before getting cancelled due to some of the producers going [[bankrupt]] (War Productions, Sans-Miller Productions). However, co-producers Motown Productions, and the distributor, [[Qintex| Qintex Productions]] (who also co-produced the Disney Channel's version of ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' for two seasons) did not go bankrupt due to ''RollerGames''.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} RollerGames delivered a 4.7 national rating vs. the ''American Gladiators'' 2.5 rating. Its debut in New York scored a 9.3 overnight rating.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Revivals==
The show paved the way for a revival ten years later with the 1999 premiere of [[Spike TV|The New TNN]]'s ''[[WSL RollerJam]]'', where former ''RollerGames'' skaters Richard Brown, Patsy Delgado and Ray Robles skated.

In January 2008, ''RollerGames'' coproducer David Sams announced that he "intends to put banked-track Roller Sports back on Television and the Internet in 2008."&lt;!--Actual ref is a MySpace blog, but blog.myspace.com is blacklisted on Wikipedia--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17725020&amp;blogID=348468694

He also said "A tour is being planned for the winter/spring of 2009."&lt;!--Actual ref is a MySpace blog, but blog.myspace.com is blacklisted on Wikipedia--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17725020&amp;blogID=371481808|title=Sams Looking For The Best Roller Derby Players In America To Star In PrimeTime TV Series...|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''RollerGames'', Griffiths continued promoting an untelevised league under the name [[Roller Games International]], which continues the sport of ''RollerGames'' to this day.

A '''stock character''' is a [[stereotypical]] fictional [[character (arts)|character]] in a work of art such as a novel, play, film, or a movie whom audiences recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary [[tradition]]. Stock characters are [[archetypal]] characters distinguished by their [[flat character|flatness]]. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for [[parody]] and to be criticized as [[cliché]]s. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many [[genre]]s. The point of the stock character is to move the story along by allowing the audience to already understand the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=stock character | encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Chris Baldick | year=2008 | pages=317 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;vq=%22stock%20character%22&amp;pg=PA317#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stock%20character%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=stock character | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Identity | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Kamesha Jackson | editor=Ronald L. Jackson II | year=2010 | url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageidentity/stock_character/0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and history==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2008}}

===Ancient Greece===
The study of the Character, as it is now known, was conceived by [[Aristotle]]'s student [[Theophrastus]]. In ''The Characters'' (c. 319 BC), Theophrastus introduced the "character sketch", which became the core of "the Character as a genre". It included 30 character types. Each type is said to be an illustration of an individual who represents a group, characterized by his most prominent trait. The Theophrastan types are as follows:
{| border="0"
|-
| valign="top" |
* The Insincere Man 
* The Flatterer 
* The Garrulous Man 
* The Boor 
* The Complacent Man 
* The Man without Moral Feeling 
* The Talkative Man 
* The Fabricator 
* The Shamelessly Greedy Man 
* The Pennypincher
| valign="top" |
* The Offensive Man 
* The Hapless Man 
* The Officious Man 
* The Absent-Minded Man
* The Unsociable Man 
* The Superstitious Man 
* The Faultfinder 
* The Suspicious Man 
* The Repulsive Man 
* The Unpleasant Man 
| valign="top" |
* The Man of Petty Ambition 
* The Stingy Man
* The Show-Off 
* The Arrogant Man
* The Coward 
* The Oligarchical Man 
* The Late Learner 
* The Slanderer
* The Lover of Bad Company 
* The Basely Covetous Man 
|}

It is unclear from where Theophrastus derived these types, but many strongly resemble those from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Despite the fact that Theophrastus sought to portray character types and not individuals, some of the sketches may have been drawn from observations of actual persons in Athenian public life. Although the preface of the work implies the intention to catalogue "human nature, associate[ed] with all sorts and conditions of men and contrast[ed] in minute detail the good and bad among them", many other possible types are left unrepresented. These omissions are especially noticeable because each of the thirty characters represents a negative trait ("the bad"); some scholars have therefore suspected that another half of the work, covering the positive types ("the good"), once existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This preface, however, is certainly fictitious, i.e. added in later times, and cannot therefore be a source of any allegation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nowadays many scholars also believe that the definitions found in the beginning of each sketch are later additions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====New Comedy====
{{Main|Ancient Greek comedy}}
New Comedy was the first theatrical form to have access to Theophrastus' Characters. [[Menander]] was said to be a student of Theophrastus, and has been remembered for his prototypical cooks, merchants, farmers and slave characters. Although we have few extant works of the New Comedy, the titles of Menander's plays alone have a "Theophrastan ring": ''The Fisherman'', ''The Farmer'', ''The Superstitious Man'', ''The Peevish Man'', ''The Promiser'', ''The Heiress'', ''The Priestess'', ''The False Accuser'', ''The Misogynist'', ''The Hated Man'', ''The Shipmaster'', ''The Slave'', ''The Concubine'', ''The Soldiers'', ''The Widow'', and ''The Noise-Shy Man''.

====Mimistry====
Another early form that illustrates the beginnings of the Character is the [[mime artist|mime]]. Greco-Roman mimic playlets often told the stock story of the fat, stupid husband who returned home to find his wife in bed with a lover, stock characters in themselves. Although the mimes were not confined to playing stock characters, the mimus calvus was an early reappearing character. Mimus calvus resembled Maccus, the buffoon from the [[Atellan Farce]]. The Atellan Farce is highly significant in the study of the Character because it contained the first true stock characters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Atellan Farce employed four fool types. In addition to Maccus, Bucco, the glutton, Pappus, the naïve old man (the fool victim), and [[Dossennus]], the cunning hunchback (the trickster). A fifth type, in the form of the additional character Manducus, the chattering jawed pimp, also may have appeared in the Atellan Farce, possibly out of an adaptation of Dossennus. The Roman mime, as well, was a stock fool, closely related to the Atellan fools.

===Roman input===

====Plautus====
The [[Roman Republic|Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]] drew from Atellan Farce as well as the Greek Old and New Comedy. He expanded the four types of Atellan Farce to eight (not quite as distinct as the farcical types):
* Old man, probably a [[miser]] – ''senex iratus''
* Young man in love, possibly the miser's son, who rebels against authority – ''adulescens amator''
* [[Tricky slave|Clever or cunning slave]] – ''servus callidus''
* [[Stupidity|Stupid]] slave – ''servus stultus''
* Hanger-on ([[parasite]]) or [[flattery|flatterer]] – ''parasitus''
* [[Courtesan]] – ''meretrix''
* [[Slave dealer]] or [[pimp]] – ''leno''
* [[Braggart]] [[soldier]] – ''[[Miles Gloriosus]]'' note; Swaggering Soldier

Plautus's fool was either the slave or the parasite.

====Laertius====
In revision of Theophrastus, [[Diogenes Laertius]] published ''Ethical Characters'' (Circa 230 BC), sparking interest in two lines of study.

The first is that of the character book. Imitators of Theophrastus including Satyrus Atheneus, [[Heracleides Ponticus]], [[Lycon (mythology)|Lycon]], and [[Publius Rutilius Lupus|Rutilius Lupus]] wrote their own character sketches. Circa 212 BC, [[Aristo of Ceos|Ariston]]'s discourse on morality included several proud Character types and mimicked the Theophrastan style. Following [[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]]'s work on "Self seeking Affability" and Ariston's characters, evidence of acquaintance with the genre is present, however popularity of the portrait over the generalized stock figures in increasing. This may explain the gap of time from the beginning of the Common Era to the 16th century marked by an absence of character sketching.

The second field is the study of nomenclature. As the Character rose as a literary genre, many terms were coined in attempt to place labels on the new subject. The translation Theophrastus' title is based on the terms ''charassein'' and ''Charakter'', associated with the stamping of an impression. [[Rhetorica ad Herennium]] (c. 20 BC), attributed to [[Cicero]], split the character up into two qualities: ''effictio'', the description of physical appearance, and ''notation'', the nature of man. Later in his [[De Inventione]], Cicero divided the character, or ''conformation'' as he called it, into eleven points: name, nature (''natura''), way of life (''victus''), fortune (''fortuna''), physical appearance (''habitus''), passions (''affectio''), interests (''studium''), reasons for doing things (''consilium''), one's deeds (''factum''), what happens to one (''casus''), one's discourses (''orationes''). [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], too, played a part in providing labels for the new genre in his [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|Epistulae Morale]], using the terms ''ethologia'' and ''characterismos'' for characteristic conduct of moral types. Circa 93 AD, [[Quintilian]]'s [[Institutio Oratoria]] discussed the effect of personality on rhetoric and in so doing, coined the terms ''ethopoeia'', an orator's imitation of another person's character or habits, and [[prosopopoeia]], the same thing, but with a dramatization of the person as well as the giving of his words. Other terms conceived in the period include ''figurae sententiarum'' and ''descriptio personae''. [[Decorum]], the rhetorical principle that an individual's words and subject matter are appropriately matched, also became a relevant term, and would remain significant into the [[Renaissance]].

====Supersession by philosophy====
The Romans' "perverse admiration for decorum"{{Cite quote|date=January 2014}} is in part responsible for the deterioration and the resulting blackout period of the Character genre. During this blackout, the Character smoldered under the philosophies of such men as [[Horace]]. In the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] (c. 18 BC), Horace drew pictures of typical men at various ages, from childhood to old age. Horace's belief that "what is typical of a class should be observable in the individual" was illustrated in his epistles classifying [[Achilles]] as a man of rage and love, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] an impractical lover, and [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] the model of virtue and wisdom. Others, such as [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch|Aphthonius]], and [[Priscian]], shared this belief and sought to explore the workings of human nature.

===Other countries===
Stock characters also feature heavily in the comic traditions of [[Kyōgen]] in Japan and [[Commedia dell'arte]] in Italy; in the latter they are known as ''tipi fissi'' (fixed [human] types).

==Academic analysis==
According to [[Dwight V. Swain]], a creative writing professor and prolific fiction author, all characters begin as stock characters and are fleshed out only as far as needed to advance the plot. &lt;ref&gt;Swain, Dwight V. ''Creating Characters: How to Build Story People'' Writers Digest Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

According to E. Graham McKinley, "there is general agreement on the importance to drama of 'stock' characters. This notion has been considerably explored in film theory, where feminists have argued, female stock characters are only stereotypes (child/woman, whore, &lt;!--Originally cited. Please do not remove it further.--&gt;bitch&lt;!--Originally cited. Please do not remove it further.--&gt;, wife, mother, secretary or girl Friday, career women, vamp, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;E. Graham McKinley, ''Beverly Hills, 90210: television, gender, and identity'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=S4tl1L_NG_cC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22female+stock+characters%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22female%20stock%20characters%22&amp;f=false 19].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the subject of female stock characters has attracted scholarly attention as seen in the work of Ulrike Roesler and Jayandra Soni whose work deals "not only with female stock characters in the sense of typical roles in the dramas, but also with other female persons in the area of the theatrical stage..."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Roesler and Jayandra Soni, ''Aspects of the female in Indian culture: proceedings of the symposium in ...'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=r2waAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22female+stock+characters%22&amp;dq=%22female+stock+characters%22&amp;cd=2 119].&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Griffin, Helen Ostovich, and Holger Schott Syme explain further that "Female stock characters also permit a close level of audience identification; this is true most of all in ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John|The Troublesome Raign]]'', where the '[[The Weeping Woman|weeping woman]]' type is used to dramatic advantage. This stock character provides pathos as yet another counterpoint to the plays' comic business and royal pomp."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Griffin, Helen Ostovich, and Holger Schott Syme, ''Locating the Queen's Men, 1583-1603: Material Practices and Conditions of ...'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=d8Z7uYN1OqkC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22female+stock+characters%22&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22female%20stock%20characters%22&amp;f=false 172].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tara Brabazon discusses how the "school ma'am on the colonial frontier has been a stock character of literature and film in Australia and the United States. She is an ideal foil for the ill mannered, uncivilised hero. In American literature and film, the spinster from East – generally Boston – has some stock attributes. Polly Welts Kaufman shows that 'her genteel poverty, unbending morality, education, and independent ways make her character a useful foil for the two 
other female stock characters in Western literature: the prostitute with the heart of gold and the long-suffering farmer's wife.'"&lt;ref&gt;Tara Brabazon, ''Ladies who lunge: celebrating difficult women'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdIjOrSa9ZUC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22female+stock+characters%22&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22female%20stock%20characters%22&amp;f=false 147].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright law==
In the [[United States]], [[court]]s have determined that [[copyright]] protection cannot be extended to the characteristics of stock characters in a story, whether it be a [[book]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[film]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', [[Case citation|45 F.2d 119]] ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street performance''' or '''busking''' is the act of performing in public places for [[gratuity|gratuities]]. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. People engaging in this practice are called '''street performers''' or '''buskers'''.

Performances are anything that people find [[entertainment|entertaining]]. Performers may do [[acrobatics]], [[Animal training|animal tricks]], [[balloon modelling|balloon twisting]], [[caricature]]s, [[clown]]ing, comedy, [[contortion]]s, [[escapology]], dance, singing, [[Fire performance|fire skills]], [[flea circus]], [[fortune-telling]], [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[living statue]], [[music]]al performance, [[puppeteer]]ing, [[snake charming]], [[storytelling]] or reciting poetry or [[prose]], [[street art]] such as [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] and painting, [[street theatre]], [[sword swallowing]], and [[ventriloquism]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''busking'' was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb ''to busk'', from the word ''busker'', comes from the Spanish root word ''buscar'', with the meaning "to seek".&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=busker "busker"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish word ''buscar'' in turn evolved from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word ''*bhudh-skō'' ("to win, conquer").&lt;ref name="Diccionario RAE"&gt;{{citation |url= http://dle.rae.es/?id=6LB1acb |title= buscar |work= Diccionario de la Lengua Española |edition=23rd |publisher= [[Real Academia Española]] |language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, ''[[El Buscón]]''. Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.

== History ==
There have been performances in public places for [[gratuities]] in every major culture in the world, dating back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of [[sound recording|recording]] and personal electronics.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000).[http://www.buskersadvocates.org/saahistory.html#saafranklin "The History and Cultural Impact of Street Performing in America: Ben Franklin"]. Street Performers and Buskers Advocates. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the [[barrel organ]], the [[music box]], and the [[piano roll]]. [[Organ grinder]]s were commonly found busking in the old days.

Busking is common among some [[Romani people]]. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the [[Mediterranean]] coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.

In medieval France buskers were known by the terms [[troubadour]]s and ''jongleurs''. In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as [[Minnesingers]] and ''Spielleute''. In obsolete French it evolved to ''busquer'' for "seek, prowl" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called [[skomorokh]] and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.

[[Mariachi]]s, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.&lt;ref name="WebsterMariachi"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/mariachi "mariachi"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=We like playing for big crowds, and the goal all along has been for people to pay a little to come and see us. But it all started on street corners, and that is still very connected to what we do. It's such a validating musical experience. Busking is a very humble and brave act that takes courage to do well. It's also about the energy of music being alive outside in a city ... You can walk right by it right in front of you. Sure, to some people you're just another guy with his hand out, so sometimes busking can be great social barometer. You're able to gauge who you live with on earth.&lt;ref name=Ferris&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris|first=Jedd|title=Catching Up With ...

Around the mid-19th century Japanese ''[[Chindonya]]'' started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the [[Edo period]] is [[Nankin Tamasudare]], in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.

In the United States, [[medicine show]]s proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling [[elixir]]s and [[potion]]s to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would "pass the hat".

[[One-man band]]s have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.

[[Folk music]] has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Joan Baez]]. The [[delta blues]]men were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. [[B.B. King]] is one famous example who came from these roots.

The [[counterculture]] of the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s occasionally staged "be-ins", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at [[Golden Gate Park]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were [[Janis Joplin]] with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Moby Grape]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].

[[Christmas carol]]ing can also be a form of busking, as [[wassailing]] included singing for alms, [[wassail]] or some other form of refreshment such as [[figgy pudding]]. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England [[Morris Dancing]] can be considered part of the busking tradition.

In India and Pakistan's [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] region [[Bhavai]] is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the [[barot (caste)|barot]] or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.

In the 2000s, some performers have begun "Cyber Busking". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or "stream" and if people like it they make a donation using [[PayPal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Forms ==
There are three basic forms of street performance

'''"Circle shows"''' are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], comedians, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[juggle]]rs and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.

'''"Walk-by acts"''' are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.

'''"Stoplight performers"''' present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.

=== Collecting money ===

Buskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a ''bottler'', ''hat man'', or ''pitch man'' to collect money from the audience. The term ''bottler'' is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous [[Punch and Judy]] troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times.&lt;ref name="Punch"&gt;Somerville, Chris (1997) [http://www.punchandjudy.com/bottle.htm Who is Mr Punch] ''punchandjudy.com''. Chris Somerville. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as [[monkey stick]] which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.

The place where a performance occurs is called a "pitch". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, [[rapid transit|subways]] and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any [[plaza]] or [[town square]] as well as [[zócalo]]s in Latin America and [[piazza]]s in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.

In her book, ''Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York'', Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage "Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;Tanenbaum, Susie, J.

Many cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in [[Key West]], in [[New Orleans]], in New York around [[Central Park]], [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around [[Venice Beach]], the [[Santa Monica]] [[Third Street Promenade]], and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on [[Maxwell Street]], in the [[Delmar Loop]] district of [[St. Louis]], and many other locations throughout the US.
Busking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.

In the United States under [[constitutional law]] and most European [[common law]], the protection of [[artistic]] [[free speech]] extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public [[park]]s, streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[thoroughfare]]s and [[town square]]s or [[plaza]]s. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://funandmagic.com/decision.pdf Berger v.

While there is no universal [[code of conduct]] for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding [[statutory law]]. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, what, why: Where is the hardest place in the UK to be a busker?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28112716|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Oxford City Council have decided to enact a [[public space protection order]]. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special [[License|permit]] to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the [[Loudness|volume]] of sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411newyork.org/guide/2007/07/16/street-performances-in-new-york/ |title=Street Performances in New York |publisher=411newyork.org |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that [[endangerment|endanger]] the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that "performing blue" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.

In London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2010/02/busking-in-london-explained-guide/|title= The Big Busk: London Busking Explained |author=Appleton, Natalie |date=7 February 2010|publisher= The London Insider|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as "dipping" or "skimming". [[George Burns]] described his days as a youthful busker this way:&lt;ref name="CigarBurns"&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html The Ultimate Cigar Aficionado: Ninety-eight-year-old George Burns Shares Memories of His Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307054715/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html |date=7 March 2010 }}, article and interview by Cigar Aficionado Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Other media includes a manga adaptation serialized in ''[[Comp Ace]]'' between May 2010 and January 2011; two [[visual novel]]s, released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in December 2010 and August 2012 respectively; a trading card game tie-in with Bushiroad's ''[[Weiß Schwarz]]''; and a [[light novel]] series published by [[ASCII Media Works]] under their [[Dengeki Bunko]] label.

The series is a homage to the detective fiction genre, with the four female leads named after famous fictional detectives: [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Nero Wolfe]], [[Hercule Poirot]] and [[Cordelia Gray]]. Milky Holmes is also the name of a [[Voice acting in Japan|voice acting]] unit consisting of the series' four main voice actresses; [[Suzuko Mimori]], [[Sora Tokui]], [[Mikoi Sasaki]] and [[Izumi Kitta]].

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes characters}}
Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as {{nihongo|Toys|トイズ|Toizu}}. Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the [[Yokohama]] District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Burton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.

The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Arséne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The ''Alternative'' TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.

In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try and regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. ''Futari wa Milky Holmes'', which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. ''Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD'' sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.

===Other appearances===
The four main characters of Milky Holmes appear briefly in many different episodes of ''[[Cardfight!! Vanguard]]'' as cameos where they are simply shown in the background. The voice actresses also make a cameo as the Milky Holmes in episode 23 of [[Fire Leon]], a live action series also produced by Bushiroad. In this scene, Suzuko Mimori portrays both Sherlock Shellingford and Yû Kusayanagi, a recurring character of the series. Additionally, the character "Sherlock "Sheryl" Shellingford" appears as a "guest" partner in the Japanese MMORPG Onigiri Online.

===Movie===
An idea of a movie adaptation was first teased in the form of clues hidden within the end cards of the delayed fifth episode of ''Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD'' for fans to solve. [[Tokyo MX]], [[TV Kanagawa]], [[Hokuriku Broadcasting Company|Hokuriku Broadcasting]], [[TV Aichi]] and [[Sun Television|Sun TV]] aired the same episode in different regions, but showed a different pair of letters in the end card, which when rearranged vertically could be read as "Milky Movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-02-22/detective-opera-milky-holmes-movie-teased/.85290|title=Detective Opera Milky Holmes 'Movie' Teased|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2015-02-22|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leak also emerged from the Japanese retail website Gamers' listing for the April issue of ''Monthly Bushiroad'' magazine, which included an image sample of a bundled publicity image extra which said "Milky Holmes movie adaptation planning start!!" The image has since been taken down from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-24/gamers-retail-website-lists-milky-holmes-movie-project/.85322|title=Gamers Retail Website Lists Milky Holmes Movie Project|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2015-02-24|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the project was officially revealed later in a special edition of ''Miru Miru Milky'', a variety show starring the main voice actors, and confirmed by the Milky Holmes official website the next day. However, it was also announced that they need support from the fans to realize its production, meaning the project hasn't gotten greenlit for production yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/02/26-1/milky-holmes-movie-project-needs-support-from-the-fans|title="Milky Holmes" Movie Project Needs Support from the Fans|publisher=Crunchyroll|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milky-holmes.com/news/2015/02/26/1974|script-title=ja:「ミルキィホームズ映画化企画」スタート|publisher=Milky Holmes Official Website|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-03-31|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Smurfs''''' ({{lang-fr|Les Schtroumpfs}}; {{lang-nl|De Smurfen}}) is a Belgian [[comic]] franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in [[mushroom]]-shaped houses in the forest. ''The Smurfs'' was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the [[Belgian comics]] artist [[Peyo]] (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as ''Les Schtroumpfs''. There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as "Jokey Smurf", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. "Smurfette" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear [[Phrygian cap]]s, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.

The word “smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French "schtroumpf", which, according to Peyo, is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist [[André Franquin]] when he could not remember the word salt.&lt;ref name=Franquin/&gt;&lt;ref name="nl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/smurf|title=SMURF (BLAUW STRIPFIGUURTJE)|last=De Coster|first=Marc|date=2007|website=etymologiebank.nl|publisher=Meertens Institute|language=nl|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/peyo.htm|title=Peyo|website=lambiek.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Smurfs'' franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, [[ice capade]]s, video games, theme parks, and dolls.

==Origin==
At the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series titled ''Johan et Pirlouit'' (translated to English as ''[[Johan and Peewit]]''), set in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] and including elements of [[sword-and-sorcery]]. Johan serves as a brave young page to the [[monarch|king]], and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, [[midget]] [[sidekick]]. 
In 1958, ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine started to publish the ''Johan et Pirlouit'' story ''La Flûte à six trous'' ("The Flute with Six Holes").&lt;ref name=BDO-s&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Spirou année 1958|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/annees/1958.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adventure involved them recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a "Schtroumpf", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in ''Spirou'' on October 23, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Smurfs preparing big 50th birthday celebrations |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/art/2008/01/16/139306/Smurfs-preparing.htm  |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[The China Post]] |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in ''Spirou'' in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled ''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (also the title of the [[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute|movie version of the story]]).

With the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting [[PVC]] Smurfs and Smurf merchandise.

===Name===
''Schtroumpf'' is pronounced like the German word "Strumpf" meaning "sock". However, according to Peyo, the original author of the Smurfs comic strip, the term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he had with his colleague and friend [[André Franquin]] at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word "salt", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the ''schtroumpf''. Franquin jokingly replied, "Here's the ''Schtroumpf''—when you are done ''schtroumpfing'', ''schtroumpf'' it back..." and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in "''schtroumpf'' language".&lt;ref name=Franquin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franquin.com/amis/peyo_amis.php |title=Franquin's official Web site |publisher=Franquin.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek" /&gt; The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English.&lt;ref name="nl" /&gt;

Both the comics and cartoons have been translated in many languages. In most cases, the original name "Schtroumpf" is replaced by a new term. The most common are variations on the Dutch translation "Smurf", while other names are indicative of their [[gnome|gnome-like]] appearance.

In Spanish, they are called "Pitufos", a term invented by Miguel Agustí who was the head of the Spanish magazine ''Strong'' which first published the cartoon in Spanish. According to Agustí, he was walking around Barcelona while trying to come up a name for the cartoon. He came across a sculpture of the Ox of [[Patufet]] and was inspired by the word Patufet. From Patufet he derived the non-existent word Pitufo. The name later spread to most Spanish-language versions of the cartoon.

==Smurfs universe==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--many paragraphs without citations--&gt;
===Smurfs===
The storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: [[Smurfette]], Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (three apples high),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110324032830/http://www.smurf.com/smurf.php/www/meet/en SMURF]. smurf.com&lt;/ref&gt; with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a [[Phrygian cap]], and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, "Handy Smurf" wears [[Overall (bib-and-brace)|overalls]] instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]] (a species of ''[[Smilax]]'') leaves, whose berries the Smurfs naturally call "smurfberries" (the smurfberries appear only in the cartoon; in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the sarsaparilla).

The Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: "Lazy Smurf", "Grouchy Smurf", "Brainy Smurf", and so on. All Smurfs, with the exception of Papa, Baby, Smurfette, Nanny and Grandpa, are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 99 Smurfs, but this number increased as new Smurf characters appeared, such as Sassette and Nanny. All of the original Smurfs were male; later female additions are Smurfette and Sassette—Smurfette being Gargamel's creation, while Sassette was created by the Smurflings.

===Language {{anchor|smurf_as_a_word}}===
A characteristic of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word "smurf" and its derivatives in a variety of meanings. The Smurfs frequently replace both [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s in everyday speech with the word "smurf": "We're going ''smurfing'' on the River Smurf today." When used as a verb, the word "Smurf" typically means "to make", "to be", "to like", or "to do".

Humans have found that replacing ordinary words with the term "smurf" at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement "I'm smurfing to the smurf" means "I'm going to the wood", but a Smurf corrects him by saying that the proper statement would be "I'm smurfing to the smurf"; whereas what Peewit said was "I'm warbling to the dawn". So "I'm smurfing to the smurf" is not the same as "I'm smurfing to the smurf".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Sortilège de Maltrochu'' (French for "Maltrochu's Spell"), written and drawn by Peyo, published in 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animated series, only some words (or a portion of the word) are replaced with the word "smurf". Context offers a reliable understanding of this speech pattern, but common vocabulary includes remarking that something is "just smurfy" or in some cases, "smurftastic".

In ''Schtroumpf vert et vert Schtroumpf'' (see ''[[Smurf Versus Smurf]]''), published in Belgium in 1972, it was revealed that the smurf village was divided between North and South, and that the Smurfs on either side had different ideas as to how the term "smurf" should be used: for instance, the Northern Smurfs called a certain object a "bottle smurfer", while the Southern Smurfs called it a "smurf opener". This story is considered a [[parody]] on the still ongoing ''[[taalstrijd]]'' (language war) between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/murray/20071106.html |title=CBC News: Reports from abroad, Nov 2007 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smurf village===
When they first appeared in 1958, the Smurfs lived in a part of the world called "''Le Pays Maudit''" (French for "the Cursed Land"). To reach it required magic or travelling through dense [[forest]]s, deep [[marsh]]es, a scorching [[desert]] and a high [[mountain range]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (published in 1958) and ''Le Pays maudit'' (published in 1961), both written and drawn by Peyo&lt;/ref&gt; The Smurfs themselves use [[stork]]s in order to travel long distances, such as to the kingdom where Johan and Pirlouit live, and keep up-to-date with events in the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;''La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs'' (published in 1958), written and drawn by Peyo&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Johan et Pirlouit'' stories, the Smurf village is made up of mushroom-like houses of different shapes and sizes in a desolate and rocky land with just a few trees. However, in the Smurf series itself, the mushroom-like houses are more similar to one another and are located in a clearing in the middle of a deep forest with grass, a river, and vegetation. Humans such as [[Gargamel]] are shown to live nearby, though it is almost impossible for an outsider to find the Smurf village except when led by a Smurf.

===Smurf economy===
The Smurfs' [[commune|community]] generally takes the form of a [[cooperative]], sharing, and kind environment based on the principle that each Smurf has something he or she is good at, and thus contributes it to Smurf society as he or she can. In return, each Smurf appears to be given their necessities of life, from housing and clothes to food without using any [[money]] in exchange.

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of The Smurfs characters}}
Papa Smurf is the leader of the community. Other Smurfs are generally named after their personality disposition, much like [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Disney's Seven Dwarfs]]; for example, Brainy, Greedy, Vanity, Lazy, Clumsy, Hefty, Jokey, Dreamy, Grouchy, or their profession, for example, Poet, Actor, Handy, Harmony, Farmer, Clockwork, Painter, Tailor, Miner, Architect, Reporter, Timber, Barber and Doctor Smurf. The first female Smurf, Smurfette, was created by Gargamel to lure the other Smurfs. Papa Smurf then changed her into what we see today. The non-Smurf characters who would appear later would include their enemies the wizard [[Gargamel]], his cat Azrael, an ugly witch, Hogatha and Gargamel's godfather Balthazar; and their friends the page Johan and his young friend Peewit and the wizard Homnibus. There are 105 Smurfs.

==Smurf comics==
{{Main article|The Smurfs (comics)}}
Since the first appearance of the Smurfs in ''Johan et Pirlouit'' in 1958, 31 Smurf comics volumes have been created, 16 of them by Peyo, the others by his studio. Originally, the Smurf stories appeared in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher [[Dupuis]], many comics were first published in dedicated Smurf magazines, which existed in French, Dutch, German and Turkish. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected into comic books next to the regular series of 30 including a newly released Smurfs comics enitiled ''Les Schtroumpfs de L'ordre'' (''The Order [[Law]] of the Smurfs''). English translations have been published in the U.S. by the graphic novel publisher Papercutz as well as a mini series published by [[Marvel Comics]] in the mid-1980s.

===Motion pictures===
In 1965, a [[black-and-white]] 87-minute [[animated]] [[film]] called ''[[Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs]]'' was released in theatres in Belgium. It consisted of five short cartoons made in the previous years for broadcasting on [[Walloons|Walloon]] TV. German copies and copies with Dutch subtitles are known to exist. The stories were based on existing Smurf stories like ''The Black Smurfs'' and ''The Smurfs and the Egg'', and were created by writer [[Maurice Rosy]] and artist [[Eddy Ryssack]] from the small Dupuis animation studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledoux.be/nl/jeunesjong.htm |title=Koninklijk Belgisch Filmarchief |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=Koninklijk Belgisch Filmarchief |language=Dutch |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070510035306/http://www.ledoux.be/nl/jeunesjong.htm |archivedate = May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, ten animated shorts were created between 1961 and 1967, the first series in black and white and the later ones in colour.

In 1976, ''La Flûte à six schtroumpfs'' (an adaptation of the original "Johan et Pirlouit" story) was released. [[Michel Legrand]] provided the musical score to the film. The film would be released in the United States in 1983 (after the animated series became popular there) in an English language dubbed version titled ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]''. A few more full-length Smurf films were made, most notably ''The Baby Smurf'' and ''Here are the Smurfs'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258438/ IMDb entry for The Baby Smurf], [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258649/ IMDb entry for Here are the Smurfs]&lt;/ref&gt; created from episodes of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon series.

[[Sony Pictures]] has announced plans to begin a [[trilogy]] of [[live-action]]/[[computer-animated]] Smurf films, with the [[The Smurfs (film)|first]] film released on July 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smurfs – Sony Pictures Official Movie Site|url=http://www.smurfhappens.com/|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had been in various stages of development since 2003.&lt;ref name=Time50&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1703303,00.html |title=The Smurfs Are Off to Conquer the World – Again|accessdate=2008-01-15 |author=Leo Cendrowicz |date=January 15, 2008 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]] had acquired film rights from Lafig Belgium.

===Television series===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (TV series)}}
The Smurfs secured their place in North American [[pop culture]] in 1981, when the [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday-morning cartoon]] series ''The Smurfs'', produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in association with SEPP International S.A.R.L, aired on [[NBC]] from September 12, 1981 to December 2, 1989 (reruns until August 25, 1990). The show continued to air on the USA network until 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]] until 2003. ''The Smurfs'' is still broadcast on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] channel throughout the United States. The show became a major success for NBC, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. ''The Smurfs'' was nominated multiple times for [[Daytime Emmy]] awards, and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982–1983.&lt;ref name=Time50/&gt; ''The Smurfs'' television show enjoyed continued success until 1990, when, after nearly a decade of success, NBC cancelled it due to decreasing ratings and plans to extend their ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' [[breakfast television|morning show]] franchise to create a [[Weekend Today|Saturday edition]], although they did not do so until [[1992 in American television|1992]] (two years later). The decreased ratings were the result of the network changing the format of the show, resulting in the final season featuring regular time travel with only a few Smurfs.

In the TV series, many classical masterpieces are used as background music during the episodes, among them [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished Symphony]] (Symphony No. 8 in B minor), [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s [[Pictures at an Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/071097/jfl1.html Montreal Mirror article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030129150440/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/071097/jfl1.html |date=January 29, 2003 }}, [http://www.astrostreasurechest.net/websmurfclub/faq.htm Astro's Treasure Chest website article]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115113055/http://www.astrostreasurechest.net/websmurfclub/faq.htm |date=November 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reruns of the show are played on the Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang.

''The Smurfs'' was named the 97th best animated series by [[IGN]]. It was called "kiddie cocaine" for people growing up during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ign100"&gt;{{cite web |title=97, The Smurfs |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/97.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-01-23 |date=January 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005239/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/97.html |archivedate=January 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossovers===
{{main article|Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue}}
Papa Smurf, Hefty Smurf, and Brainy Smurf appeared in the cartoon crossover ''Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue'' along with [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]] (from the [[Looney Tunes]] franchise), [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] (from ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Tigger]], [[Alvin and the Chipmunks (1983 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]], the [[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies|Muppet Babies]] ([[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Piggy]] and [[Gonzo the Great|Gonzo]] respectively), [[Ghostbusters (franchise)#Slimer|Slimer]] (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''), ''[[List of ALF characters#Gordon Shumway|ALF]]'', [[Michelangelo (TMNT)|Michelangelo]] (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''). Smurfette appeared on the promotional poster, but never{{clarify|date=April 2013}} appeared in the actual film.

===Merchandising===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (merchandising)}}
From 1959 until the end of the 1960s, Dupuis produced Smurf figurines. But the best known and most widely available Smurf figurines are those made by [[Schleich]], a German toy company. Most of the Smurf figurines given away as promotional material (e.g. by National Garages in the 1970s and [[McDonald's]] in the 1990s) are also made by Schleich.

New Smurf figures continue to appear; in fact, only in two years since 1969 (1991 and 1998) have no new Smurfs entered the market. Schleich currently produces 8 to 12 new figurines a year. Over 300 million of them have been sold so far.&lt;ref name="Time50"/&gt;

Other Smurf figurines have been created for advertising purposes, e.g. worldwide for McDonald's and [[Kinder Surprise]], or nationally for e.g. [[Albert Heijn]] in the Netherlands, and [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] in Belgium.

Special Smurf comics were often created for advertising campaigns. This started in the 1960s for [[Kwatta (chocolate)|Kwatta]] and [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], and later for companies like [[BP]] in the UK and Australia, or [[Benco]] (a Dutch chocolate drink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/sfigures6/schtroumpfs/benco.htm |title=Benco et les Schtroumpfs at |publisher=Bdoubliees.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These comics were often only part of a larger campaign, e.g. the Benco comics were accompanied by a TV ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ina.fr/pub/alimentation-boisson/video/PUB3213293047/benco-poudre-chocolatee-les-stroumpfs.fr.html ad available at the INA (Institut national de l'audiovisuel) website]. Ina.fr (September 14, 1979). Retrieved on 2013-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Smurf balloon/float/[[Falloon]] (which is half float half balloon) continues to be presented in holiday parades such as [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2008 Parade Lineup |url=http://holidays.consummatecompendium.com/Thanksgiving/2008-Macy's-Thanksgiving-Day-Parade-Lineup.html |website=holidays.consummatecompendium.com |accessdate=March 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130120034214/http://holidays.consummatecompendium.com/2008-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-lineup/ |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smurfs had two cereals in the 1980s made by [[Post Cereals]]: Smurf-Berry Crunch cereal and Smurfs Magic Berries. Both had animated commercials on Saturday morning. Two Smurfs pastas, made by [[Chef Boyardee]] and [[DelVerde]] were made in the 1980s, as well. Also [[Libby's]] &amp; [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] came out with Smurf-A-Getti canned pasta for the American and Canadian market.

The Smurfs had a commercial in the 1980s for the Mexican snack cake company [[Marinela]] Submarinos with a rare version of ''Smurfette (Pitufina)'' dressed in a red dress and her hair done in pigtails.

===Music recordings===
{{Main article|The Smurfs (music)}}
Over the decades, many singles and albums of Smurf music have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. The best known is the single ''[[The Smurf Song]]'' and its accompanying album, created by Dutch musician [[Pierre Kartner]] who sings under the alias Father Abraham, which reached the #1 position in 16 countries. Worldwide, more than 10 million CDs with Smurf music have been sold between 2005 and 2007 alone.&lt;ref name=Time50/&gt;

In 1989, I.M.P.S and R-Tek Music, International created [[Smurfin!: Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Album]], released by Quality Special Products in Canada and The US and Dino Music in Australia. It was also released in parts of Europe. The Album came out on LP, CD and cassette. The LP featured 20 tracks (The Canadian CD and cassette had 16, the American CD had 10). The songs were covers of popular songs like [[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]], [[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]], [[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]] and [[I Think We're Alone Now]], as well as two original songs.

===Smurfs on Ice===
For several years, the Smurfs were the children's act in the [[Ice Capades]] travelling ice show. After they were retired from that function, the Smurf suits from the show were issued to Ice Capades Chalets, the show's subsidiary chain of [[ice rink]]s, lasting until the show was sold to a group of investors led by [[Dorothy Hamill]]. The Chalets were sold to Recreation World. The Smurfette suit in particular had a somewhat different hairstyle from what was portrayed in the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

In 1984, the Smurfs began appearing in North American theme parks owned by [[Kings Entertainment Company|Kings Entertainment Corporation]]. Each park featured a Smurf attraction and Smurf walk-around figures. [[Canada's Wonderland]] had an entire Smurf village to walk through, ending with Gargamel's Castle. "[[Phantom Theater#Smurf's Enchanted Voyage (1984–1991)|The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage]]" was located in [[Kings Island]]. [[Kings Dominion]] has "[[Smurf Mountain]]". [[California's Great America]] featured a pint-sized steel coaster, "[[Woodstock's Express (California's Great America)|The Blue Streak]]". [[Carowinds]] had an artificial island that was named Smurf Island that had a Smurf village—including toadstool houses which could be entered. [[Hanna–Barbera Land]] had a Smurf district.

In 1989, in the France region of Lorraine, the Sorépark group opened a complete Smurfpark, named [[Walygator Parc|Big Bang Schtroumpf]]. In 1991, the park was bought by the successful Belgian Walibi Group and renamed Walibi Schtroumpf with new attractions. After the Walibi Group was acquired by [[Six Flags]], the park was named Walibi Lorraine, and all the Smurfs references in the park were removed in 2003.

Comics Station, [[Motiongate Dubai]], [[MAPS Perak|Movie Animation Park Studios]] and [[Island of Dreams (amusement park)|Dream Island]] feature Smurf sections.

===UNICEF===
In 2005, an advertisement featuring the Smurfs was aired in Belgium in which the Smurf village is annihilated by warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did UNICEF bomb the Smurf Village?|url=http://bluebuddies.com/help/unicef_smurf_bombing.htm|website=bluebuddies.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed as a [[UNICEF]] advertisement, and with the approval of the family of the Smurfs' late creator Peyo, the 25-second episode was shown on the national television after the 9 p.m. timeslot to avoid children having to see it. It was the keystone in a fund-raising campaign by UNICEF's Belgian arm to raise money for the rehabilitation of former [[Military use of children|child soldiers]] in [[Burundi]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]—both former Belgian colonies.

In honour of their 50th anniversary in 2008, the Smurfs began a year-long "Happy Smurfday Euro Tour" in connection with UNICEF. The Smurfs visited fifteen European countries on the day of their 50th "Smurfday" in the form of publicly distributed white figurines. The recipients could decorate and submit them to a competition. The results of this contest were auctioned off and raised a total amount of 124,700 euros for benefit of UNICEF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Charity-auction-of-15-celebrity-Smurfs-on-50th-anniversary/tabid/418/articleID/77210/Default.aspx | title=Charity auction of 15 celebrity Smurfs on 50th anniversary | publisher=[[3news.co.nz]] | agency=Associated Press | date=October 25, 2008 | accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coins===
The 50th anniversary of the Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator [[Peyo]], were celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors' coin: the Belgian 5 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2008 coinage|50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

==Sociological discussion==
In 1998, writer Marc Schmidt wrote a parody article citing the Smurfs as an example of the impact of socialism in continental European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/03/142_30610.html |title=Smurfs: Metaphor for Socialism? |publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Marc|title=Socio-Political Themes in The Smurfs|url=http://www.pop-cultured.net/socio-political-themes-in-the-smurfs/|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Schmidt's essay was scrutinised in a response essay by Kate Krake, who examined the nature of cultural theory built on textual observation and warned against creating false allegories out of texts like The Smurfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krake|first=Kate|title=In Theory – A Response to Socio-Political Themes in The Smurfs |url=http://www.pop-cultured.net/in-theory-a-response-to-socio-political-themes-in-the-smurfs// |publisher=Pop Cultured|accessdate=August 13, 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French sociologist Antoine Buéno described them in a 2011 book as a totalitarian and racist utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/the-smurfs-are-racist-ant_n_870758.html|publisher=Huffington Post |title=The Smurfs Are Racist, Anti-Semites, Antoine Buéno Suggests in 'Le Petit Livre Bleu' |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Peyo head Thierry Culliford, the son of Peyo, dismissed Buéno's accusations as "grotesque and frivolous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2011/sieg-smurf/ |title=Sieg Smurf ! |publisher=forbidden planet international |date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
