'''1816 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 7 November — [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship, defeating an unnamed opponent in a contest that lasted 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb].  Retrieved on 18 April 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo Archived] 2009-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* Formation of the [[Manchester Cricket Club]] which takes part in a number of first-class matches until [[Lancashire CCC]] is established in 1864.  Manchester is representative of Lancashire as a county in the same way that [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and [[Nottingham Cricket Club]] represent Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
* The issue of [[roundarm bowling]] is already controversial enough for MCC to amend the [[Laws of Cricket]] to prohibit it: 
:''The ball must be bowled (not thrown or jerked), and be delivered underhand, with the hand below the elbow. But if the ball be jerked, or the arm extended from the body horizontally, and any part of the hand be uppermost, or the hand horizontally extended when the ball is delivered, the Umpires shall call "No Ball"''.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] 363 (HS 74)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] 30 (BB 5–?)

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Rhoda (horse)|Rhoda]]
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Nectar 
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Prince Leopold (horse)|Prince Leopold]] 
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Landscape (horse)|Landscape]]
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[The Duchess (horse)|The Duchess]]

{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
An '''all-star''' (also stylized as '''All-Star''') team is a group of people all having a high level of performance in their field.  Originating in sports, it has since drifted into [[vernacular]] and been borrowed heavily by the [[entertainment industry]].

==Sports==
{{Main|All-star game}}

"All-star" as a sports term refers to individual players named to an "all-star" roster or team representing the top performers (members of such a team were ''all [[wikt:star|star]]s'' from other teams) during and before the end of a season in a given sport, or to a list of top participants who played in individual sports such as [[golf]] and [[bowling]]. Events limited to such honorees are referred to as "all-star games" or events.

In American team sports the premier all-star [[game]]s are the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], [[NBA All-Star Game]], [[Pro Bowl]], [[NHL All-Star Game]], and the [[MLS All-Star Game]]. Many all-star teams, such as collegiate "all-conference" and [[All-America]] squads, are recognitions of performance only, without the connotation of those selected ever being teammates in a game.

In [[gaelic games]], the term "all-stars" refers to the [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards]]. These awards involve picking a fantasy team consisting of the top players in each position in the various sports ([[List of All Stars Awards winners (football)|Gaelic football]], [[Ladies' Gaelic football All Stars Awards|Ladies' Gaelic football]], [[List of All Stars Awards winners (hurling)|hurling]], [[Rounders All Stars Awards|rounders]] and [[Camogie All Stars Awards|camogie]]).

==Entertainment==
===Cinema===
The term '''all-star''' also used in films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey head all-star cast in ‘The Butler’ |publisher= Boston Herald| url = http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/movie_reviews/2013/08/forest_whitaker_and_oprah_winfrey_head_all_star_cast_in |date=August 16, 2013| accessdate = 2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used as a form of [[publicity]] [[gimmick]] to promote the cast of a movie in which a number of high-profile actors appear, sometimes merely in [[cameo appearance|cameo]] roles. An archetype is the 1956 version of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.

===Television===
In television, there are a number of groups who could be considered all-stars. Many reality competition shows produce All-Stars editions, which feature notable and particularly talented contestants of past regular seasons of the show. For example, the reality game show franchise, ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', has had several editions where some or all of the cast featured are "All Stars". There have been three All-Stars editions of the American reality game show ''[[The Amazing Race]]''. Other all-stars editions of U.S. shows include ''[[Bad Girls All-Star Battle]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model (season 17)|America's Next Top Model 17]]'', and ''[[Charm School (TV series)|Charm School]]''. ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'' has also had three seasons of an All Stars [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]. The [[Dancing on Ice (series 9)|ninth series]] of the British television show ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' was an All-Stars edition.

Another use for all-star contestants is to appear on other reality competition programs (especially if the shows are on the same network). This is especially prevalent on [[CBS]]'s three reality competition programs, ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|Big Brother]]''.

===Video games===
The term "all-stars" has recently been used to describe/title video games that feature large casts of iconic characters in a crossover-type setting. Notable examples include ''[[PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale]]'' and ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]''.

&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;\relative c'' { \times 2/3 {g8 c e} g8.\staccato e16 g2 }&lt;/score&gt;

It was written by [[Tommy Walker (events director)|Tommy Walker]] while a junior at the [[University of Southern California]] in the fall of 1946.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Paul Collins (American writer)|Paul Collins]] |coauthors= |title=You Say It's Your Birthday|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2298271/ |quote=Wikipedia entries since 2007 attributed the song to 1940s University of Southern California composer Tommy Walker—a contention bolstered by a link to Sports Illustrated's online archive, which featured Walker's own story of the tune's composition with co-writer Dick Winslow. |newspaper=[[Slate magazine]] |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fanfare consists of six notes followed by rooters shouting, "Charge!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136204/index.htm|title=Give Him Credit For The Charge|date=November 12, 1990|accessdate=April 12, 2011|last=Anderson|first=Bruce|journal=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, the fanfare is repeated one or more times in the same key or in successively higher keys, or is preceded by a lead-in vamp.

In 1958 the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] moved to [[Los Angeles]] and in the spring of 1959 the Dodgers put on sale, at $1.50 apiece, 20,000 toy trumpets capable of playing the six notes of the "Charge" fanfare.  The fanfare was heard in NBC broadcasts of games 3, 4 and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] between the Dodgers and the [[Chicago White Sox]].

It also appeared in the original ''[[The Flintstones]]'' 1960s television cartoon series (episode dates uncertain), followed by "Charge!" or "Charge it!", shouted by characters (typically [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]) on the way to a shopping spree.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; [[Scrappy-Doo]], a character that appeared in the 1980s incarnations of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise, also regularly used the fanfare as a lead-in to his catchphrase, "puppy power!"{{or|date=August 2015}}  The fanfare was incorporated into the jingles used on ''[[Scott Shannon]]'s Rockin American Top 30 Countdown'' which ran from 1984 through 1992. In the [[first person shooter]] video game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', the character Bastion makes a noise similar to this fanfare when it uses its ultimate ability.

Bobby Kent, former musical director of the [[San Diego Chargers]], has claimed he invented the "Charge" fanfare in 1978 while working for the Chargers.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia-Roberts|first=Gus|title=Bobby Kent Claims He Invented "Da Da Da Da Da Da Charge!" And Wants to Cash In|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2011/04/bobby_kent_claims_he_invented.php|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent filed suit against [[ASCAP]] for negotiating licenses with [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]], [[NHL]], [[NCAA]] and [[NASCAR]] while failing to secure his consent. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] settled with Kent for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|title=The guy who composed "da-da-da-da-da-da … Charge!" is suing everyone|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/19/the-guy-who-composed-da-da-da-da-da-da-charge-is-suing-everyone/|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's claim can be disproven by the fact that Frank Leahy, the Chargers' first general manager in 1960, chose the name "Chargers" after the already existing fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise nicknames|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/franchise-nicknames/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[The Kennel Club]] conducted a survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that one in five did not walk their dogs on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1300658/Walkies-Fat-chance-One-dog-owners-lazy-pets-day.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Walkies?

Commonly, the dog is walked by the guardian, or by another family member, but there are also professional dog walkers.&lt;ref name="lawyer"/&gt;

==Health benefits==
A study by [[Michigan State University]] showed that people who walk their dogs are 34% more likely to meet expected levels of exercise, with a recommended level of 150 minutes of activity such as dog walking per week. Matthew Reeves, the co-author of the study said, "There is no magic bullet in getting people to reach those benchmarks but walking a dog has a measurable impact."&lt;ref name=notjust&gt;{{cite news|title=Walkies Not Just For Dogs|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/234034/Walkies-not-just-for-dogs|newspaper=Daily Express|date=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[University of Western Australia]] has discovered that walking your dog helps build relationships in your community research showed that people in the community would acknowledge and greet other people in the street exchange favors with neighbors which can encourage more exercise in the community giving pets and owners a chance at a healthier life.

==Professional dog walkers==
[[File:Dog walker on skates with six dogs cropped.jpg|thumb|right|This professional dog walker on skates is pulled rapidly down a street by six dogs in [[Summit, New Jersey]].]]
Professional dog walkers, both individuals and businesses, are paid by dog owners to walk their dogs for them.  Some dog walkers will take many dogs for a walk at once, while others will only take a single dog.&lt;ref name="lawyer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Lawyer-wants-to-bring-dog.6272446.jp|title=Lawyer wants to bring dog walkers to heel|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=5 May 2010|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of a walk might vary by breed or owners request ranging from short relief walks to longer walks with a specific amount of time set by the owner.  Also growing in popularity is "dog running". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a20864740/full-time-dog-runner/| title = Full-time Dog Runner | publisher=runnersworld.com| accessdate=8 June 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dog runners are professionals who run with dogs, rather than walking with them. In some jurisdictions, dog walking businesses must be licensed and have animal first-aid-trained employees. Professional dog walking services can be obtained locally or through online referral services. Obtaining a position as a professional dog walker has become more difficult, with applicants having to pass rigorous exams and go through extensive training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-a-job-as-a-dog-walker-its-just-like-getting-into-harvard-1507214545|title=Want a Job as a Dog Walker?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21328">'''Fitness culture''' is a [[sociocultural]] phenomenon which refers to the culture surrounding [[physical exercises]]. It is usually associated with ''gym culture'', as doing physical exercises in locations such as [[gyms]], wellness centres and [[health clubs]] is a popular activity. An international survey found that more than 27% of world total adult population attends fitness centres, and that 61% of regular exercisers are currently doing "gym-type" activities.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Tim. 2013. “Fitness is the World’s Biggest Sport”.

== Development ==

=== Gymnastics of ancient Greece and Rome ===
In [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a public place devoted to athletes training, called ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]'' (plural: gymnasia) for Greeks and ''[[palaestra]]'' (plural: palaestrae) for Romans existed in cities. Fitness was regarded as a concept shaped by two cultural codes: [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[asceticism]]; authenticity and [[hedonism]], respectively. In Greece, gymnastic excellence was regarded as a noble and godly pursuit, and was included in a complete education. Gymnasiums became the center of the community, being associated with the arts, the study of logic, and a source of entertainment. Skilled athletes attained an elevated status and devoted their lives to becoming proficient in exercise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1859/05/the-gymnasium/305407/|title = The Gymnasium|date = 1 May 1859|accessdate = 19 March 2015|website = The Atlantic|publisher = The Atlantic Monthly Group|last = Cheever|first = David W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
From around 1800, [[gymnastics]] developed in Western countries was meant to enhance body in order to sustain public morals and to mold better citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9780230507494 Fit Bodies. Fitness Culture and Gym] Sassatelli, Roberta. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pehr Henrik Ling]] was a pioneer in the teaching of [[physical education]] in [[Sweden]], and he sought to reform and improve the gymnastics of the ancient Greeks. In 1850, the Supreme Medical Board of Russia reported to their [[Russian Emperor|emperor]] on Ling's system, that by improving one's overall fitness, an athlete became superior to those who merely focused on a subset of muscles or actions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the mid 19th century the world saw the rise of [[physical culture]], a movement that emphasized the importance of physical exercise for men, women, and children alike. [[Diocletian Lewis]], a physician, even advocated for males and females exercising together in the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1862/08/the-new-gymnastics/305408/|title = The New Gymnastics|date = 1 August 1862|accessdate = 19 March 2015|website = The Atlantic|publisher = The Atlantic Monthly Group|last = Lewis|first = Diocletian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
Leading up to and during [[World War II]], [[totalitarian]] regimes used gymnastics as a way to promote their [[ideologies]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physical fitness was at the core of [[Nazi philosophy]], and the [[Germany|German]] government financed the construction of sports and wellness facilities. In 1922, the [[Nazi Party]] established the [[Hitler Youth]], where children and adolescents participated in physical activities to develop both their physical and mental fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theholocaustexplained.org/ks3/life-in-nazi-occupied-europe/controlling-everyday-life/sport-and-leisure/#.VQtjW1PF9kI|title = How did the Nazis control leisure?|date = 2011|accessdate = 19 March 2015|website = The Holocaust Explained|publisher = London Jewish Cultural Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi sports imagery served the purpose of promoting the myth of "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" racial superiority, and in 1933, an "Aryans only" policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005680|title = The Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936|date = 20 June 2014|accessdate = 19 March 2015|website = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union|Leninist Young Communist League]] created the [[Ready for Labour and Defence of the USSR]] in 1931, which was a fitness program that was designed to improve [[public health]] and prepare the population for highly productive work and the defense of "the motherland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Great Soviet Encyclopedia|last = |first = |publisher = The Gale Group, Inc|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ready+for+Labor+and+Defense+of+the+Ussr|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cold War ===
During the [[Cold War]], a focus on physical fitness emerged in both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] gravely warned that [[communist]] dominance came from superior sports and fitness programs. His remarks reflected the growing American [[Macarthyism|paranoia of communism]]. In response, leaders of the military, civilian government, and private sector began crafting a "cult and ritual of toughness".&lt;ref name="Kemper2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt Edward Kemper|title=College Football and American Culture in the Cold War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvVSjoaAiUQC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03466-4|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] issued a call to the nation urging Americans to prioritize their physical fitness across the country. Fitness was clearly described as a "matter of achieving an optimum state of well-being" that required exercise from both young and old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1961/11/we-may-be-sitting-ourselves-to-death/306504/ |title = We May Be Sitting Ourselves to Death|date = 1 November 1961|accessdate = 19 March 2015|website = The Atlantic|publisher = The Atlantic Monthly Group |last = Neu|first = Frank R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on fitness also opened the doors for female athletes in both the U.S. and the USSR to become more prominent as contenders in [[the Olympics]].&lt;ref name="McComb1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=David G. McComb |title=Sports: An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEZ1e-31PqoC&amp;pg=PA123 |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510097-6 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass participation, commercialization ===
After World War II, a new form of non-organized, individualistic, health-oriented physical and recreational activities such as [[jogging]] began to prevail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans]] (1961) developed by [[Bill Orban]] and United States Air Force Colonel [[Kenneth H. Cooper|Kenneth Cooper's]] books "''Aerobics''" (1968) and mass-market version "''The New Aerobics''" (1979) helped to launch modern fitness culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/22/health/he-62349|title=Going Back to the Basics With Calisthenics|last=KRUCOFF|first=CAROL|date=1998-06-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadas-fitness-movement-5-basic-exercises|title=Five basic exercises for fitness in 1961|last=|first=|date=|work=CBC Archives|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/aerobics-kenneth-cooper-to-receive-harvard-healthy-cup-award/|title=“Father of Aerobics” Kenneth Cooper, MD, MPH to receive Healthy Cup Award from Harvard School of Public Health|date=2008-04-16|work=News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clubindustry.com/forprofits/dr-kenneth-cooper-and-how-he-became-known-father-aerobics|title=Dr. Kenneth Cooper and How He Became Known as the Father of Aerobics|date=2008-09-01|work=Club Industry|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[Running boom of the 1970s|running boom in the 1970s]] inspired by the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/opinion/running-on-empty-an-american-sports-tradition-fades.html|title=Running on Empty: An American Sports Tradition Fades|last=Stracher|first=Cameron|date=|work=|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aerobics]] – a form of group gymnastic activity performed with the support of music – became popular in the 1980s after the release of [[Jane Fonda]]'s exercise videos in 1982. 

Fitness began to be commercialised. Gyms were set up with the goals not to improve [[public health]] but to stimulate and exploit the desire of people to keep fit, have fun and improve themselves. It can also be observed in today's gyms where [[bodybuilders]] are trying to reach their aesthetic ideas, through muscle development, using [[Weight training|weights]] and other equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277018421_The_Fitness_Revolution_Historical_Transformations_in_a_Global_Gym_and_Fitness_Culture|title=(PDF) The Fitness Revolution.

The term ''gym'' is often associated with the term ''fitness'' and going to gyms means doing exercises in fitness institutions such as fitness centres, health clubs or gym clubs where people have to pay for membership in order to use fitness equipment and participate in group fitness activities with instructors, such as aerobics and yoga classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Technology, specialization, branding ===
Advances in technology in the twenty-first have changed the way of doing fitness activities. The ''[[Quantified self|Quantified Self]]'' has become a new phenomenon, where people use technological devices to support their workouts. It is characterized by the use of gadgets such as [[pedometer]], [[GPS]], [[heart rate monitor]] and smartphone apps to quantify or monitor the exerciser’s efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyer|first1=James|title=Quantified Bodies|journal=Digital Culture &amp; Society|date=March 2016|volume=2|issue=1|page=161|url=http://digicults.org/vol-2-issue-12016-quantified-selves-statistical-bodies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a decrease in popularity of “pure aerobics” exercises.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The attention is moving from aerobics, bodybuilding and traditional technique of exercises, to new forms of exercises such as [[yoga]], [[zumba]], [[pilates]], [[Indoor cycling|spinning]] and aquacycling, [[Tai Chi Chuan|tai chi]], [[kickboxing]], and [[outdoor fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17818223|title=The rise of the adult playground|last=|first=|date=7 May 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=6 October 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/30/outdoor-fitness-parkrun-british-military-forces-project-awesome-parks|title=‘We still come if the rain’s sideways’ – how Britain fell in love with outdoor fitness|last=|first=|date=30 August 2016|work=|access-date=4 October 2018|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/01/15/rise-outdoor-gyms-signals-muscling-up-outdoor-fitness-industry/|title=Rise in outdoor gyms signals a muscling-up of the outdoor fitness industry|last=|first=|date=15 January 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 October 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercises have been commercialized as branded exercises by fitness institutions. Branded exercises are group workouts developed by fitness institutions for people with different goals of fitness.

== Influences ==

=== Mass media ===
[[Mass media]] plays an important role in shaping fitness culture because of the messages of an ideal [[body image]] they convey. Media such as TV, magazines and book publications, tend to promote ''slimness'' or even ''thinness'' as the ideal standards of female body image and ''slenderness'' or ''muscularity'' as the ideal male body image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/body-image-pressure-increasingly-affects-boys/283897/“Body-Image Pressure Increasingly Affects Boys] Jamie Santa Cruz. 2014, The Atlantic&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial advertisements have also created an influential and powerful force in promoting a stereotype of ideal body image which is not limited to fashion advertisements. Advertisements on commodities such as watches, [[smartphones]] and household appliances, have promoted an idealized body image of women and men as well. The perception of being slim and thin for women and slender and muscular for men became a stereotype in society, creating sociocultural pressures and influencing people to engage in fitness in order to pursuit the ideal body image promoted by the mass media.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brown, Kirsty. 1997. “From Fashion to Fitness? A Sociocultural Analysis of the Representation of Thinness within the Mass Media”. University of Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercising and dieting is often seen as the best way to achieve such ideal body image. For instance, fitness publications promote an idea that doing physical exercise is the natural medicine to your body and health.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. 2000. “The Commercialization of Discipline: Keep-fit Culture and its Values”. Journal of Modern Italian Studies, Volume 5, Issue 3, pp396–411&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, fashion magazines promote slimness and thinness as the ideal female image: to promote high fashion, models are usually slim and thin. There is also a significant increase of diet and weight loss articles in magazines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the shape of models has changed dramatically towards a “more tubular female form” in [[high fashion]] culture,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; often sparking controversies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jul/05/vogue-truth-size-zero-kirstie-clements Former Vogue editor: The truth about size zero] Kirstie Clements. 2013. The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer influence ===
People who regularly attend fitness institutions tend to make friends at these locations. They want to feel ''part of a group'', which can be referred to ''community feeling'', as the behaviour of group membership is transmitted from member to member within a group. However, this kind of friendship usually remains restricted within the fitness institution.&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, Nick. 2006. “In the Gym Motives, Meaning and Moral Careers”. Body and Society, Volume 12, No.3, pp23–50. SAGE Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the atmosphere in fitness institutions created by people with the same goal becomes a force of motivation. When people go to fitness institutions or start a new activity, they can be encouraged by others and give support to each other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition, fitness institutions can function as ''dating agencies'', creating chances to meet people apart from workplaces. Music, body movement and costumes of people exercising, can easily draw attention and become an occasion to engage with each other.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. 2010. Fitness Culture Gym: Gyms and the Commercialization of Discipline and Fun. Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of fitness culture is the gender differentiation in exercises performed. One study showed that women prefer to do cardiovascular exercise over weight training because it allows them to gain strength without transgressing norms for feminine physical appearance, whereas men prefer other exercises like bodybuilding or boxing in order to be more muscular.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Personal trainers ===
{{Main|Personal trainer}}
Fitness institutions are places where people can cultivate their individual needs in terms of keeping fit and having fun with other people. They have been developed as a ''commercial environment'' since 1980s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The concept beyond this commercial aspect can be explained by the idea of making the best use of time because people must pay for their membership in order to join a fitness institution. Thus, they are considered customers. Fitness institutions are trying to explore the market by providing extra services such as personal trainers, [[coaching|coaches]] and experts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Personal trainers act as representative roles that represent the fitness club. It is a kind of representation for customers in term of satisfaction and loyalty to that particular fitness institution. Trainers also act as brokers, or agents, to create a link between the activities of their customers and the purchase of extra goods and services that their customers need for particular activities such as shoes for specific training, clothing, or home equipment. Trainers are also motivators of the goods and services. They are required to have technical skills in order to provide professional fitness services to their customers and they need to have good communication skills meant to persuade their customers to do more in the fitness institution, which in turn means purchasing more goods and services. Finally, personal trainers also act as entrepreneurs:  creating a large network of customers for different goods and services in order to produce profits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From this point of view, personal trainers are intermediaries between customers and the fitness institution, playing a crucial role in the commercialization of fitness culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Maguire, Jennifer Smith. 2001. “Fit and Flexible: the Fitness Industry, Personal Trainers and Emotional Service Labor”. Sociology of Sport Journal, 18, pp379–402&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of personal trainers can be explained by the analysis of rule-governed behaviour in terms of evolutionary thinking. From this perspective, personal trainers act as speaker to give rules, while trainees are listeners to follow the rules. Much human behaviour starts out from rule-governed behaviour and switches to long-term control. Whether the trainees will continue the training depends on the reinforcement by following the rule of personal trainers, because being fit and bodily well-being is a long-term contingency of fitness activities.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, William M. 1995. “Rules, Culture and Fitness”. The Behavior Analyst, 18, pp1–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of personal trainers has also revealed a phenomenon which can be explained from the sociological perspective of "[[The Outsourced Self|outsourced-self]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 2012. The Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times. Metropolitan Books&lt;/ref&gt; This means “transferring our own responsibility to other”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Keeping healthy and well are people’s own responsibility, however people are hiring personal trainers to be responsible for it. It is also relevant to the perspective of "body work" in the [[Sociology of the body|sociology of body]]: people are outsourcing their own bodies to the paid workers in order to keep healthy and prevent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Gimlin, Debra. 2007. “What Is ‘Body Work’? A Review of the Literature”. Sociology Compass, Volume 1, Issue 1,  pp353–370&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport fashion ===
{{Main|Fitness fashion}}
Sport fashion is a product created by commercialization of fitness culture. As mentioned above, personal trainers also act as agents to sell different goods and services. An example is the case of Body Training System (BTS). BTS instructors are suggested to change their costume according to the programmes in order to show the differences in character. The aim is to aspire the trainees to purchase the same costume offered by the programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Felstead, Alan, Fuller, Alison, Jewson, Nick, Kakavelakis, Konstantinos and Unwin, Lorna. 2007. “Grooving to the Same Tunes? Learning, Training and Productive Systems in the Aerobics Studio”. Work, Employment &amp; Society, Volume 21(2): pp189–208. SAGE Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, sport wear and [[athletic footwear]] has become the fastest growing segment in the apparel market.  The trend in sport wear frames it not only for sport activities but also as daywear or weekend wear. While classic sport brands continue to expand their market share in the industry, high fashion brands have also joined the competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashionista.com/2014/05/fitness-fashion-trend-2014 Why Fitness is Having a Moment in Fashion] Vingan, Alyssa. 2014.

The '''Football War''' ({{lang-es|La guerra del fútbol}}; [[colloquial]]: '''Soccer War''' or the '''100 Hours War''') was a brief [[war]] fought between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.

==Context==
Although the nickname "Football War" implies that the conflict was due to a football match, the causes of the war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in [[Honduras]] and immigration and demographic problems in [[El Salvador]]. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 Salvadorans were living in Honduras. These Salvadorans made up 20% of the present population of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, Allison. ''Honduras: The Making of a Banana Republic''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The [[United Fruit Company]] owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966  United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create la Federación Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras (FENAGH; the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras). FENAGH was anti-peasantry (against the [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]) as well as anti-Salvadoran. This group put pressure on the Honduran president, Gen. [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], to protect the property rights of wealthy landowners.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|64-75}}

In 1962 Honduras successfully enacted a new [[land reform]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/Honduras/pdfs/155709-206648.pdf|title=La Gaceta Dec. 5, 1962 (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans as specified by the Land Reform Law. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.

==Buildup==
In June 1969, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in a two-leg [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won {{nowrap|1–0}}. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816-1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 1969, the day the play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690628&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en| "Soccer 'War' Won By El Salvador, 3-2]; Troops Still Alerted", ''Pittsburgh Press'', June 28, 1969, p1&lt;/ref&gt;, El Salvador dissolved all diplomatic ties with Honduras, stating that in the ten days since the game in El Salvador 11,700 Salvadorans had been forced to flee Honduras. It said that as Honduras had "done nothing to prevent murder, oppression, rape, plundering and the mass expulsion of Salvadoreans", there was little point in maintaining relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's diplomatic penalty|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 June 1969|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further claimed that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|105}} El Salvador won the decisive third game 3–2 after [[extra time]].

==War==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
Late in the afternoon of 14 July 1969, the concerted military action began. El Salvador was put on a blackout and the [[Salvadoran Air Force]], using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers, attacked targets inside Honduras. Salvadoran air-raid targets included [[Toncontín International Airport]], which left the [[Honduran Air Force]] unable to react quickly. The larger [[Salvadoran Army]] launched major offensives along the two main roads connecting the two nations and invaded Honduras. The invasion phase was perpetrated by three main contingents: the Chalatenago Theater, the North Theater, and the East Theater. The Chalatenango Theater was based on the northwest side of El Salvador, including the departments of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], across the mountain range close to the border, and the [[Sumpul River]]. This was a strategic region due to its rich soil and climate; however, this Theater would not see any fighting as it was to deploy only in case of Honduran penetration into El Salvador. The North Theater was composed of a small unit of armored vehicles and a large amount of manpower. The East Theater was to deploy in the departments of [[La Unión Department|La Unión]] and [[Morazán Department|Morazán]]. This Theater was composed of a large mechanized division, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s such as the [[M3 Stuart]] and a large amount of artillery such as the [[105mm M101]].

Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] helped Honduras by providing weapons and ammunition{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Initially, rapid progress was made by the Salvadoran army. By the evening of 15 July, the [[Military of Honduras|Honduran army]] had been pushed back over eight kilometers. The departmental capital of [[Nueva Ocotepeque]] fell shortly after along with eight other cities, placing the Salvadoran army within striking distance of the Honduran capital [[Tegucigalpa]]. The momentum of the advance did not last, however.

The Honduran air force reacted by striking the Salvadoran [[Ilopango International Airport|Ilopango airbase]]. Honduran bombers attacked for the first time in the morning of 16 July. When the bombs began to fall, Salvadoran anti-air artillery started firing, repelling some of the bombers. The bombers had orders to attack the [[Acajutla]] Port, where the main oil facilities of El Salvador were based. Honduran air-raid targets also included minor oil facilities such as the ones in {{illm|Cutuco|es|Puerto Cutuco|ceb|Puerto Cutuco}}. By the evening of 16 July, huge pillars of smoke arose in the Salvadoran coastline from the burning oil depots that had been bombed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Both sides deployed [[World War II]] era design aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Spencer C. |editor-last=Tucker |title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2009 |page=2463}}&lt;/ref&gt; All planes in the engagement were of U.S. origin.  [[North American P-51|Cavalier P-51D Mustangs]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U-1, -4 and -5 Corsairs]], [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28A Trojans]], [[North American T-6 Texan|AT-6C Texans]] and even [[Douglas C-47|C-47 Skytrains]] converted into bombers saw action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overall |first=Mario |title=The Hundred Hour War: Honduras versus El Salvador |journal=[[Air Enthusiast]] |issue=118 |date=July–August 2005 |pages=8–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, Honduran Vought F4U Corsairs engaged a flight of Salvadorian Goodyear FG-1D Corsairs and Cavalier Mustangs — militarized versions of civilian air racing P-51s. During the duel, a Honduran pilot named Fernando Soto shot down three of the Salvadorian planes. El Salvador continued to fly its surviving Corsairs into 1975; Honduras didn’t retire its fleet until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/10/16/the-last-gunfighters-historys-final-piston-engine-interceptors/|title=The Last Gunfighters – History’s Final Piston-Engine Interceptors|website=Military History Now|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war was the last conflict in which piston-engined fighters fought each other.

==Cease-fire==
The Honduran government called on the OAS to intervene, fearing that the nearing Salvadoran Army would invade the capital Tegucigalpa. The OAS met in an urgent session on 15 July and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July; it took full effect only on 20 July. El Salvador continued until 29 July to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.

==Withdrawal==
[[File:Lynn Garrison F4U-7 Corsair 133693 N693M.png|thumb| F4U Corsair, one of the piston types flown in the war]] 
[[El Salvador]] finally withdrew its troops on 2 August 1969. On that date, [[Honduras]] guaranteed Salvadoran President [[Fidel Sánchez Hernández]] that the Honduran government would provide adequate safety for the Salvadorans still living in Honduras. Sánchez had also asked that reparations be paid to the Salvadoran citizens as well, but that was never accepted by Hondurans. There were also heavy pressures from the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the debilitating repercussions that would take place if El Salvador continued to resist withdrawing their troops from Honduras.

==Consequences==
Both sides of the Football War suffered extensive casualties. Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced, many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|145-155}}

El Salvador suffered about 900 mostly civilian dead. Honduras lost 250 combat troops, and over 2,000 civilians during the four-day war. Most of the war was fought on Honduran soil and thousands more were made homeless. Trade between Honduras and El Salvador had been greatly disrupted, and the border officially closed. This damaged the economies of these nations tremendously and threatened the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM).
*The war resulted in a 22-year suspension of the CACM, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the [[Cuban Revolution]].
*The political power of the military in both countries was reinforced. In the Salvadoran legislative elections that followed, candidates of the governing [[National Conciliation Party]] (''Partido de Conciliación Nacional'', PCN), were largely drawn from the ranks of the military. Having apologized for their role in the conflict, they proved very successful in elections at the national and local levels. In contrast to the gradual democratization process that had characterized the 1960s, the military establishment would exercise increasing control
*The social situation in El Salvador worsened, as the government proved unable to satisfy the economic needs of its citizens deported from Honduras. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the [[El Salvador Civil War]], which followed approximately a decade later

==Aftermath==
Eleven years after the war the two nations signed a peace treaty on 30 October 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/El_Salvador/pdfs/12624-26952.pdf |title=Diario Oficial Nov. 13, 1980(Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and five sections of land boundary through the [[International Court of Justice]]. In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court's ruling was around {{convert|374.5|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of [[Tiger Island|El Tigre]], and El Salvador over the islands of [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera]] and Meanguerita.&lt;ref name="Kawas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kawas, Jorge|title=El Salvador: Sovereignty issues over Gulf of Fonseca|date=18 March 2013|work=Pulsa Merica|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President [[Porfirio Lobo]] of Honduras, President [[Otto Pérez]] of Guatemala, and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting.  However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.&lt;ref name="Kawas" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">The '''Indian dribble''' is a [[field hockey]] technique, first appearing at the [[Field hockey at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]]. It consists of pushing the ball rapidly from right to left and then from left to right repeatedly by turning the hockey stick. Once mastered, it is a very good way to beat your opponent, as a player using Indian dribble is hard to defend against. It was named after the superb dribbling skills of the Indian and Pakistani teams.

==History==
It was introduced by the [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian]] and the [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistani]] teams. This new technique was one of the key points that helped these countries lead the field hockey world at that time. Until the mid-1950s playing the ball on the right hand side was dominant but this changed following a tour by the [[Germany|German]] National team to Pakistan. In 1954 players studied the Pakistan methods for four weeks, analysing their individual skills at controlling the ball in front of the body. As a result, the “Indian Dribble“ and the shorter Asian blade of sticks were introduced to the German game. Due to the changed position of the ball, and with the help of new blades, players’ behaviour was less predictable. They had a greater variety of passing and deception options.

A new skill in 1950s, it is now a basic technique in field hockey.

In the 1980s astro-turf was introduced and it was used for hockey. It was then easier for other nationalities to master the techniques. It is used in many ways when playing hockey matches.

==Remarkable Players==
'''Major Dhyan Chand''', who to some people is the best field hockey player in history, is well remembered and known for his ability at executing the dribbling. Back in the day, his wooden stick was cut in half just to check that there were no magnets or illegal enhancements that were allowing him to play like that.

'''Shahbaz Ahmed''' is one of the best dribblers in history. His skills were so fast that he is still remembered because of that. His generation was able to achieve many victories for Pakistan.

'''Luciana Aymar''', probably the best female player in history. She was selected 8 times as the FIH Player of the Year. She was able to execute the basic and most fundamental field hockey skills and tricks at a speed like no other.

==Skill==
* The left hand turns the stick while the right hand guides.
* Bring the ball with the hook of the stick from the forehand to the backhand and, using the tip, back again.
* Make sure that the stick turns over the ball: across the front of the ball and not behind the ball.
* Keep the ball in front of the body.
*Roll the ball and pass though the canter of legs in own opponent player

[[Image:Triathlon, swimming.jpeg|thumb|Triathletes begin the swimming stage of the 12th World Military Triathlon.]]
A '''multisport competition''' is a family of [[sport|athletic]] competitions in which athletes race in a continuous series of stages or "legs", and rapidly switch from one athletic discipline to another in order to achieve the best overall time.   Most multisport events are [[endurance]] races, consisting of [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities such as [[bicycle racing|cycling]],
[[running]], [[kayaking]] and [[cross-country skiing]].

Familiar events from the [[Olympic Games]] such as the [[pentathlon]], [[heptathlon]], [[octathlon]], [[decathlon]], and [[modern pentathlon]] are not usually considered to fall in this category because their individual components are not held back-to-back.

==Standard multisport events==
The world of multisport competitions has grown from the older and more traditional [[triathlon]] and [[duathlon]] competitions, and today includes a large number of variations.   There is quite a bit of variation in the naming of these events; the more common and most standardized names are listed here.

[[Adventure racing]] includes races which comprise a number of different stages of different types.  In many adventure races, the competitors do not know some or all of the stages before the race, and must handle unexpected challenges. A team normally consists of 4 people with at least 1 female. All team members must stay together at all times.

== Related events ==
[[Biathlon]], which consists of alternating stages of [[cross-country skiing]] and [[shooting]] is often confused with duathlon because of the similarity in names.  Some consider biathlon to be a form of multisport event, while others exclude it from the category because the athlete's score includes shooting accuracy in addition to total race time.

[[Coast to Coast (race)|Coast to Coast]], a multisport race held in New Zealand's South Island. Starting at Kumara Beach on the Tasman Sea and finishing at [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] Beach on the Pacific Ocean, the {{convert|243|km|mi|abbr=on}} race involves a 3&amp;nbsp;km run, a 55&amp;nbsp;km cycle, a 33&amp;nbsp;km mountain run, a 15&amp;nbsp;km cycle, a 67&amp;nbsp;km kayak, and a 70&amp;nbsp;km cycle.  The ''Longest Day'' is considered the ''World Champion'' for this type of non-standard multisport race.

There are also three military multisports, mainly participated in by militaries at the [[World Military Games]] and world championships: [[Aeronautical pentathlon]], [[Military pentathlon]], and [[Naval pentathlon]].

A '''personal seat license''', or '''PSL''', is a paid license that entitles the holder to the right to buy [[season ticket]]s for a certain seat in a [[stadium]]. This holder can sell the seat license to someone else if they no longer wish to purchase season tickets.&lt;ref name="ravenpsl"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-06-25/news/0906240127_1_ravens-psls-seat-licenses Barker, Jeff. "Owning a Ravens seat can pay off big time," ''The Baltimore Sun'', Thursday, June 25, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the seat license holder chooses not to sell the seat licenses and does not renew the season tickets, the holder forfeits the license back to the team. Most seat licenses are valid for as long as the team plays in the current venue.

As each PSL corresponds to a specific seat, the venue operator can charge different prices for each individual seat. From the fan's perspective, having a specific seat removed the necessity of searching for an open seat in a filled stadium. Also, fans can become friends with other people who also have PSLs in neighboring seats. Newly-built sporting venues often offer PSLs to help pay the debt incurred during the construction of the venue. Opponents of PSLs see this as another way to increase the price that fans must afford to attend the venue.

Seat licenses have been given various names. The most common term in [[North America]] is personal seat license and in [[Europe]] is [[debenture (sport)|debenture]].

==Origin of seat licenses==
There are varying accounts as to the origin of the personal seat license.  

According to one account, the first personal seat license plan was developed in 1986 at [[Stanford University]] by legendary tennis coach [[Dick Gould]].&lt;ref name=Stan&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Gould profile|publisher=Stanford University|url=http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-tennis/mtt/gould_dick00.html|accessdate=2009-11-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005214940/http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-tennis/mtt/gould_dick00.html|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Dickey|title=Gould Serves Up New Ideas|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2000-04-07|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/2000/04/07/SP35080.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeking financing for a new tennis stadium, Gould came up with the idea of selling the rights to seats, a licensing plan under which purchaser's name is engraved in the seat, and the purchaser owns the right to have first choice for tickets for any event held in the stadium.&lt;ref name=SF/&gt;

According to a second account, the permanent seat license was invented by a [[Columbus, Ohio]] architect, Rick Ohanian, in January 1987. Ohanian described his plan in a ''Letter to The Editor'' of the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', published on March 2, 1987, entitled "Ticketbond is Answer to Financing Proposed Facility".&lt;ref name="jhespnpsl"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hill/080801&amp;sportCat=nfl Hill, Jemele. "Personal seat licenses, rising ticket prices spell doom," ESPN Page 2, Monday, August 4, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a third account, the permanent seat license was invented by [[Charlotte]] sports marketing agent Max Muhleman, in 1993. Muhleman is credited as the founder of the first PSLs at Charlotte's then [[Bank of America Stadium|Carolinas Stadium]]. The idea began as "Charter Seat Rights”, an idea Muhleman suggested to [[New Orleans Pelicans|Charlotte Hornets]] owner [[George Shinn]] as a way to reward those who bought season tickets and helped Shinn get the team in the 1980s. The Hornets' season ticket holders received these rights for free, but people sold them like a [[commodity]]. This gave Muhleman the idea to use a similar concept, which fans would pay for, to finance the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/scott-fowler/article195474309.html|title=The ‘P’ in PSL stands for ‘permanent,’ but Panthers fans wonder if that will be true|last=Fowler|first=Scott|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1969, the Dallas Cowboys used stadium bonds to finance the construction of [[Texas Stadium]] in Irving. The purchase of the bond entitled the bond holder to purchase season tickets for the Cowboys.&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.wfaa.com/story/news/local/2014/08/06/13434040/&lt;/ref&gt;

Others cite similar programs that were in existence among many college fund raising activities prior to 1987. However, the early programs were tax-deductible donations to a scholarship fund, in which case the main "quid-pro-quo" was between the donation and the resultant deduction, not between the donation and the actual seating rights.

==Sports teams and organizations employing seat licenses==
Some of the teams that have seat licenses include:

===Car Racing Seat Licenses===
*[[Auto Club Speedway]] PSL
*[[Circuit of the Americas]] PSL
*[[Kentucky Speedway]] PSL
*[[Texas Motor Speedway]] PSL

*[[Charlotte Hornets]] PSL
* [[Golden State Warriors]] Membership
** Instituted in 2017 for all season tickets at the team's future home of [[Chase Center (San Francisco)|Chase Center]], opening in 2019. The Warriors became the first NBA team with a broad-based PSL. The PSL, which runs for 30 years, can either be given back to the team or transferred at any time, although it cannot be sold for more than its face value, prorated for the number of years remaining on the license. At the end of the license period, the face value of the license will be returned to the original owner (or heirs) if it has never been transferred. If the license is transferred, the team must be notified of the price; if the price paid falls short of the full price less payments already made, the team will return the difference to the original owner at the end of the license period. The PSL operates as an interest-free loan to the team.&lt;ref name="Warriors PSL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20108213/golden-state-warriors-become-1st-nba-team-charge-personal-seat-licenses-new-arena |title=Warriors to become first NBA team with broad use of personal seat licenses |first=Darren |last=Rovell |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rapha Performance Roadwear''' is a [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] and lifestyle brand focused on [[road bicycle racing]], clothing and accessories. Rapha headquarters are in [[London]] with a United States office in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Company|url=http://pages.rapha.cc/service/about-rapha/the-company|publisher=Rapha|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was started in [[London]] in early 2004 by [[Simon Mottram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn|first=Rob|title=Pedalling fashion: the rise of cycle style|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/hot-50-supplement/hot-50-rapha/|publisher=Design Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luke Scheybeler]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Lucie|title=New sportswear line|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a6984224-546b-11e4-b2ea-00144feab7de|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first products were launched in July of that year. The name Rapha was taken from the 1960s cycling team [[Rapha (cycling team)|Rapha]], which was named after the [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] drink company Saint Raphaël.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Original Rapha|url=http://inrng.com/2012/05/original-rapha-history/|work=The Inner Ring|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rapha partnered with British designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] to create a range of limited-edition cycle clothing and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapha + Paul Smith collection unveiled|url=http://roadcyclinguk.com/news/gear-news/rapha-paul-smith-collection-unveiled.html|work=Road Cycling UK|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Rapha collaborated with bikepacking design pioneer Apidura on a limited range of cycling luggage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cyclingindustry.news/rapha-partners-apidura-for-bar-and-saddlebag-line/|title=Rapha partners Apidura for bar and saddlebag line|date=2016-06-15|work=Cycling Industry News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Rapha clothing is produced in a number of different locations including the UK, Italy and the Far East. UK production included some early Merino wool pieces and also leather gloves which are made in Somerset, England. Italian production focuses on stretch fabric and stretch garments such as shorts and tights. In China production focuses on the most technical items, such as outerwear.

In recent years, Rapha has developed an international cycling club, in which members have access to exclusive club apparel and high-end bike rentals (currently supplied by [[Canyon Bicycles]]).  The Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) hosts rides and events at stores known as Clubhouses in 21 international locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia.  Each clubhouse consists of a retail space that sells Rapha apparel and accessories, as well as a cafe that serves coffee and food while screening live cycle racing.  Clubhouses also play host to a number of cycling-related events and art exhibitions throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/clubs&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, it was announced that Rapha would be purchased by RZC Investments, a company setup by [[Steuart Walton]], for £200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart heirs' fund wins £200m race for cycling brand Rapha|url=http://news.sky.com/story/walmart-heirs-fund-wins-200m-race-for-cycling-brand-rapha-10978288|accessdate=7 August 2017|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Rapha used to co-own the UK-based cycling team {{ct|RCS|2014}} with London bike brand [[Condor Cycles]] and the [[cyclocross]] team Rapha Focus; at the end of 2014 Rapha announced they would end their grassroots sponsorship to focus on Team Sky and {{ct|WGN}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427233133/http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2012, it was announced that as of 2013, Rapha would be producing the clothing for the British cycling team, {{ct|SKY|2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Jamie|title=Sky's the limit for cult clothing brand Rapha|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/skys-the-limit-for-cult-clothing-brand-rapha-8101496.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian Cyclocross champion for 2013 and 2014, Lisa Jacobs, chooses to wear Rapha clothing.
On November 3, 2015, Rapha announced that their {{ct|SKY|2016}} sponsorship would end after the 2016 season.  In an effort to grow and promote women's cycling, Rapha began supplying clothing to the [[UCI Women's WorldTour]] team [[Canyon-SRAM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/feature/canyon-sram-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ring announcer''' is an in-ring (and sometimes on-camera) employee or contractor for a [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]] or [[mixed martial arts]] event or promotion, who introduces the competitors to the audience.

In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring. In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a "big fight feel".

The ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.

When an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.

In professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.

Even further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains.

In a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.

A '''stadium''' (plural '''stadiums''' or '''stadia''')&lt;ref&gt;''Stadia'' is the [[Latin]] plural form, but both are used in English. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stadium Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nussli Group]] [https://archive.is/20120905020454/http://www.nussli.com/en/projects/stadium-construction.html?_r=1&amp;hp "Stadium Construction Projects"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias]] noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the [[Stadion (unit)|stade]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], where the word "stadium" originated.&lt;ref name="David C. Young p. 20"&gt;''A Brief History of the Olympic Games'' by David C. Young, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for [[association football]]. Other popular stadium sports include [[gridiron football]], baseball, ice hockey, basketball, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, Australian-rules football, Gaelic football, rugby sevens, field lacrosse, bandy, athletics, hurling, field hockey, Kabaddi, and bullfighting. A large number of large sports venues are also used for concerts. Basketball is the most popular arena (or indoor stadium) sport in the world. Large race circuits and large horse racing tracks are not stadiums, but sports venues, because the entire playing surface can't be seen from the stands. For the difference, compare [[List of stadiums by capacity]] with [[List of sports venues by capacity]].

==Etymology==
[[File:OlympicRaceTrackOlympia.JPG|thumb|[[Stadium at Olympia]]]]
"Stadium" is the [[Latin]] form of the Greek word "[[Stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]" (''στάδιον''), a measure of length equalling the length of 600 human feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsta%2Fdion Στάδιον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; As feet are of variable length the exact length of a stadion depends on the exact length adopted for 1 foot at a given place and time. Although in modern terms 1 stadion = {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}}, in a given historical context it may actually signify a length up to 15% larger or smaller.&lt;ref name="David C. Young p. 20"/&gt;

The equivalent Roman measure, the [[Stadion (unit of length)|stadium]], had a similar length&amp;nbsp;– about {{convert|185|m|ft|abbr=on}} – but instead of being defined in feet was defined using the Roman standard [[Pace (unit)|passus]] to be a distance of 125 ''passūs'' (double-paces).

The English use of ''stadium'' comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a Roman track of such length.

Most dictionaries provide for both ''stadiums'' and ''stadia'' as valid English plurals, although [[Etymology|etymological]] purists sometimes apply ''stadia'' only to measures of length in excess of 1 stadium.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
[[File:Kallimarmaron stadium.JPG|thumb|[[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]
The oldest known stadium is the one in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], in the western [[Peloponnese]], Greece, where the [[Olympic Games]] of antiquity were held from 776 BC. Initially 'the Games' consisted of a ''single event'', a sprint along the length of the stadium. The ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]'', a measure of length, may be related to the "Stadium", but the track at the [[Stadium at Olympia]] is longer than the conventional ''stadion''.
&lt;!--
The following does not appear to be true:
"Therefore the length of Olympia's stadium became somewhat of a standard measure of distance."
The measure of distance appears to have been defined independently of the length of Olympia's stadium
--&gt;
Greek and Roman stadiums have been found in numerous ancient cities, perhaps the most famous being the [[Stadium of Domitian]], in Rome.

The excavated and refurbished ancient [[Panathenaic stadium]] hosted an early version of the Olympic Games in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Olympic Games, A Struggle for Revival'' by David C. Young, Chapters 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt; 1875, 1896 and 1906. The excavation and refurbishment of the stadium was part of the legacy of the Greek national benefactor [[Evangelos Zappas]], and it was the first ancient stadium to be used in modern times.

===Modern stadiums===

The first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities, designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible. With tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late [[Victorian era]], especially [[association football]] in the United Kingdom and [[baseball]] in the United States, the first such structures were built.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/architecture/historic_stadiums.shtml|title=Stadium History}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such early stadium was the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road Stadium]], the brainchild of [[Henry Dunlop]], who organised the first All Ireland [[Athletics (track and field)|Athletics]] Championships. Banned from locating sporting events at Trinity College, Dunlop built the stadium in 1872. "I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a Lansdowne archery club, a Lansdowne cricket club, and last, but not least, the [[Lansdowne Football Club|Lansdowne Rugby Football Club]] – colours red, black and yellow." Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to use his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland.

Other early stadiums from this period in the UK include the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge stadium]] (opened in 1877 for the [[London Athletic Club]]) and [[Anfield|Anfield stadium]] (1884 as a venue for [[Everton F.C.]]).

In the U.S., many professional baseball teams built [[Baseball park#Wooden ballparks|large stadiums mainly out of wood]], with the first such venue being the [[South End Grounds]] in [[Boston]], opened in 1871 for the team then known as the Boston Beaneaters (now the [[Atlanta Braves]]). However, many of these parks caught fire, and even those that did not burn proved inadequate for a growing game. All of the 19th-century wooden parks were replaced, some after only a few years, and none survive today.

[[Goodison Park]] was the first purpose-built football stadium in the world. [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]]-based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested.&lt;ref name="School of Science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbett|first=James|title=School of Science|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4050-3431-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of £150 and 12 [[turnstile]]s were installed at a cost of £7 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertoncollection.org.uk/exhibitions/the+anfield+split+%252d+the+move+to+goodison?p=5#foot|title=The Move to Goodison|publisher=Everton Collection|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short [[track and field athletics|athletics]] event followed by music and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="School of Science"/&gt; Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-history.asp|title=History of Goodison Park|publisher=ToffeeWeb|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Archibald Leitch]] brought his experience with the construction of industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country. His work encompassed the first 40 years of the 20th century. One of his most notable designs was [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester. The ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |pages=234–235|location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first stadium to feature continuous seating along the contours of the stadium.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums" /&gt;

These early venues, originally designed to host football matches, were adopted for use by the Olympic Games, the first one being held in 1896 in [[Athens]], Greece. The [[White City Stadium]], built for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London is often cited as the first modern seater stadium, at least in the UK. Designed by the engineer [[John Webster|J.J. Webster]] and completed in 10 months by [[George Wimpey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Valerie|last= White|title=Wimpey: The first hundred years|publisher=George Wimpey|date=1980|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of the [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]], this stadium with a [[seating capacity]] of 68,000 was opened by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] on 27 April 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C. Frank |date=Summer 1992 | title = A Look at Olympic Costs | journal = Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–32 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n1/JOHv1n1f.pdf | accessdate =24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the stadium had a running track {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}} and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|660|yd|m|adj=on}} cycle track. The infield included a swimming and diving pool. The [[Arsenal Stadium|London Highbury Stadium]], built in 1913, was the first stadium in the UK to feature a two-tiered seating arrangement when it was redesigned in the [[Art Deco]] style in 1936.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums" /&gt;

During these decades, parallel stadium developments were taking place in the U.S. The [[Baker Bowl]], a baseball park in [[Philadelphia]] that opened in its original form in 1887 but was completely rebuilt in 1895, broke new ground in stadium construction in two major ways. The stadium's second incarnation featured the world's first cantilevered second deck (tier) in a sports venue, and was also the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction. Another influential venue was [[Boston]]'s [[Harvard Stadium]], built in 1903 by [[Harvard University]] for its [[Harvard Crimson football|American football team]] and track and field program. It was the world's first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction. In 1909, concrete-and-steel construction came to baseball with the opening of [[Shibe Park]] in Philadelphia and, a few months later, [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. The latter was the world's first three-tiered sporting venue. The opening of these parks marked the start of the [[Baseball park#Jewel box ballparks|"jewel box" era]] of park construction. The largest stadium crowd ever was 199,854 people watching [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|the final match]] of the [[1950 World Cup]] at [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]] on 16 July 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS BOOK|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=142|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ancient stadium==
[[File:Aphrodisias stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Aphrodisias#Stadium|Stadium at Aphrodisias]]]]
Stadiums in ancient Greece and Rome were built for different purposes, and at first only the Greeks built structures called "stadium"; Romans built structures called "Circus." Greek stadia were for foot races, whereas the Roman circus was for horse races. Both, however, had similar shapes and bowl-like areas around them for spectators. The Greeks also developed the theatre, with its seating arrangements foreshadowing those of modern stadiums. The Romans copied the theatre, then expanded it to accommodate larger crowds and more elaborate settings. The Romans also developed the double-sized round theatre called amphitheatre, seating crowds in the tens of thousands for gladiatorial combats and beast shows. The Greek stadium and theatre and the Roman circus and amphitheatre are all ancestral to the modern stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Alan|title=Circus Factions: Blues and Greens at Rome and Byzantium|date=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beare|first1=W.|title=The Roman Stage: A Short History of Latin Drama in the Time of the Republic|date=1950|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[Dome]]d stadiums are distinguished from conventional stadiums by their enclosing roofs. Many of these are not actually domes in the pure architectural sense, some being better described as [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], some having [[truss]]-supported roofs and others having more exotic designs such as a [[tensegrity|tensegrity structure]]. But, in the context of sports stadiums, the term "dome" has become standard for all covered stadiums,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dome Dome]", Merriam-Webster&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because the first such enclosed stadium, the [[Houston Astrodome]], was built with an actual dome-shaped roof. Some stadiums have partial roofs, and a few have even been designed to have moveable fields as part of the infrastructure. The [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]] is a true dome structure made of a [[Lamellar structure|lamellar multi-ringed frame]] and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m). It is the largest fixed domed structure in the world.&lt;ref name=SBBBC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parry|first1=Haydn|title=Super Bowl XLVII: New Orleans' pride restored after Katrina|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/american-football/21292257|website=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though enclosed, dome stadiums are called ''stadiums'' because they are large enough for, and designed for, what are generally considered to be outdoor sports such as athletics, [[American football]], [[association football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], and [[baseball]]. Those designed for what are usually indoor sports like basketball, ice hockey and volleyball are generally called ''[[arena]]s''. Exceptions include:

* [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]], home to [[Duke University]]'s Blue Devils [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|men's]] and [[Duke Blue Devils women's basketball|women's]] basketball programs
* [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]], an open-air venue that is home to [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[New York Red Bulls]]
* [[Paris La Défense Arena]], a domed stadium that is home to the rugby union club [[Racing 92]]
* [[Chicago Stadium]] (demolished), former home to the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Chicago Bulls]]

===Design issues===
{{See also|Multi-purpose stadium#Criticisms}}
Different sports require fields of different size and shape. Some stadiums are designed primarily for a single sport while others can accommodate different events, particularly ones with [[movable seating|retractable seating]]. Stadiums built specifically for association football are quite common in Europe; however, [[Gaelic games]] stadiums (such as the incomplete [[Croke Park]]) would be most common in Ireland, while ones built specifically for [[baseball]] or [[American football]] are common in the United States. The most common [[multi-purpose stadium|multiple use design]] combines a football pitch with a [[running track]], a combination which generally works fairly well, although certain compromises must be made. The major drawback is that the stands are necessarily set back a good distance from the pitch, especially at the ends of the pitch. In the case of some smaller stadiums, there are not stands at the ends. When there are stands all the way around, the stadium takes on an oval shape. When one end is open, the stadium has a horseshoe shape. All three configurations (open, oval and horseshoe) are common, especially in the case of American college football stadiums. Rectangular stadiums are more common in Europe, especially for football where many stadiums have four often distinct and very different stands on the four sides of the stadium. These are often all of different sizes and designs and have been erected at different periods in the stadium's history. The vastly differing character of European football stadiums has led to the growing hobby of ground hopping where spectators make a journey to visit the stadium for itself rather than for the event held there. In recent years the trend of building completely new oval stadiums in Europe has led to traditionalists criticising the designs as bland and lacking in the character of the old stadiums they replace.

In North America, where baseball and American football are the two most popular outdoor spectator sports, a number of football/baseball multi-use stadiums were built, especially during the 1960s, and some of them were successful.

However, since the requirements for baseball and football are significantly different, the trend has been toward the construction of single-purpose stadiums, beginning with [[Truman Sports Complex|Kansas City in 1972–1973]] and accelerating in the 1990s. In several cases, an American football stadium has been constructed adjacent to a [[baseball park]], to allow for the sharing of mutual parking lots and other amenities. With the rise of MLS, the construction of [[soccer-specific stadium]]s has also increased since the late 1990s to better fit the needs of that sport. In many cases, earlier baseball stadiums were constructed to fit into a particular land area or city block. This resulted in asymmetrical dimensions for many baseball fields. [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], for example, was built on a triangular city block in [[The Bronx]], New York City. This resulted in a large left field dimension but a small right field dimension.

Before more modern football stadiums were built in the United States, many baseball parks, including [[Fenway Park]], the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Wrigley Field]], [[Comiskey Park]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], [[Griffith Stadium]], [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], [[Shibe Park]], [[Forbes Field]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and [[Sportsman's Park]] were used by the [[National Football League]] or the [[American Football League]]. (To a certain extent, this continues in lower football leagues as well, with [[TD Ameritrade Park]] being used as the home stadium of the United Football League's [[Omaha Nighthawks]].) Along with today's single use stadiums is the trend for retro style ballparks closer to downtown areas. [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was the first such ballpark for [[Major League Baseball]] to be built, using early-20th-century styling with 21st-century amenities.

There is a solar-powered stadium in Taiwan that produces as much energy as it needs to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/20/taiwan-solar-stadium | title=Taiwan's solar stadium 100% powered by the sun | newspaper=The Guardian | date=20 May 2009 | author=Inhabitat | accessdate=2 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stadium designers often study acoustics to increase noise caused by fans' voices, aiming to create a lively atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22110898 | title=How do you give stadiums atmosphere? | first=Martin | last=Vennard | publisher=BBC News | date=13 April 2013 | accessdate=2 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lighting ====
[[File:Bramall Lane End.jpg|thumb|[[Bramall Lane]]]]
Until the advent of [[floodlights]], most games played on large areas had to rely on natural lighting.

[[Bramall Lane]] was reportedly the first floodlit stadium. Floodlighting in association football dates as far back as 1878, when there were floodlit experimental matches at [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]] during the dark winter afternoons. With no [[electrical grid|national grid]], lights were powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[dynamo]]es, and were unreliable.

Since the development of electrical grids, lighting has been an important element in stadium design, allowing games to be played after sundown, and in covered, or partly covered stadiums that allow less natural light, but provide more shelter for the public.

===Spectator areas and seating===
[[File:Hillsborough Stadium interior.jpg|thumb|[[Hillsborough Stadium]]]]
An [[all-seater stadium|"all-seater" stadium]] has seats for all spectators. Other stadiums are designed so that all or some spectators stand to view the event. The term "all-seater" is not common in the U.S., as very few American stadiums have sizeable standing-only sections. Poor stadium design has contributed to disasters, such as the [[Hillsborough disaster]] and the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Since these, all [[Premier League]], [[UEFA European Championship qualifying|UEFA European Championship]] and [[FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualifying matches]] require all spectators to be seated.

Seating areas may be known as ''terraces'',''tiers'', or ''decks''. Originally set out for standing room only, they are now usually equipped with seating. Another term used in the US is ''[[bleacher]]s'', which is mostly used for seating areas with bench seats as opposed to individual seats, and which often are uncovered; the name refers to the bleaching effect direct, unshaded  sunlight has on the benches and patrons in those sections.

Many stadiums make luxury suites or boxes available to patrons at high prices. These suites can accommodate fewer than 10 spectators or upwards of 30 depending on the venue. Luxury suites at events such as the [[Super Bowl]] can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

==== Safety and security ====
[[File:Ibrox Inside.jpg|thumb|[[Ibrox Stadium]]]]
[[File:Moscow-Exterior of Luzhniki Stadium (2).jpg|thumb|[[Luzhniki Stadium]]]]
{{See also|Category:Stadium disasters}}
Due to the number of people congregating in stadiums and the frequency of events, many notable accidents have occurred in the past, some causing injury and death. For example, the [[Hillsborough disaster]] was a [[human crush]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]], England on 15 April 1989. The resulting 96 fatalities and 766 injuries makes this the worst disaster in British sporting history.

Much effort has been spent to avoid the recurrence of such events, both in design and legislation. Especially where there is a perceived risk of [[terrorism]] or violence attention remains high to prevent human death and keep stadiums as places where families can enjoy a public event together.

In Europe and South America, during the twentieth century, it was common for violent bands of supporters to fight inside or close to association football stadiums. In the United Kingdom they are known as [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]].

Structural features that increase safety include separate entry and exit accesses for each spectator area, especially separating accesses for home and visitor supporters, dividing walls, glass parapets, vibration attenuation and sprinkler systems.

Security features that have been adopted include armed surveillance, [[Identity document]] checks, [[video surveillance]], [[metal detectors]] and security searches to enforce rules that forbid spectators to carry dangerous or potentially dangerous items.

===Political and economic issues===
[[File:Empire Field near empty.jpg|thumb|[[Empire Field]]]]
Modern stadiums, especially the largest among them, are [[megaprojects]] that can only be afforded by the largest corporations, wealthiest individuals, or government. Sports fans have a deep emotional attachment to their teams. In North America, with its closed-league "[[North American professional sports league organization|franchise]]" system, there are fewer teams than cities which would like them. This creates tremendous [[bargaining power]] for the owners of teams, whereby owners can threaten to relocate teams to other cities unless governments subsidize the construction of new facilities.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;Lambert, Craig.  "[http://harvardmagazine.com/2001/09/the-dow-of-professional.html The Dow of Professional Sports]" ''Harvard Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and Latin America, where there are multiple association football clubs in any given city, and several leagues in each country, no such monopoly power exists, and stadiums are built primarily with private money. Outside professional sports, governments are also involved through the intense competition for the right to host major sporting events, primarily the [[Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] (of association football), during which cities often pledge to build new stadiums on order to satisfy the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) or [[FIFA]].

===Environmental issues===
Modern stadiums bring several negative environmental issues with their construction. They require thousands of tons of materials to build, they greatly increase traffic in the area around the stadium, as well as maintaining the stadium&lt;ref&gt;www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2017/12/11/big-sports-events-have-big-environmental-footprints-could-social-licenses-to-operate-help/#439494ec50cf.&lt;/ref&gt;. The increased traffic around modern stadiums has led to create exposure zones says the Health Effect Institute, exposing 30-40% of people living around the stadium to potential health issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/elj/vol25/iss1/6|title=Green Monsters: Examining the Environmental Impact of Sports Stadiums|first=Grant Jr., Thomas|last=J.|date=9 August 2018|journal=Villanova Environmental Law Journal|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many stadiums are attempting to counteract these issues by implementing solar panels, and high efficiency lighting, to reduce their own carbon footprint.

====Corporate naming====

{{See also|Naming rights|List of sports venues with sole naming rights}}
In recent decades, to help take the burden of the massive expense of building and maintaining a stadium, many American and European sports teams have sold the rights to the name of the facility. This trend, which began in the 1970s, but accelerated greatly in the 1990s, has led to sponsors' names being affixed to both established stadiums and new ones. In some cases, the corporate name replaces (with varying degrees of success) the name by which the venue has been known for many years. But many of the more recently built stadiums, like the [[Volkswagen Arena]] in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, have never been known by a non-corporate name. The sponsorship phenomenon has since spread worldwide. There remain a few municipally owned stadiums, which are often known by a name that is significant to their area (for example, [[Minneapolis]]' [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]). In recent years, some government-owned stadiums have also been subject to naming-rights agreements, with some or all of the revenue often going to the team(s) that play there.

One consequence of corporate naming has been an increase in stadium name changes, when the namesake corporation changes its name, or if it is the naming agreement simply expires. Phoenix's [[Chase Field]], for example, was previously known as Bank One Ballpark, but was renamed to reflect the takeover of the latter corporation. San Francisco's historic [[Candlestick Park]] was renamed as [[3Com|3Com Park]] for several years, but the name was dropped when the sponsorship agreement expired, and it was another two years before the new name of [[Monster Cable Products]]' Monster Park was applied. Local opposition to the corporate naming of that particular stadium led San Francisco's city council to permanently restore the Candlestick Park name once the Monster contract expired. More recently, in Ireland, there has been huge opposition to the renaming of [[Dublin]]'s historic [[Lansdowne Road]] as the [[Aviva Stadium]]. Lansdowne was redeveloped as the Aviva, opening in May 2010.

On the other hand, Los Angeles' [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Great Western Forum]], one of the earliest examples of corporate renaming, retained its name for many years, even after the namesake bank no longer existed, the corporate name being dropped only after the building later changed ownership. This practice has typically been less common in countries outside the United States. A notable exception is the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] league of Japan, in which many of the teams are themselves named after their parent corporations. Also, many newer European football stadiums, such as the [[Macron Stadium|Macron]] and [[Emirates Stadium]]s in England and [[Westfalenstadion|Signal Iduna Park]] and [[Allianz Arena]] in Germany have been corporately named.

This new trend in corporate naming (or renaming) is distinguishable from names of some older venues, such as [[Crosley Field]], [[Wrigley Field]], and the first and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|second Busch Stadiums]], in that the parks were named by and for the club's owner, which also happened to be the name of the company owned by those clubowners. (The current [[Busch Stadium]] received its name via a modern naming rights agreement.) SkyDome in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada was renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005, removing any reference that it is a domed stadium.

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, some stadiums were temporarily renamed because [[FIFA]] prohibits sponsorship of stadiums. For example, the [[Allianz Arena]] in Munich was called the ''FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich'' during the tournament. Likewise, the same stadium will be known as the "München Arena" during the European Competitions. Similar rules affect the [[Imtech Arena]] and [[Veltins-Arena]]. This rule applies even if the stadium sponsor is an official FIFA sponsor—the Johannesburg stadium then commercially known as "Coca-Cola Park", bearing the name of [[The Coca-Cola Company|one of FIFA's major sponsors]], was known by its historic name of [[Ellis Park Stadium]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Corporate names are also temporarily replaced during the Olympics.

===Music venues===
{{Main|Arena rock|l1=Stadium rock}}
Although concerts such as for classical music had been presented there for decades, from the 1960s stadiums began to be used as live venues for popular music, giving rise to the term "[[arena rock]]" or "stadium rock", particularly for forms of [[hard rock]] and [[progressive rock]]. The origins of stadium rock are sometimes dated to when [[The Beatles]] [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour#The Shea Stadium show|played]] [[Shea Stadium]] in New York in 1965. Also important was the use of large stadiums for American tours by bands in the later 1960s, such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. The tendency developed in the mid-1970s as the increased power of amplification and sound systems allowed the use of larger and larger venues.&lt;ref name=Waksman2009&gt;S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5414">In British [[sports]], a '''supporters' trust''' is a formal, democratic and [[not-for-profit]] organisation of [[Fan (person)|fans]] who attempt to strengthen the influence of supporters over the running of the club they support. There are over 140 supporters' trusts across [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] and the majority of these are affiliated to [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs, however trusts also exist for [[Rugby League]] and [[Rugby Union]] clubs.

With [[government]] and with cross-party support, [[Supporters Direct]] was established to encourage the formation of supporters' trusts to promote democratic supporter ownership. Supporters Direct encourages these bodies to be formed as [[Industrial and provident society|Industrial and Provident Societies (IPSs)]] and assists with their formation, legal and start-up costs.

Supporters' trusts were commonly founded in response to a financial crisis which threatens the future of a team, as was the case at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] [[York City F.C.|York City]], and [[Real Oviedo]]. Their involvement has reportedly ensured the survival of over 20 different clubs entering into administration, particularly during the period of crisis as a result of the collapse of [[ITV Digital]]. Supporters' trusts are now more commonly founded in order to increase influence at clubs through a financial stake in the club.

The first trust established was at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in January 1992. The largest is the [[Manchester United Supporters Trust]], which used to be known as Shareholders United and currently has over 200,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://action.joinmust.org/index.php/content/splash |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303160040/http://action.joinmust.org/index.php/content/splash |archivedate=2010-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large trusts such as [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]], [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Glasgow Rangers]] have between 3,000 and 7,000 members.

== Methods for influencing clubs ==
The main objective of a supporters' trust is to provide a vehicle for fans to influence the running of their club.  This is achieved by a number of different strategies, including gaining control by fundraising to finance the acquisition of [[shares]] in the club or direct board representation.

=== Club ownership ===
{{see also|List of fan-owned sports teams}}
The most effective method of influencing the running of a club is club ownership.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  In the UK more than 110 supporters' trusts currently hold equity within their football clubs while supporters' trusts have outright or majority ownership or control at two [[The Football League|Football League]] and others.

=== Board representation ===
Over 40 football clubs currently have supporter representation within the boards of their football clubs, such as the [[Rangers Supporters Trust]] at [[Rangers F.C.]], [[Lincoln City Supporters' Trust]] at [[Lincoln City F.C.]], [[ArabTRUST]] at [[Dundee United F.C.]], the [[Trust Oldham|Oldham Athletic Supporters Trust]] and the [http://www.swanstrust.com/ Swans Trust] at [[Swansea City A.F.C.]]. The Bluebirds Trust at [[Barrow AFC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/bluebirdstrust/&lt;/ref&gt; have a board representation and are fundraising to purchase shares. However their formation is different to the vast majority of Trusts, they are not born from crisis but success; Barrow AFC were a members owned club but voted to become a privately owned club. Barrow born Texan businessman Paul Casson of Casson-Mark (C-Mark) Corp. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.barrowafc.com/fa-confirms-paul-cassons-takeover/&lt;/ref&gt; purchased the club in the Summer of 2014. In Real Oviedo's case, when the club whas about to go bankrupt, the club started putting shares up for sale to people across the world to help the club. Thousand of people invested, including 2nd richest man [[Carlos Slim]] and Youtuber Spencer Owen (aka Spencer F.C). As was the case for [[Ebbsfleet United]].

About 100 football trusts currently have shares in their clubs.

There are many Rugby League supporters' trusts currently in the UK who run and operate their respective clubs, such as [[Rochdale Hornets]] for example, likewise, so do some rugby union clubs, for example [[Friends of Newport Rugby]], representing [[Newport RFC]].
