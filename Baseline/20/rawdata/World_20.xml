U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] has received widespread criticism due to his support of government surveillance. President Obama had released many statements on [[mass surveillance]] as a result.

==The Patriot Act==
As a [[United States Senate|senator]], Obama condemned the [[Patriot Act]] for violating the rights of American citizens. He argued that it allowed government agents to perform extensive and in-depth searches on American citizens without a search warrant. He also argued that it was possible to secure the United States against terrorist attacks while preserving individual liberty.&lt;ref name="Obama Speeches"&gt;{{cite speech | url=http://obamaspeeches.com/041-The-PATRIOT-Act-Obama-Speech.htm| title=Senate Floor Statement - The PATRIOT Act| date=December 15, 2005| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act, specifically provisions allowing roaming wiretaps and government searches of business records. Obama argued that the renewal was needed to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. However, the renewal was criticized by several members of Congress who argued that the provisions did not do enough to curtail excessive searches.&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43180202/ns/us_news-security/t/obama-europe-signs-patriot-act-extension/#.Uw1-ojoo7IU |title=Obama, in Europe, signs Patriot Act extension | date=2011-05-27|accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also received criticism for his reversal on privacy protection.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/02/sen-obama-warned-about-patriot-act-abuses-president-obama-proved-him-right/|title=Sen. Obama warned about Patriot Act abuses. President Obama proved him right.| date=August 2, 2013| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reaction to NSA mass surveillance leaks==
In June 2013, reports from a cache of [[top secret]] documents [[Leak (news)|leaked]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its international partners had created a global system of surveillance that was responsible for the mass collection of information on American and foreign citizens.

Obama initially defended NSA mass surveillance programs when they were first leaked. He argued that NSA surveillance was transparent and claimed that the NSA is unable and had made no attempt to monitor the phone calls and e-mails of American citizens.&lt;ref name="HuffPo-Reilly-06172013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/obama-nsa-surveillance_n_3455771.html | title=Obama Defends NSA Surveillance Program, Says It's 'Transparent' | work=Huffington Post | date=June 17, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Reilly, Molly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Snowden's admittance to leaking classified documents regarding national surveillance, Obama attempted to ignore the issue of NSA surveillance. It was speculated that Obama did this to avoid complicating the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigation into Snowden.&lt;ref name="Politico-Epstein-06112013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/edward-snowden-obama-92580.html | title=As Edward Snowden Speaks out, President Obama goes quiet | work=Politico | date=June 11, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Epstein, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Obama argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the NSA surveillance programs when they were leaked by Snowden. Obama stated that it would have been best for the American people to have never learned about the programs. He also criticized Snowden for not using existing systems within the federal government for whistleblowers. The latter statement was criticized as Snowden would have been directed to one of the committees responsible for protecting the secrecy of NSA surveillance if he had used the existing whistle-blower system.&lt;ref name="CNN-Wolf-08132013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower | title=Fact-checking Obama's claims about Snowden | work=CNN Politics | date=August 13, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Wolf, Z. Byron}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also promised to make public information about government surveillance and work with Congress to increase public confidence in the government.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse-08092013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/09/background-president-s-statement-reforms-nsa-programs | title=Background on the President’s Statement on Reforms to NSA Programs | work=The White House Office of the Press Secretary | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 17, 2014 speech==
On January 17, 2014,  President Obama gave a public address on mass surveillance.

}} During the speech, Obama promised increased restrictions on data collection of American citizens, which would include the requirement of court approval for searches of telephone records. In addition, Obama called for increased oversight and admitted the dangers NSA surveillance posed to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/opinion/the-president-on-mass-surveillance.html?_r=1 | title=The President on Mass Surveillance | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=The Editorial Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
Obama's speech was criticized for being deliberately vague and not going far enough to protect civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"/&gt;

Representatives for [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo]] stated that Obama's proposed reforms represented positive progress, but that they did not ultimately do enough to protect privacy rights. A representative for [[Mozilla]] noted that mass surveillance had damaged the open Internet and caused balkanization and distrust.&lt;ref name="LATimes-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/17/business/la-fi-tn-silicon-valleys-reaction-obama-nsa-reforms-20140117 | title=Silicon Valley's reaction to Obama's NSA reforms: Not Enough | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Guynn, Jessica | location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen. [[Rand Paul]] criticized the remarks, saying: {{quote|1=While I am encouraged the President is addressing the NSA spying program because of pressure from Congress and the American people, I am disappointed in the details. The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] requires an individualized warrant based on probable cause before the government can search phone records and e-mails. President Obama’s announced solution to the NSA spying controversy is the same unconstitutional program with a new configuration.  I intend to continue the fight to restore Americans' rights through my [[Fourth Amendment Restoration Act]] and my legal challenge against the NSA. The American people should not expect the fox to guard the hen house.&lt;ref name="GlobalDispatch-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/rand-paul-on-obama-nsa-reform-the-american-people-should-not-expect-the-fox-to-guard-the-hen-house-54111/ | title=Rand Paul On Obama NSA Reform: ‘The American People Should Not Expect The Fox To Guard The Hen House’ | work=The Global Dispatch | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Herriman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dianne Feinstein]], a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that all but two or three of the members of her committee support Obama. Likewise, she criticized "privacy people" for not understanding the threat terrorists pose to the United States.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/19/22358363-congressional-intelligence-chairmen-applaud-obama-for-backing-surveillance | title=Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Curry, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Obama's stance on NSA surveillance. [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], another member of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the proposed reform of NSA surveillance, but admitted that they were necessary to calm down the "[[ACLU]] types".&lt;ref name="HuffPo-01252014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/nsa-obama-reaction_n_4619683.html | title=The NSA's Biggest Fans Are Happy With Obama's Speech | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=January 25, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=McAuliff | first1=Michael | last2=Sledge | first2=Matt | last3=Siddiqui | first3=Sabrina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions from global leaders were limited. Great Britain and Russia, both states with extensive surveillance programs, offered no comments. [[Dilma Rousseff]], the current president of Brazil and an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance, also refused to comment. In Germany, a government spokesperson demanded greater protection for non-Americans in reaction to the speech. [[Der Spiegel]] accused the NSA of turning the internet into a weapons system.&lt;ref name="WaPo-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tepid-global-reaction-to-obamas-nsa-vow/2014/01/17/a37a43ac-7fb5-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html | title=Tepid global reaction to Obama's NSA Vow | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Witte, Griff | location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] stated that Obama's pledge to reform the phone data collection is a step in the right direction, but demanded that actual laws be passed regarding this reform.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140119/obama-merkel-doesnt-need-to-worry-about-spying | title=Obama to Merkel: Don't worry about spying | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full point was awarded in each category where Obama fully made the promised reform. However, partial points were awarded for reforms that had not been fully completed, but where the EFF and The Day We Fight Back felt that progress as being made.&lt;ref name="TheDayWeFightBack-ObamaScorecard"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thedaywefightback.org/obama-scorecard/ | title=A Scorecard for Obama's Surveillance Reform Announcement | work=[[The Day We Fight Back]] | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=Cohn | first1=Cindy | last2=Reitman | first2=Rainey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama received praise for adding independent advocates to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) courts and opposing the [[FISA Improvements Act]]. However, it was also noted that Obama had not made any progress on giving metadata storage responsibility to a third party, ending the undermining of encryption standards, increasing transparency within the NSA and protecting whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="EFFCohn"/&gt;

==Statements to the German people==
On January 18, Obama spoke to [[ZDF]] in an attempt to improve the United States relations with Germany,&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/18/22353575-obama-promises-germans-that-us-wont-wiretap-them-merkel | title=Obama Promises Germans That US Won't Wiretap Them, Merkel | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304603704579329084011340404 | title=Obama Promises Not to Spy on Merkel | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Thomas, Andrea | location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which a German foreign office official said were "worse than … the low-point in 2003 during the Iraq War" due to the surveillance leaks.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22338261-us-germany-relations-hit-new-low-amid-nsa-spying-scandal-official-says | title=U.S.-Germany relations hit new low amid NSA spying scandal, official says | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 17, 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Lamarque, Kevin | location=[[Mainz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama promised that he would not let revelations about mass surveillance damage [[Germany–United States relations|German-American relations]]  and admitted that it would take a long time for the United States to regain the trust of the German people. However, he maintained that the surveillance was necessary for international security.

German reactions to the speeches given by Obama on January 17 and 18 ranged from skeptical to outright hostile. Members of the German media argued that they were hopeful that Obama would bring about needed reform. However, they also noted that his statements were vague and argued that they did not represent legitimate reform. Many German political leaders responded with outright hostility. [[Thomas Oppermann]], the chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]], demanded a no-spy treaty and stated that American surveillance constituted a crime. The German attorney general argued that there were grounds for a criminal investigation into the NSA's tapping of [[Angela Merkel]]'s cell phone.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01202014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140120/the-usa-knows-that-for-us-spying-is-a-crime-germany-nsa-obama-snowden | title='The USA knows that for us spying is a crime' | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 20, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed overhaul of NSA phone surveillance programs==
On March 25, 2014, Obama promised to end the NSA's collection and storage of bulk phone-call data. Despite this promise, his administration continued to seek reauthorization of the telephone metadata program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-press-releases-2014/1147-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-u-s-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-12-14 |title=Joint Statement from the ODNI and the U.S. DOJ on the Declassification of Renewal of Collection Under Section 501 of the FISA |access-date=March 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175215/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-press-releases-2014/1147-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-u-s-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-12-14 |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approved every 90 days by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]], with the most recent authority set to expire June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1180-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-3-11 |title=Joint Statement from the ODNI and the DOJ on the Declassification of Renewal of Collection Under Section 501 of the FISA |access-date=March 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326182117/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1180-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-3-11 |archive-date=March 26, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a plan submitted by the Obama Administration to Congress, the NSA would be required to  conduct searches of data at phone companies. They would also need to receive a warrant from a federal judge to conduct the search.

The overhaul proposal received support from the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/us/aclu-files-suit-over-phone-surveillance-program.html|title=A.C.L.U. Files Lawsuit Seeking to Stop the Collection of Domestic Phone Logs|date=June 12, 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the organization claimed that it was a crucial first step in reining in NSA surveillance.&lt;ref name="Washington Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/25/obama-defends-nsa-shift-data-gathering/?page=1| title=Obama seeks NSA surveillance overhaul| date=March 25, 2014 | agency=Washington Times | accessdate=April 9, 2014 | author=Boyer, Dave | location=[[Mainz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overhaul was criticized by several officials, however, because it would force telephone carriers to store customers metadata that they previously not legally obligated to keep. Reactions from the carriers were generally positive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A representative of [[Sprint Corporation]] stated that the carrier was examining the president's proposal with great interest.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/03/usa-security-obama-idUSL1N0MS1QW20140403?type=companyNews&amp;feedType=RSS| title=Obama's NSA overhaul may require phone carriers to store more data| date=April 3, 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=April 9, 2014 | author=Hosenball, Mark | location=[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2015, the administration's proposals have not been implemented and the NSA retains the authority to collect and store telephone record metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/one-year-later-obama-failing-promise-rein-nsa |title=One Year Later, Obama Failing on Promise to Rein in NSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuses and 4th Amendment Violations by the NSA and FBI==

On May 24, 2017, a declassified FISA report&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama intel agency secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked [[Classified information#Top Secret .28TS.29|"Top Secret"]] was published, noting that the NSA routinely violated the 4th Amendment of Americans and abused intelligence tools to do so. The Obama administration self-disclosed the problems at a closed-door hearing on Oct. 26 before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, two weeks before the 2016 election. The report labeled the matter a “very serious Fourth Amendment issue," citing an "institutional lack of candor" on the part of the administration. It also criticized the NSA as having “disregard” for rules and “deficient” oversight.

More than 5 percent, or one out of every 20 searches seeking upstream Internet data on Americans inside the NSA’s so-called Section 702 database, violated the safeguards the Obama administration vowed to follow in 2011. In addition, there was a three-fold increase in NSA data searches about Americans and a rise in the unmasking of U.S. person’s identities in intelligence reports after the administration loosened privacy rules in 2011. Many of the searches involved any and all mentions of foreign targets.

Officials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice have argued their activities were legal under the so-called minimization rule changes the Obama administration made, and that the intelligence agencies were strictly monitored to avoid abuses. The FISA court and the NSA's own internal watchdog entity disputes this claim, stating that the administration conducting such queries were "in violation of that prohibition, with much greater frequency than had been previously disclosed to the Court.”

===Sharing of data by the FBI===

The FISA report also indicated hundreds of incidences in which the FBI illegally shared raw surveillance data illegally obtained by the NSA with private entities. Earlier in May, then-FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers his agency used sensitive espionage data gathered about Americans without a warrant only when it was “lawfully collected, carefully overseen and checked.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declassified memos show FBI illegally shared spy data on Americans with private parties|url=http://circa.com/politics/declassified-memos-show-fbi-illegally-shared-spy-data-on-americans-with-private-parties|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the report declared that “The Court is nonetheless concerned about the FBI’s apparent disregard of minimization rules and whether the FBI is engaging in similar disclosures of raw Section 702 information that have not been reported.”

In a declassified report from 2015,&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/o1501.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the internal watchdog had concerns as early as 2012 that the FBI was submitting "deficient” reports indicating it had a clean record complying with spy data gathered on Americans without a warrant. While Section 702 of the Foreign Surveillance Act, last updated by Congress in 2008, allowed the NSA to share with the FBI spy data collected without a warrant, the FISA report indicates FBI compliance problems began months after the updated legislation was implemented. The FBI’s very first compliance report in 2009 declared it had not found any instances in which agents accessed NSA intercepts supposedly gathered overseas about an American who in fact was on U.S. soil. The Inspector General, however, said it reviewed the same data and easily found evidence that the FBI accessed NSA data gathered on a person who likely was in the United States, making it illegal to review without a warrant.

===Reaction===

On April 28, the NSA issued a rare press release indicating it will no longer monitor all internet communications that mention a foreign intelligence target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/statements/2017-04-28-702-statement.shtml|title=NSA Statement: NSA Stops Certain Section 702 "Upstream" Activities|website=www.nsa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neema Singh Guliani, the ACLU's legislative counsel in Washington, DC stated, “I think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Farrell, Director of Investigations for the watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted, "This is an abuse of power and authority like we have never seen in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Chris|title=Obama’s NSA conducted illegal searches on Americans for years: Report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qk1GH68NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of CMMB (known as a committee of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Hospital Association]] until 1927) dates back to 1912, when a personal tragedy inspired CMMB’s founder Dr. Paluel J. Flagg to commit to medical [[missionary]] work, beginning with [[leprosy]] patients in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt;

For many decades, CMMB prioritized the shipping of medical supplies and equipment to missionaries and health partners around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Garesche, [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=lnq The Catholic Medical Mission Board and its Work], ''The Linacre Quarterly'', Volume 2, Number 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28560">'''Cuban medical internationalism''' is the [[Cuba]]n programme, since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], of sending Cuban medical personnel overseas, particularly to [[Latin America]], [[Africa]] and, more recently, [[Cuban-Pacific relations#Cuban medical aid|Oceania]],&lt;ref name="plenglish.com"&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com:80/article.asp?ID=%7B771AA7E5-B9F3-4129-AFF7-208C0DC1D65D%7D)&amp;language=EN "Cuban Physicians to Aid 81 Nations"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Prensa Latina]], March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and of bringing medical students and patients to Cuba. In 2007, "Cuba has 42,000 workers in international collaborations in 103 different countries, of whom more than 30,000 are health personnel, including no fewer than 19,000 physicians."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Cuba provides more medical personnel to the developing world than all the [[G8]] countries combined,&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; although this comparison does not take into account G8 [[development aid]] spent on developing world healthcare. The Cuban missions have had substantial positive local impact on the populations served.&lt;ref&gt;San Sebastián, Miguel, Anna-Kari Hurtig, Jaime Breilh, et al. 2005 “The People’s Health Movement: health for all now.” Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health 18: 45–49.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that medical workers are Cuba's most important export commodity.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions abroad==

In 2007, one academic study on Cuban internationalism surveyed the history of the programme, noting its broad sweep: "Since the early 1960s, 28,422 Cuban health workers have worked in 37 Latin American countries, 31,181 in 33 African countries, and 7,986 in 24 Asian countries. Throughout a period of four decades, Cuba sent 67,000 health workers to structural cooperation programs, usually for at least two years, in 94 countries ... an average of 3,350 health workers working abroad every year between 1960 and 2000."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

===Anti-colonialism===

The programme was initiated in 1963 as part of Cuba's foreign policy of supporting [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] struggles. It began when Cuba sent a small medical brigade to [[Algeria]], which suffered from the mass withdrawal of French medical personnel during the independence war; some wounded soldiers and war orphans were also transported back to Cuba for treatment.&lt;ref name="brouwer09"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php | title=The Cuban Revolutionary Doctor: The Ultimate Weapon of Solidarity | first=Steve | last=Brouwer | date=January 2009 | work=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gleijeses |first= Piero |authorlink= Piero Gleijeses |year= 1996 |title= Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961-1965 |journal= [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 159–195 |jstor= 157991 |quote= The Minister of Public Health, Jose Ramón Machado Ventura, led the group, which included 29 doctors, three dentists, 15 nurses and eight medical technicians. (There were 45 men and ten women.) .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. With the arrival of this medical mission in Algeria on 24 May 1963, Cuba's technical assistance abroad began. |doi=10.1017/s0022216x00012670}} (Quote is from p.&amp;nbsp;165).&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba did this at a time when, following the Cuban revolution, "half of the country’s 6,000 doctors fled".&lt;ref name="HuishKirk07" /&gt; Between 1966 and 1974, Cuban doctors worked alongside Cuban [[artillery]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]] during its independence war against Portugal.&lt;ref name="HuishKirk07" /&gt; Cuba's largest foreign campaign was in [[Angola]]: within two years of the campaign, by 1977, "only one Angolan province out of sixteen was without Cuban health technicians."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Sylvester, 1994. “Cuba and the liberation of Southern Africa.” ''Monthly Review'' 46 (September): 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1979, Cuba developed a strong relationship with [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, T., Sims, H.D. (1985), "Cuba and Nicaragua: a key regional relationship, 1979-1984." ''Cuban Studies'' 15 (2), pp. 73-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarianism===
However, alongside internationalism driven by foreign policy objectives, humanitarian objectives also played a role, with medical teams despatched to countries governed by ideological foes. For example, in 1960, 1972 and 1990 it dispatched emergency assistance teams to Chile and Nicaragua, and Iran following earthquakes.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Similarly, Venezuela's [[Mission Barrio Adentro]] programme grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=briggsAJPH09&gt;Briggs, Charles, and Mantini-Briggs, Clara (2009), ''American Journal of Public Health'', "Confronting Health Disparities: Latin American Social Medicine in Venezuela", I(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban medical missions were sent to [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Haiti]] following 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]] and [[Hurricane Georges]], and remained there semi-permanently.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; This has been part of a dramatic expansion of Cuba’s international cooperation in health since 1998.&lt;ref name=devos08&gt;De Vos et al (2008), "Cuba's health system: Challenges ahead", ''Health Policy and Planning'', 23(4), pg:288-290&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt;

In Honduras the medical personnel had a substantial impact: "In the areas they served, infant mortality rates were reduced from 30.8 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rates from 48.1 to 22.4 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2003."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; However, as one academic paper notes, "The idea of a nation saving lives and improving the human condition is alien to traditional statecraft and is therefore discounted as a rationale for the Cuban approach."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2004 the 1700 medical personnel in [[Guatemala]] received the [[Order of the Quetzal]], the country's highest state honour.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; A 2005 attempt by Honduras to expel the Cuban mission on the basis that it was threatening Honduran jobs was successfully resisted by trade unions and community organisations.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Asian tsunami]], Cuba sent medical assistance to [[Banda Aceh]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=devos07&gt;De Vos et al (2007), "Cuba's International Cooperation in Health: an Overview", ''International Journal of Health Services'', Volume 37, Number 4, Pages 761–776&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cuba prepared to send 1500 doctors to the [[New Orleans]]; the offer was refused. Several months later the mission was dispatched to [[Pakistan]] following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] there. Ultimately Cuba sent "more than 2,500 disaster response experts, surgeons, family doctors, and other health personnel", who stayed through the winter for more than 6 months.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, A.S. (2006). "Cuban doctors in Pakistan: Why Cuba still inspires". ''Monthly Review'' 58 (6), pp. 49-55&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba is helping with the medical crisis in Haiti due to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/saude/2010/0/3/Cuba-grants-medical-aid-Haitian-earthquake-victims,a1293e93-e022-4af7-ac52-a49bdf9e635b.html|title=Cuba grants medical aid to Haitian earthquake victims|date=18 January 2010|publisher=Agencia Angola Press|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 152 Cuban medical and educational personnel in the Haitian capital [[Port-au-Prince]] at the time of the earthquake were reported to be safe, with two suffering minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=18130|title=Cuba Reacts to Haiti Earthquake |last=Robinson|first=Circles |date=January 14, 2010|publisher=Havana Times|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Cuba sent 103 nurses and 62 doctors to help fight the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]], the biggest contribution of health care staff by any single country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last = Kupferschmidt |first = Kai |date = 12 September 2014 |title = Cuba to commit large health corps to Ebola fight |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/09/cuba-commit-large-health-corps-ebola-fight |website = [[Science (journal)|news.sciencemag.org]] |accessdate = 15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{main|Mission Barrio Adentro}}
Cuba's largest and most extensive medical aid effort is with [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mission Barrio Adentro|program]] grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people. Under this bilateral effort, also known as the "oil for doctors" program, Cuba provides Venezuela with 31,000 Cuban doctors and dentists and provides training for 40,000 Venezuelan medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Andrea|date=26 December 2016|title=Cuban President Raul Castro faces deep problems in 2017|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a66f93b0a0df447dbbc5c7bb143d5b42/cuban-president-raul-castro-faces-deep-problems-2017|website=bigstory.ap.org|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=26 December 2016|quote=Venezuela was the prime destination alongside Brazil for Cuban doctors and other professionals whose salaries go directly to the Cuban government, providing another vital source of hard currency believed to be slackening in recent years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Venezuela provides Cuba with 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Based on February 2010 prices, the oil is worth $7.5 million per day, or nearly $3 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Cuba has also sent notable missions to Bolivia (particularly since the 2005 election of [[Evo Morales]]) and [[South Africa]], the latter in particular after a post-[[apartheid]] [[brain drain]] of white doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08&gt;Julie M. Feinsilver (2008), [http://www.nuso.org/upload/articulos/3537_2.pdf "Oil-for-Doctors: Cuban Medical Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From a Venezuelan Friend"], ''Nueva Sociedad'' 216 July–August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, a co-operation agreement with South Africa has seen hundreds of Cuban doctors practice in South Africa, while South Africa sends medical students to Cuba to study.&lt;ref name="bday"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "Cuba, SA health deal is in good shape"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the two governments signed another deal, increasing numbers on both sides. South African can now send 1 000 students to Cuba for training which, South Africa believes, will help train the doctors it so desperately needs for the implementation of its National Health Insurance Scheme.&lt;ref name="bday12"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "SA signs deal with Cuba for more doctors"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1999 violence in [[East Timor]], the country of a million people was left with only 35 physicians and 75% of its population displaced. The number later increased to 79 physicians by 2004, and Cuba sent an additional 182 physicians and technicians.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08&gt;Robert Huish and Jerry Spiegel (2008), "INTEGRATING HEALTH AND HUMAN SECURITY INTO FOREIGN POLICY: CUBA’S SURPRISING SUCCESS", ''The International Journal of Cuban Studies'' Volume 1 Issue 1, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"From 1963 to 2004, Cuba was involved in the creation of nine medical faculties in Yemen, Guyana, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, Ghana, Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, and Haiti."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

====Oceania====
In the 2000s, Cuba began establishing or strengthening relations with [[Pacific Island]] countries, and providing medical aid to those countries. Cuba's medical aid to Pacific countries has been two-pronged, consisting in sending doctors to Oceania, and in providing scholarships for Pacific students to study medicine in Cuba at Cuba's expense.

There are currently sixteen doctors providing specialised medical care in [[Kiribati]], with sixteen more scheduled to join them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/01/six-more-cuban-physicians-to-serve-in-kiribati Pacific Magazine: Six More Cuban Physicians To Serve In Kiribati&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubans have also offered training to I-Kiribati doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=26617 Kiribati discusses medical training with Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors have reportedly provided a dramatic improvement to the field of medical care in Kiribati, reducing the child mortality rate in that country by 80%,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=33793 Cuban doctors reduce Kiribati infant mortality rate by 80 percent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and winning the proverbial hearts and minds in the Pacific. In response, the [[Solomon Islands]] began recruiting Cuban doctors in July 2007, while [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji]] considered following suit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 2008, Cuba was due to send doctors to the Solomon Islands, [[Vanuatu]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]] and Papua New Guinea,&lt;ref name="plenglish.com"/&gt; while seventeen medical students from Vanuatu would study in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=41373 "Vanuatu to get six doctors from Cuba"], Radio New Zealand International, August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that it might also provide training for Fiji doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=38964 "Fiji says Cuban help sought as neighbours turn away"], Radio New Zealand International, April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2008, fifteen Cuban doctors were serving in Kiribati, sixty-four Pacific students were studying medicine in Cuba, and Cuban authorities were offering "up to 400 scholarships to young people of that region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm "Cuban Foreign Minister Opens Cuba-Pacific Islands Meeting"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090614213049/http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Cuban News Agency, September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among those sixty-four students were twenty-five Solomon Islanders, twenty I-Kiribati, two Nauruans and seventeen ni-Vanuatu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0929especialnusa.htm "Small Island States and Global Challenges"], Cuban News Agency, September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific Islanders have been studying in Cuba since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2366887.htm?tab=latest "Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana"], ABC Radio Australia, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, [[Prensa Latina]] reported that Cuban doctors had "inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu". One Cuban doctor had been serving in Tuvalu since October 2008, and two more since February 2009. They had reportedly "attended 3,496 patients, and saved 53 lives", having "opened ultrasound and abortion services, as well as specialized consultations on hypertension, diabetes, and chronic diseases in children". They had visited all the country's islands, and were training local staff in "primary health care, and how to deal with seriously ill patients, among other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2009/06/14/17664/cuban_doctors_have_inaugurated_a_series_new_health_services_tuvalu_a_small_island_nation_pacific.html "Cuban doctors have inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu a small island nation in the Pacific"], Prensa Latina, June 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===
Missions abroad are intended to provide services at low cost to the host country. "Patients are not charged for services, and the recipient countries are expected to cover only the cost of collective housing, air fare, and limited food and supplies not exceeding $200 a month. While
Cuban doctors are abroad, they continue to receive their salaries as well as a stipend in foreign currency."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2008, the pay for Cuban doctors abroad was 183$ per month, whereas the pay for doctors working domestically was 23$ per month.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; 
A new term - "disaster tourism" - has arisen in response to a growing number of large-scale natural disasters.  This phrase refers to individuals, governments and organizations who travel to a disaster area with the primary goal of having an "experience" rather than providing meaningful aid.  Such aid is often short-lived, and may even get in the way of more serious rescue efforts.  Cuban medical internationalism represents a polar opposite to this disaster tourism mentality, with a focus on large-scale, sustained aid targeting the most marginalized and under-served populations across the globe. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=John|title=Healthcare Without Borders: Understanding Cuban Medical Internationalism|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=9780813061054|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationalism at home==
Since 1990, Cuba has provided long-term care for 18,000 victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], "offering treatment for hair loss, skin disorders, cancer, leukemia, and other illnesses attributed to radioactivity."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

In response to the 1998 [[Hurricane Mitch]], Cuba set up the "Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina" ("[[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]]"; ELAM) outside Havana, converted from a former naval base. It accepts around 1500 students per year.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07&gt;Robert Huish and John M. Kirk (2007), "Cuban Medical Internationalism and the Development of the Latin American School of Medicine", ''Latin American Perspectives'', 34; 77&lt;/ref&gt; ELAM forms part of a range of medical education and training initiatives; "Cubans, with the help of Venezuela, are currently educating more doctors, about 70,000 in all, than all the medical schools in the United States, which typically have somewhere between 64,000 to 68,000 students enrolled in their programs."&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the development of cooperation with Venezuela through Mission Barrio Adentro, Mission Milagro / Operación Milagro was set up to provide [[ophthalmology]] services to Cuban, Venezuelan and Latin American patients, both in Cuba and in other countries. "As of August 2007, Cuba had performed over 750,000 eye surgeries, at no cost, including 113,000 surgeries for its own citizens."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

==Effects on Cuba==

===Benefits===
Although humanitarian principles figure, ideological factors were prominent in Cuba's "doctor diplomacy", particularly during the [[Cold War]]. Subsequently, its continuation has been seen as a vital means to promote Cuba's image abroad and prevent international isolation. For Cuba's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Honduras in 2002, Cuba's health missions in that country were "undoubtedly a deciding factor";&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Guatemala reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1998.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

At the 2009 [[5th Summit of the Americas]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] commented that at the summit he had heard much about the impact of Cuban "soft diplomacy" in the form of its medical internationalism. He said this might be a reminder to the [[United States]] that limiting its interactions with Latin American countries to military and drug interdiction might be limiting its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/4376 "Chavez-Obama Meeting at Summit Relaunches U.S.-Venezuela Relations"] (20 April 2009). venezuelanalysis.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that Cuban medical internationalism promotes exports of Cuban medical technology, and may be a source of hard currency (although the targeting of poor countries reduces the hard currency potential of missions abroad).&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2006 Cuba's earnings from medical services (including export of doctors) amounted to US$2,312m – 28% of total export receipts and net capital payments. This exceeded earnings from both nickel and cobalt exports and from tourism.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; These earnings are achieved despite the fact that a substantial part of Cuba's medical internationalism since 1998 has been organised within the framework of the "Integrated Health Program" (Programa Integral de Salud, PIS); this cooperation program is free for the receiving country.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Cuba's co-operation with Venezuela provides Cuba with cheap oil in exchange for its medical support to Mission Barrio Adentro.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Bloomberg reported in March 2014 that Cuban state-controlled media forecasted revenue of $8.2 million that year from the program.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Sabo, Bloomberg.com, Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the programme has, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, "perform[ed] a critical function in consolidating socialist consciousness" within Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Saney, I. 2009, "Homeland of humanity: Internationalism within the Cuban revolution", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 36 (1), pp. 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Although Cuba's large-scale medical training programmes and high doctor-patient ratios give it much latitude, the expansion of doctor diplomacy since 2004, particularly with the Barrio Adentro programme, has been dramatic: the number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt; This has had some impact on the domestic health system, for example with increased waiting times, particularly with regard to family doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; The number of patients per doctor rose from 139 to 179.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08/&gt; In March 2008 Cuba announced a reorganisation of its domestic family doctor programme for greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt;

====Defection====
In 2000, two Cuban doctors working in Zimbabwe attempted to defect to Canada. They were prevented from doing so by two Zimbabwean soldiers, who handed them over to Cuban officials.&lt;ref name="vanish"&gt;''Miami Herald'', 6 June 2000, [http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/CNews/y00/jun00/06e4.htm Cuban doctors vanish in Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations officials said Zimbabwe appeared to have violated national and international laws.

In August 2006 the [[United States]] under [[George W. Bush]] created the Cuban Medical Professional Parole program,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Dept, [https://www.state.gov/p/wha/rls/fs/2009/115414.htm "Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program"], accessed 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; specifically targeting Cuban medical personnel and encouraging them to defect when they are working in a country outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; Of an estimated 40,000 eligible medical personnel, over 1000 had entered the United States under the program by October 2007, according to the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.coha.org/2007/10/hundreds-of-cuban-medical-workers-defecting-to-us-while-overseas/ | title=Hundreds of Cuban medical workers defecting to U.S. while overseas | first=Tal | last=Abbady | work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel | date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promised fast-track visa is not always forthcoming, with at least one applicant waiting a year for his visa; although according to Dr. Julio Cesar Alfonso of the Cuban dissident organization "Outside the Barrio," the U.S. government has rejected only a handful of the hundreds of applications for visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=981 | title=Cuban Doctors Abroad Helped to Defect by New U.S. Visa Policy | first=Mike | last=Ceasar | work=World Politics Review | date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2017, President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] announced the end of the program, saying that both Cuba and the US work to "combat diseases that endanger the health and lives of our people. By providing preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel, the medical parole program contradicts those efforts, and risks harming the Cuban people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitefield|first1=Mimi|title=Obama ending ‘wet foot, dry foot’ Cuban immigration policy|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article126202999.html|work=Miami Herald|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal, "growing numbers of Cuban doctors sent overseas to work are defecting to the USA", some via Colombia, where they have sought temporary asylum.&lt;ref name="defect"/&gt; In February 2007, at least 38 doctors were requesting asylum in the U.S. embassy in Bogotá after asylum was denied by the Colombian government.&lt;ref&gt;''El Universal'' 3 Feb 2007 {{es icon}} [http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2007/02/03/pol_art_166219.shtml "Cubanos desertores atrapados en Bogotá"].&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors working abroad are reported to be monitored by "minders" and subject to curfew.&lt;ref name="defect"&gt;Ceaser, Michael (2007). "Cuban doctors working abroad defect to the USA". ''The Lancet'', Volume 369, Issue 9569&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luis Zuñiga, director of human rights for the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], Cuban doctors are "slave workers" who labor for meager wages while bolstering Cuba's image as a donor nation and "the Cuban government exports these doctors as merchandise".&lt;ref name="vanish"/&gt;

==Possible effects of lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba==
An article by Laurie Garrett in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' warns that lifting of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States trade and travel restrictions on Cuba]] could have dire consequences for Cuba's healthcare system, leading to an exodus of thousands of well-trained Cuban healthcare professionals. U.S. companies could also transform the remaining healthcare system into a destination for [[medical tourism]]. Garrett concludes that if politicians do not take great care, lifting of the restrictions would rob Cuba of its greatest triumph.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs), both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease (YLDs). One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kay00"&gt;{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |booktitle=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; The report found that approximately one fourth of the global disease burden and more than one third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".&lt;ref name="whatisenv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
*Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
*[[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
*[[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
*[[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
*[[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
*[[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
*Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands&lt;ref name="whatisenv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
*Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
*Lead
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name="oberg10"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|year=2010|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural climate change (as opposed to man-made climate change)
*Occupational [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate]]s or [[carcinogen]]s
*Outdoor air pollution
*[[Sanitation]] and hygiene problems
*[[Second-hand smoke]]
*Solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification" /&gt;

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.&lt;ref name="knol05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt; Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt; For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fewtrell07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to the Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.&lt;ref name="wigmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="wigmore" /&gt;

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need).  The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values.  Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIBA Women's World Ranking''' is the [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national women's [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

==Calculation==
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events' weights===
FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|-

|-

|-

| 4 || [[FIBA Asia Women's Cup]] || 0.3
|-
| 4 || [[EuroBasket Women]] || 1
|-
| 4 || [[FIBA Oceania Women's Championship]] || 0.1

===Competition ranking points===
[[File:FIFA World Rankings for Women.png|thumb|300px|Map of FIBA World Ranking for women]]
As opposed to [[Association football|football]] tournaments, teams still have to go through a series of consolation and classification rounds even if they've been eliminated from title contention, so that a complete ranking of the teams will be possible.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

The calculations are done after the tournaments stated above in a group of two Olympic cycles (8 years). The oldest tournament outside the 8-year period is discarded and replaced with the newest competition.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

This means that in every computation, there are:
* Four continental championships
* Two [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]]s
* Two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournaments]]

===Example===
The {{wnbt|United States}}' 1000.0 points were calculated by this method:

After the conclusion of the 2017 continental championships, the points gained from the 2009 continental championships were replaced with those gained from the 2017 editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35564">The '''FIVB World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[volleyball]]. The teams of the member nations of [[FIVB]], volleyball's world governing body, are ranked based on their competitions results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the importance of each FIVB International competitions and Continental competitions also. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant competitions being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. {{as of|2017|August}} the top 3 teams in men's category are, world's no.1 [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], no.2 [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and in women's category are as follows, world's no.1 [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], no.2 [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]].

The ranking system was most recently revamped after the 2006 [[FIVB World League|World League]] (for men) and 2006 [[FIVB World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] (for women).

The rankings are used in international competitions to define the seeded teams and arrange them in pools. Specific procedures for seeding and pooling are established by the FIVB in each competition's formula, but the method usually employed is the [[serpentine system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15993">The '''Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network''' ('''GOARN''') is a network composed of numerous technical and public health institutions, laboratories, NGOs, and other organizations that work to observe and respond to threatening epidemics.&lt;ref name="IHRGOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/about/IHR_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_respond.pdf |title=International Health Regulations Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |date=1 May 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN works closely with and under the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which is one of its most notable partners. Its goals are to: examine and study diseases, evaluate the risks that certain diseases pose, and improve international capability to deal with diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network-GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/goarnenglish.pdf |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

The [[World Health Organization]] realized at the start of the 21st century that it did not have the resources required to adequately respond to and prevent epidemics around the world. Thus, a "Framework for Global Outbreak and Response" was created by the Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response, and Regional Offices. This framework was put then forth in a meeting in Geneva from April 26–28, 2000. In this meeting, which was attended by 121 representatives from 67 institutions, the decision was made to form GOARN to contribute resources, coordination, surveillance, and technical assistance towards combating diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=4 September 2014 |journal=Global Public Health |author=John S. Mackenzie |pmc=4205922 |pmid=25186571 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.951870 |volume=9 |pages=1023–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that GOARN would be directed by a steering committee made of 20 representatives of GOARN partners and an operational support team (OST) based in WHO. The steering committee oversees and plans the activities of GOARN, and the OST is composed of a minimum of 5–6 WHO staff. Task forces and groups were established to deal with specific issues.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/surveillance/whocdscsr2003.pdf |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response. Report of a WHO meeting |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN resources are primarily coordinated by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network" /&gt;

==Goals==

The WHO's guiding principles are to standardize "epidemiological, laboratory, clinical management, research, communication, logistics, support, security, evacuation, and communication systems" and coordinative international resources to support local efforts by GOARN partners to combat outbreaks. It also focuses on improving long term ability to provide technical assistance to affected areas.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting" /&gt;

==Partners==

GOARN has grown to now have over 600 partners in the form of public health institutions, networks, laboratories, and [[United Nations]] and non-governmental organizations. Technical institutions, networks, and organizations that have the ability to improve GOARN's capabilities are eligible for partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/ |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its partners, GOARN is staffed by a variety of individuals who specialize in public health, such as "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilization experts, emergency management and public health professionals among others."&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its biggest partner, WHO plays a large role in GOARN. Alongside coordinating its resources to combat outbreaks, WHO provides much of the staffing and assistance for GOARN, though as will be covered later, does not fund GOARN directly. Since the network is primarily led by the WHO, there is some uncertainty as to whether WHO should be considered a partner in GOARN or if the network should be considered a WHO initiative.

Another notable partner is the [[Center for Disease Control]], which sends technical resources and staff to GOARN. The CDC also has a history of resource sharing and cooperation with WHO in order to combat disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_t-iBC3LiEC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=GOARN+CDC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=isv4GUkBWC&amp;sig=w-0SZ3lZH7ZEMrEU9mLTXWDLUjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr6eGd6uTOAhUOzGMKHf-xAicQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author1=Kenneth H. Mayer  |author2=H.F. Pizer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The WHO does not directly fund GOARN. Instead, GOARN members and outside fundraising that is carried out each time there is a new incidence is used to support the GOARN response. The [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] provides GOARN with US$500,000 as a revolving fund, meant to be used for quickly mobilizing response teams. This is known as the WHO-NTI Global Emergency Response Fund, and must be repaid after withdrawal. The GOARN is effective at operating from a fairly small budget.&lt;ref name="Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/2.full |title=Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance |date=28 September 2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author=Philippe Calain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field missions==

GOARN has responded to over 120 occurrences in 85 countries and has deployed over 2,300 experts into the field.&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)" /&gt; Some examples of deployments are the SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003, Rift Valley fever, and the nipah virus around the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="CDC Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/pdfs/atlanta/john_mackenzie.pdf |title=GOARN and One Health: Nipahvirus as a source of lessons learnt |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016 |author=John S. Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field missions overview===

Since its creation, GOARN cooperated with various other organizations to control outbreaks and improve national capacity to respond to diseases. A brief history of GOARN's work against international diseases is as follows. In 2000–2003, GOARN primarily responded to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever in Africa. It supported field investigation and outbreak containment. In 2003, GOARN helped to deploy international teams and helped to coordinate the response against SARS. In 2004, the network was one of the first to deploy against H5N1 influenza. In April–July 2005, GOARN helped to control Marburg Hemorrhagic fever in Angola. It carried out some "risk assessment and preparedness missions" in 2006, along with some response to human bird flu. In 2008/2009, GOARN responded to cholera in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Independent_Evaluation_of_GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/WHO_HSE_GCR_GOARN_2011_2.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=1 April 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author1=Egbert Sondorp |author2=Christoper Ansell |author3=Robert Hartley Stevens |author4=Emma Denton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and SARS===

GOARN played a role in containing the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. The network sent teams of experts in epidemiology, microbiology/virology, and infection control to Hanoi, Vietnam in March 14, 2003 and then Beijing China in March 25, 2003. GOARN assisted during this outbreak to not only study the outbreak and provide assistance, but also facilitate communication between the [[Department of Health (Hong Kong)]] and the WHO.&lt;ref name="SARS_Operational_Update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goarn/en/ |title=Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Operational Update |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest signs of the outbreak in China were reported February 11–24, when multiple people were reported to contract the disease. WHO was notified February 28 and then directly notified GOARN March 13. The first members of a WHO/GOARN outbreak control team arrived in Hong Kong March 14, followed by another 5-person GOARN team 12 days later. This second team transitioned to Guangdong, where they investigated the earliest cases of SARS and conducted interviews with health staff. The outbreak was declared by WHO to be contained by July 5.&lt;ref name="SARS_Chronology"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ |title= Update 95-SARS: Chronology of a serial killer |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, GOARN carried out many of the operations for the initial response to SARS through the mobilization of field teams. Also through GOARN, the WHO developed many international networks to create tools and standards for containing the epidemic. These networks communicated data by teleconference and use of secure websites for sharing of information.

Besides these networks and field teams, GOARN also assisted nations by directly providing assistance to affected areas and improving their capacity to respond to such threats in the future. GOARN's role in the outbreak was recognized by the World Health Assembly during the 56th Assembly in resolution WHA56.29.&lt;ref name="WHO_Response_to_SARS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92476/ |title=The WHO Response to SARS and Preparations for the Future |publisher= National Academies Press |accessdate= 30 October 2016 |author1=J.S. Mackenzie |author2=P. Drury |author3=A. Ellis |author4=T. Grein |author5=K.C. Leitmeyer |author6=S. Mardel |author7=A. Merianos |author8=B. Olowokure |author9=C. Roth |author10=R. Slattery |author11=G. Thomson |author12=D. Werker |author13=M. Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and Ebola===

On March 23, 2014, the first reports of Ebola in Guinea were reported by WHO's Regional Office in Africa. Five days later, the first GOARN team was sent to Guinea. This team found the situation to be quite severe and its findings were discussed in a press conference in Geneva April 8.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/one-year-report/who-response/en/ |title=Key Events in the WHO Response to the Ebola outbreak |date=1 January 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third week of April, WHO collaborated with GOARN to send a new medical team trained in infection prevention/control and intensive care to Guinea's principal hospital, Donka Hospital. Two weeks later, on May 5, WHO deployed experts, thirty three of whom were from GOARN, to West Africa to assist in the response to the outbreak. The outbreak was detected to have spread to Sierre Leone later in the month.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

On June 23, a GOARN steering committee session sent a message to WHO requesting for WHO to lead the response more strongly because it was the only agency with the resources and staff to do so.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

Over the course of the outbreak, the network deployed 895 experts, including "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilisation experts, emergency management and public health professionals." The network is still involved in the response to Ebola.&lt;ref name="GOARN_EBOLA_2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title= Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and cholera===
In Sierre Leone, GOARN has sent case management and laboratory experts from the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]] to help train the response capacity of health care and laboratory workers case management and diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Cholera_Sierra_Leone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Cholera in Sierra Leone-update (8 October 2012) |date=8 October 2012 | publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Iraq, the [[Syrian Civil War]] displaced many refugees into the Kurdistan. The refugee camps suffer from poor sanitation, which has led to cholera outbreaks in the region in 2007 and 2012. GOARN, as per the request of the [[Ministry of Health (Iraq)|Ministry of Health of Iraq]] for support and training in outbreak response, deployed a multidisciplinary team of six experts to the Northern Iraqian Dohuk and Erbil camps to assist with assessing the risk of cholera and other diseases as well as assisting MoH to prepare for response to the diseases.&lt;ref name="Northern_Iraq_Cholera"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ghdonline.org/yp-chronic/discussion/whogoarn-request-for-technical-assistance-for-chol/ |title=WHO/GOARN Request for technical assistance for Cholera Control in Northern Iraq |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=GHDonline |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author=Shushmita Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and H1N1===

GOARN supported countries and various other outbreak control organizations to fight against the H1N1 outbreak in the US and Mexico. The GOARN alert and request for assistance started in Mexico April 24, 2009. Over the course of the outbreak, GOARN helped the [[Pan American Health Organization]] coordinate and exchange information with the CDC and [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. It was provided with support and training from the Regional Office for the Western Pacific Response so that it could support regional offices in Manila and carry out field missions in Malaysia and Mongolia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27634">'''Global citizenship education''' ('''GCE''') is a form of [[civics|civic learning]] that involves students' active participation in projects that address [[global issue|global]] [[global issue|issue]]s of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are '[[global consciousness]]';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of [[supranational institution]], [[trade bloc|regional economic blocs]], and the development of [[information and communications technology|information and]] [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]]. These have allresulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students

== Definition and origins ==
[[Global citizenship]] consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status  or allegiance to an actual form of government.  The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the [[European Union|European]] [[European Union|Union]], and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education  programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent [[NGO]]s, [[grass roots]] organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] and [[UNESCO]].

The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, [[OXFAM]] UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education
which stressed "the 'active' role of global citizens".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE [[curricula]], to "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".

== Emergence and development ==
In the present era of [[globalization]], the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. No Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.

Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the  diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education".   In addition, global issues related to [[sustainability]], such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.

== Competences ==
While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. ''Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity);
* A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future);
* Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi-perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach);
* Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and con ict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and
* Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Most educators agree that "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, 2010:442&lt;/ref&gt; and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, "[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:14&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Melaville &amp; Berg et al, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that "harness […] the educational force of the wider culture".&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"&gt;Catalano, 2013:3&lt;/ref&gt; If students are encouraged "to see themselves as political agents",&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"/&gt; educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to  become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via [[Social network services|Social Network Services]], create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is  an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' ([[Global Issues Network]]), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"&gt;Dill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.

;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence'

Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' "features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Grudinski Hall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: "using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013: 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key learner attributes ==
GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education: topics and learning objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100102-4|location=|pages=20–21, 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed and critically literate ===
Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), [[media literacy]] and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Socially connected and respectful of diversity ===
Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethically responsible and engaged ===
Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to [[climate change]], [[consumerism]], [[Economic globalization|economic globalisation]], [[fair trade]], migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, [[terrorism]], war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== High Resolves, Australia ===
[https://highresolves.org/ High Resolves] is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum,'' England ===
In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum'', a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Activate, South Africa ===
'''Activate''' is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activateleadership.co.za/blog/5-mins-with-fernando#sthash.dRCXMqPx.dpuf|title=Activate Change Drivers|last=|first=|date=|website=Activate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Peace First, United States and Colombia ===
Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

== Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ==
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.
* foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both GCE and ESD help learners understand the interconnected world in which they live and the complexities of the global challenges faced.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2010. Teaching and Learning for a Sustainable Future: A multimedia teacher education programme. UNESCO, Paris. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_d/mod22.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; GCE and ESD help learners to develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes and values so that they can address these challenges responsibly and effectively now and in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002468/246888e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for teachers|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100180-2|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

== Objections ==

Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.&lt;ref name="Schattle, 2008"&gt;Schattle, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; Dill,&lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; for example, claims that "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:33&lt;/ref&gt; so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, taking into account [[cultural differences]] and country-specific conditions, it deals with the [[epidemiology]] of [[mental disorder]]s in different countries, their treatment options, mental health education, political and financial aspects, the structure of mental [[health care]] systems, [[Health human resources|human resources]] in mental health, and [[human rights]] issues among others.

The overall aim of the field of global mental health is to strengthen mental health all over the world by providing information about the mental health situation in all countries, and identifying mental health care needs in order to develop cost-effective interventions to meet those specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0|pmid= 17804063|year= 2007|author1= Prince|first1= M|title= No health without mental health|journal= Lancet|volume= 370|issue= 9590|pages= 859–77|last2= Patel|first2= V|last3= Saxena|first3= S|last4= Maj|first4= M|last5= Maselko|first5= J|last6= Phillips|first6= M.

Mental, [[neurological]], and substance use disorders make a substantial contribution to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] (GBD).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bod/en/index.html ''Global burden of disease'']. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a global measure of so-called [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population.  [[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among [[non-communicable disease]]s, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than [[cardiovascular disease]] or [[cancer]]. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of [[mental disorders]] to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness.

Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include [[unipolar depression]], [[alcoholism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar depression]] and [[dementia]]. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/mhtargeting/development_targeting_mh_summary.pdf ''Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment gap ==
It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/index.html ''Mental disorders affect one in four people.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high.  This so-called "treatment gap" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries.

Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=Vaughan|title=Mental Health Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/mental-health-diplomacy-building-global-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X|title=Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9593|pages=1164–1174|year=2007|last1=Saraceno|first1=Benedetto|last2=Van Ommeren|first2=Mark|last3=Batniji|first3=Rajaie|last4=Cohen|first4=Alex|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Mahoney|first6=John|last7=Sridhar|first7=Devi|last8=Underhill|first8=Chris | pmid = 17804061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000
nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. (2011). [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries'']. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions ==
Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available.  Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle-income countries that [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[psychosocial]] interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use.

Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2001'']],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001) [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/index.html ''The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on mental health:

# Provide treatment in primary care
# Make [[psychotropic drug]]s available
# Give care in the community
# Educate the public
# Involve communities, families and consumers
# Establish national policies, programs and [[legislation]]
# Develop [[Health Human Resources|human resources]]
# Link with other sectors
# Monitor community mental health
# Support more research

Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/''Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account.

For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high-income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service.

==Prevention==

Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-areas/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Research Areas|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==

=== World Health Organization (WHO) ===

Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives.  These are:
#  Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet)
#  Mental health policy, planning and service development
#  Mental health human rights and legislation
#  Mental health as a core part of human development
#  The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders.

The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010.  It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings.  The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.

== Criticism ==

One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book ''Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World''.

Mills writes that:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mills, China. [https://www.academia.edu/4905979/Decolonizing_Global_Mental_Health_The_Psychiatrization_of_the_Majority_World Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World]. Retrieved October 17, 2014, from&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=This book charts the creeping of psychology and psychiatry across the borders of everyday experience and across geographical borders, as a form of colonialism that comes from within and from outside, swallowed in the form of a pill. It maps an anxious space where socio-economic crises come to be reconfigured as individual crisis – as 'mental illness'; and how potentially violent interventions come to be seen as 'essential' treatment.|sign=|source=}}

Another prominent critic is Ethan Watters, author of ''Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Watters, Ethan (January 8, 2010).

'''Global surveillance whistleblowers''' are [[whistleblowers]] who provided public knowledge of [[global surveillance]].

==Perry Fellwock==
[[Perry Fellwock]] revealed the existence of then ultra secretive [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its global mass surveillance apparatus and activities, including domestic spying, in a 1971 ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' exposé. This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate [[Church Committee]] to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Adrian Chen|Chen, Adrian]] |title=After 30 Years of Silence, the Original NSA Whistleblower Looks Back |url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RZZIrx96?url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |archivedate=2014-08-04 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russ Tice==
In December 2005 [[Russ Tice]] helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005.&lt;ref name=abc2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Brian|title=NSA Whistleblower Alleges Illegal Spying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1491889|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=10 January 2006|quote=The same day ''The New York Times'' broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without warrants, Tice surfaced as a whistleblower in the agency.

==Mark Klein==
[[Mark Klein]] is a former [[AT&amp;T]] technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, [[Data Capture|capture]], and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006.

In recognition of his actions, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = AT&amp;T Whistle-Blower Among Award Winners |first = Anick |last = Jesdanun |date = Feb 27, 2008 |work = |accessdate =Nov 27, 2011 |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/02/27/1329579-att-whistle-blower-among-award-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&amp;T. Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Mark Klein, unredacted (June 8, 2006)|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/SER_klein_decl.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, and was the subject of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues [[J. Kirk Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]], in cooperation with [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] staffer [[Diane Roark]].

==Thomas Tamm==
[[Thomas Tamm]] is a former attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless NSA surveillance]] that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to ''The New York Times'', making the initial disclosure regarding the issue.

==Thomas Drake==
[[Thomas Andrews Drake]] is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[United States Navy]] (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake "mishandled" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the [[Trailblazer Project]].&lt;ref name=shane3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/us/16indict.html |title=Former N.S.A.

==Edward Snowden==
[[Edward Snowden]] is an American computer specialist, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee, who, while working as a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] contractor, disclosed [[Classified information|top secret]] NSA documents to various media outlets, initiating the [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|NSA leaks]], which reveal operational details of a [[global surveillance]] apparatus run by the NSA and other members of the [[Five Eyes]] alliance, along with numerous commercial and international partners.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Whistleblower Edward Snowden on Global Spying|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=December 18, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of classified material was called the most significant leak in US history by [[Pentagon Papers]] leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. A [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|series of exposés]] beginning June 5, 2013 revealed Internet surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]], as well as the interception of US and European telephone [[metadata]], among other disclosures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13758">'''Glocalization''' (a [[portmanteau]] of [[globalization]] and [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]) is the "simultaneous occurrence of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies in contemporary social, political, and economic systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/glocalization|title=Glocalization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of glocalization "represents a challenge to simplistic conceptions of globalization processes as linear expansions of territorial scales. Glocalization indicates that the growing importance of continental and global levels is occurring together with the increasing salience of local and regional levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/glocalization|title=Glocalization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term first appeared in a late 1980s publication of the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = Chanchal Kumar | year = 2009 | title = Emerging Dimensions of Decentralisation Debate in the Age of Globalisation | journal = Indian Journal of Federal Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 47–65 | ssrn=1369943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1997 conference on "Globalization and Indigenous Culture", sociologist [[Roland Robertson]] stated that glocalization "means the simultaneity – the co-presence – of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/glocalization |title=What is glocalization? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchcio.techtarget.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glocal''', an adjective, by definition, is "reflecting or characterized by both local and global considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glocal|title=glocal {{!}} Definition of glocal in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variety of uses==
*Individuals, households and organisations maintaining interpersonal [[social networks]] that combine extensive local and long-distance interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, "Little Boxes, Glocalization, and Networked Individualism." Pp. 11-25 in Digital Cities II, edited by Makoto Tanabe, Peter van den Besselaar, and Toru Ishida. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The declaration of a specified locality – a town, city, or state – as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale: a process that started in [[France]] in 1950 and originally called [[mundialization]].

==History of the concept==
The concept comes from the Japanese word ''dochakuka,'' which means global localization. It had referred to the adaptation of farming techniques to local conditions. It became a [[buzzword]] when Japanese business adopted it in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Habibul Haque Khondker, "Glocalization as Globalization: Evolution of a Sociological Concept," ''Bangladesh e-Journal of Sociology''. Vol. 1. No. 2. July, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051210071702/http://www.bangladeshsociology.org/Habib%20-%20Glocalization.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The word stems from Manfred Lange,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyi.ac.cy/user/25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913015844/http://www.cyi.ac.cy/user/25|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; head of the German National Global Change Secretariat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/Umweltforschung/lange.htm |title=Prof. Lange |publisher=Uni-muenster.de |accessdate=2013-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115304/http://www.uni-muenster.de/Umweltforschung/lange.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used "glocal" in reference to [[Heiner Benking]]'s exhibit: Blackbox Nature: [[Rubik's Cube]] of [[Ecology]] at an international science and policy conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html |title=On dialogue, knowledge, creativity, (cyber)culture, learning, wholeness |publisher=Benking.de |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benking.de/Global-Change/system-earth-posters.html |title=Section: System Earth from the exhibition GLOBAL CHANGE: Challenges to Science and Politics - Welt im Wandel - Herausforderungen für Wissenschaft und Politik |publisher=Benking.de |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term entered use in the English-speaking world via Robertson in the 1990s, Canadian sociologists [[Keith Hampton]] and [[Barry Wellman]] in the late 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman and Keith Hampton, "Living Networked On and Offline" ''Contemporary Sociology'' 28, 6 (Nov, 1999): 648-54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zygmunt Bauman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Keith and B Wellman. 2002. "The Not So Global Village of Netville", in [[Barry Wellman]] and [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] (eds), ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 345–371.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Swyngedouw]] was another early adopter.&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. ''Postmetroplis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2000), 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, glocalization has been productively theorized by several [[Sociology|sociologists]] and other social scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, Victor (2016). ''Glocalization: A Critical Introduction'' (New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt; and may be understood as a process that combines the concerns of localism&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Mark; David Marsh &amp; Gerry Stoker (2013). "Understanding localism". ''Policy Studies'', 34:4, 401–407, DOI: 10.1080/01442872.2013.822699.&lt;/ref&gt; with the forces of globalization, or a local adaptation and interpretation of global forces. As a theoretical framework, it is compatible with many of the concerns of [[Postcolonial Theory|postcolonial theory]],&lt;ref&gt; Go, J. (2016). ''Postcolonial Thought and Social Theory'' (New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and its impact is particularly recognizable in the [[digitization]] of music&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. &amp; Rykowski, M. (Eds.), ''Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age'' (Cambridge Scholars, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, F., &amp; S. Kenderdine (2007). ''Theorizing Digital Cultural heritage: A Critical Discourse''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In business==

===Challenges===
Glocalization works best for companies which have decentralized authority.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|date=1994-03-01|title=The business of international business is culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0969593194900116|journal=International Business Review|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/0969-5931(94)90011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to the companies increases as they cannot standardise products and projects, different cultures have different needs and wants which is highlighted in this challenge. An example of a company succeeding in creating new products for their emerging market is [[McDonald's]] new rice meals in [[India]] and [[China]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Xiuhua|date=2013-06-01|title=The Glocalization of English A Chinese Case Study|url=http://jds.sagepub.com/content/29/2/89|journal=Journal of Developing Societies|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=89–122|doi=10.1177/0169796X13480442|issn=0169-796X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that McDonald's has done research on and understands their new market's requirements for a successful takeaway food. This however can be very costly and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Starbucks at the Forbidden City.jpg|thumb|Starbucks in Forbidden City, China]]
An example of a global business that has faced challenges due to localization of their products can be presented through the closing of a [[Starbucks]] in the [[Forbidden City]] of China in 2007. Starbuck's attempt to localize into the culture of China by accommodating their menu to local elements such as serving "[[green tea]] [[frappuccino]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s" and enlarging their stores was prevalent in most areas of China, but when Starbucks spread to the Forbidden City, a problem surrounding cultural identity arose. Factors surrounding "western influences" related to Starbucks were seen as a threat by a web-based campaign who was successful in initiating the closing of the Starbucks in the Forbidden City. The leader of this web-based campaign, whose name is Rui, in his words had stated "All I want is that Starbucks move out of the Forbidden City peacefully and quietly, and we'll continue enjoying Starbucks coffee elsewhere in the city." &lt;ref&gt;Han, Gang (Kevin); Zhang, Ai (2009-11-01). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811109001271 "Starbucks is forbidden in the Forbidden City: Blog, circuit of culture and informal public relations campaign in China"]. ''Public Relations Review''. Includes a Special Section: Public Relations in a Time of Economic Crisis. '''35''' (4): 395–401. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.07.004|10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.07.004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many challenges to globalisation when done right it has many benefits, allowing companies to reach a larger target market is just one of them. Society also benefits when globalisation occurs as an increase in market competition generally pushes the price of products down which means the consumers benefit by gaining a lower price point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osland|first=Joyce S.|date=2003-06-01|title=Broadening the Debate The Pros and Cons of Globalization|url=http://jmi.sagepub.com/content/12/2/137|journal=Journal of Management Inquiry|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1177/1056492603012002005|issn=1056-4926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the inequality gap as people who couldn't previously afford products when the market was controlled by local monopolies are able to purchase the product for cheaper.

Although globalisation has benefits to the consumer it does not always benefit the producer with newer and smaller companies struggling to keep up with the low production costs of the multi-national competitors. This results in either a higher price and loss of consumers or a lower [[profit margin]] which in turn results in less competition within the market.&lt;ref name="BrooksNormore" /&gt;

==In education==
Glocalization of education has been proposed in the specific areas of politics, economics, culture, teaching, information, organization, morality, spirituality, religion and "temporal" [[literacy]].{{Clarify|reason=What the heck is temporal literacy?|date=March 2016}} The recommended approach is for local educators to consult global resources for materials and techniques and then adapt them for local use. For example, in information, it involves advancing computer and media understanding to allow students and educators to look beyond their local context.&lt;ref name="BrooksNormore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Jeffrey|year=2010|title=Educational Leadership and Globalization: Literacy for a Glocal Perspective|journal=Educational Policy|volume=24|issue=1|pages=52–82|doi=10.1177/0895904809354070|author2=Normore, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
[[Thomas Friedman]] in ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' talks about how the Internet encourages glocalization, such as encouraging people to make websites in their [[native languages]].

'''&lt;big&gt;Television&lt;/big&gt;'''

Besides the usage of [[Internet]], television and commercials have become useful strategies that global companies have used to help localize their products. Companies, such as McDonald's, have relied on television and commercials in not only the Western Hemisphere but in other parts of the world to attract a varying ranges of audiences in accordance to the demographic of the local area. For example, they have used mascots ranging anywhere from a male clown in the Western Hemisphere to attract younger audiences to an "attractive" female clown in Japan to attract older audiences.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Crawford, A., S. A. Humphries &amp; M. M. Geddy (2015). "McDonald's: A Case Study in Glocalization". ''Journal of Global Business Issues'', ''9''(1), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107062">[[File:Schooner Wyoming, 1917.JPG|thumb|The American six-masted [[schooner]] {{ship||Wyoming|ship|2}}, the longest confirmed wooden ship in history.]]
This is a list of the world's '''longest wooden ships'''. The vessels are sorted by ship length including [[bowsprit]], if known.

Finding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.

A further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the "length of the topmost deck" – the "length on deck" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the "length between perpendiculars" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including [[jibboom]] and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The longest length for comparing ships, the total "[[Length overall|overall]]" length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.

The longest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted New England gaff schooner ''Wyoming'', had a "total length" of {{convert|137|m|ft}} (measured from tip of jib boom (30 metres) to tip of spanker boom (27 metres) and a "length on deck" of {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}-difference is due to her extremely long jib boom of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} her out-board length being {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

According to one scholar, "nationalist resistance to global liberalism turned out to be the most influential force in Western politics" in 2016.&lt;ref name="Movesian"/&gt; Particularly notable expressions of new nationalism include the [[United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as the 45th [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="economist new nationalism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persaud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushkoff"/&gt;

==Overview and characteristics==
Writing for ''[[Politico]]'', Michael Hirsh described new nationalism as "a bitter [[Populism|populist]] rejection of the status quo that global elites have imposed on the international system since the [[Cold War]] ended, and which lower-income voters have decided—understandably—is unfair."&lt;ref name="Hirsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote in ''[[The Week]]'' that new nationalism is a "broad [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] revolt" against post-Cold War politics long "characterized by an orthodoxy of [[free trade]], nurturing the [[service economy]], [[neoliberal]] trading arrangements, and liberalized immigration policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dougherty|first1=Michael Brendan|title=A new nationalism is rising. Don't let Donald Trump destroy it.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/638440/new-nationalism-rising-dont-let-donald-trump-destroy|work=The Week|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in November 2016 that "new nationalists are riding high on promises to close borders and restore societies to a past homogeneity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=League of nationalists|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21710276-all-around-world-nationalists-are-gaining-ground-why-league-nationalists|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Page]] wrote in the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' that "a new neo-tribal nationalism has boiled up in European politics and to a lesser degree in the United States since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global economic meltdown of 2008]],"&lt;ref name="lasvegassun"/&gt; and Ryan Cooper in ''The Week''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theweek.com/articles/685813/great-recession-clearly-gave-rise-rightwing-populism|title=The Great Recession clearly gave rise to right-wing populism|author=Ryan Cooper|date=15 March 2017|work=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers with the [[Centre for Economic Policy Research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/political-aftermath-financial-crises-going-extremes|title=The political aftermath of financial crises: Going to extremes|author1=Manuel Funke|author2=Moritz Schularick|author3=Christoph Trebesch|website=Voxeu.org|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have linked 21st-century [[right-wing populism]] to the [[Great Recession]]. According to Harvard political theorist [[Yascha Mounk]], "economic stagnation among lower- and middle-class whites [has been] a main driver for nationalism's rise around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Detrow|first1=Scott|title=From 'Brexit' To Trump, Nationalist Movements Gain Momentum Around World|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/25/483400958/from-brexit-to-trump-nationalist-movements-gain-momentum-around-world|agency=[[NPR]]|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to religion scholar Mark L. Movesian, new nationalism "sets the nation-state against supranational, liberal regimes like the EU or NAFTA, and local customs and traditions, including religious traditions, against alien, outside trends."&lt;ref name="Movesian"/&gt;

[[David Brog]] and [[Yoram Hazony]] wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' that some conservatives view the new nationalism associated with [[Brexit]] and [[Donald Trump]] as a betrayal of [[Conservatism|conservative]] ideology while they see it as a "return".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brog|first1=David|last2=Hazony|first2=Yoram|authorlink1=David Brog|authorlink2=Yoram Hazony|title=The Nationalist Spirit of 2016: A Conservative Spring|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442826/conservatives-nationalists-2106-brexit-donald-trump-internationalism|work=[[National Review]]|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conservative commentator [[Jonah Goldberg]], the nationalism associated with Trump is "really little more than a brand name for generic white [[identity politics]]."&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;

Writing for ''The Week'', Damon Linker called the idea of neo-nationalism being racist "nonsense" and went on to say that "the tendency of progressives to describe it as nothing but 'racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia'—is the desire to delegitimize any particularistic attachment or form of solidarity, be it national, linguistic, religious, territorial, or ethnic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/649886/liberals-keep-denigrating-new-nationalism-racist-nonsense|title=Liberals keep denigrating the new nationalism as racist. This is nonsense.|date=21 September 2016|website=Theweek.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding new nationalism, ''The Economist'' said that "Mr Trump needs to realise that his policies will unfold in the context of other countries’ jealous nationalism," and called nationalism itself a "slippery concept" that is "easy to manipulate". They also repeatedly contrasted [[ethnic nationalism]] and [[civic nationalism]] and implied new nationalism could become "angry" and difficult to control, citing [[Chinese nationalism]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21710249-his-call-put-america-first-donald-trump-latest-recruit-dangerous|title=The new nationalism|website=Economist.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong nationalism evolved from the [[localism in Hong Kong|localist movement]] in Hong Kong stresses the distinct Hong Kong identity as opposed to Chinese national identity promoted by the Beijing government and its growing encroachment on the city's management of its own political, economic and social affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong suffers identity crisis as China's influence grows|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/china-hong-kong-identity-crisis|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Localism: Why is support for the political perspective growing - and who's behind it?|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/73236/localism-why-is-support-for-the-political-perspective-growing-and-whos-behind-it.html|website=Timeout.com.hk|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The localist rhetorics, often mix with the nation's [[right to self-determination]] as well as anti-immigration stances against [[new immigrants in Hong Kong|mainland immigrants]] and tourists, preserving local identity and culture similar to the Western new nationalism.

'''Refeudalization''' is the process of recovering mechanisms and relationships that used to define [[feudalism]]. Because the term "feudalism" is slightly ambiguous, "refeudalization" is ambiguous, too.

In the modern era, the term "refeudalization" is used for policies that give special privileges to organized groups such as [[NGO]]s.

== Refeudalization in seventeenth-century European historiography ==
The process of '''refeudalization''' is also used in seventeenth-century European historiography. The term was made famous by Italian Marxist historians [[Ruggiero Romano]] and [[Rosario Villari]], to illuminate the social conditions behind the Neapolitan Revolt of 1647. The concept was influenced by Gramsci's ideas, the historigraphical debates during the 1950s and 1960s that centered on Eric Hobsbawm's seventeenth century "[[General Crisis]]" as well as 1960s Italian politics. Villari used it quite specifically in reference to the increasing pressure in the six decades preceding the revolt of 1647, in which the peasantry and the lower-middle classes revolted against the feudal aristocracy and international financiers. The process was triggered by the royal state's need for money. The Spanish crown ennobled the bourgeoisie of rich merchants and financiers, who infiltrated and reinforced the noble order. [[Fernand Braudel]] found the “clearest case of refeudalization” in Spanish Naples. The monarchy had raised capital by selling feudal titles, which in the  long term increased the fiscal burden that the seigneurial regime imposed on the rural poor, since the nobles were exempted from paying taxes to the viceroyal regime. Refeudalization in a more general sense has been used to explain Italy's failed transition to modern capitalism. Though Italy had pioneered the commercial revolution, feudal barons neglected business opportunities to innovate and further rationalize the processes of production.

== Refeudalization in Habermas's theory of the public sphere ==
[[Jürgen Habermas]]’s theory of the [[public sphere]] is based on his research into the bourgeois class of the eighteenth century in Great Britain, France and Germany; his key work on the theme is ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' (1962). Habermas saw space that had been gained for the public around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries returning to private hands, a process which he called 'the refeudalization [''Refeudalisierung''] of the public spehere': 'Habermas discussed the pincer-like movement in which late modern [[consumer capitalism]] attempts to turn us into unthinking mass consumers on one hand, while political actors, interest groups, and the state try to turn us into unthinking mass citizens on the other'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 285).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habermas's idea of the 'public sphere' ===
For Habermas, the 'public sphere' is 'a space in which all citizens can critically, substantively, and rationally debate public policy' (though this does not necessarily exist in any single physical space: it can also be constituted, for example, by newspapers).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In its ideal form, the public sphere is "made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state".
The public sphere is the source of public opinion needed to "legitimate authority in functioning democracy". Habermas made a distinction between ''[[lifeworld]]'' and ''system''. The public sphere is part of the lifeworld and it is the immediate setting of the individual social actor, and Habermas opposed any analysis which uncoupled the interdependence of the lifeworld.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"&gt;Habermas, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1962 (1990), p 292. ("The Structural Change of The Public Sphere"), translation Walter Kastorp (expressly for Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas's analysis is based on an oral bias; he believed that the public sphere can be most effectively constituted and maintained through dialogue, acts of speech, debate and discussion. In his further reflections, Habermas claims that public debate can be animated by “opinion-forming associations” which are voluntary associations, social organizations such as from churches, sports clubs, groups of concerned citizens, grassroots movements, trade unions – to counter or refashion the messages of authority.
This public sphere began to form first in Britain at the end of the seventeenth century. It resulted in the Licensing Act (1695), which allowed newspapers to print what they want without the Queen’s censorship. However, there were still strict laws. But the sphere is seen as a crucial enabler for this to happen.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"/&gt;

=== The refeudalization of the public sphere ===
For Habermas, a key feature of the feudal is that small numbers of individuals embodied the public state: a king or similar officer ''was'' the realm (what Habermas called 'representative publicity'). Habermas saw the eighteenth-century bourgeois public sphere as a positive contrast to this situation. But in the twentieth century, he perceived the rise of advertising, marketing and 'public relations' trying to manipulate the public and discourage critical thought, and he perceived the state, political parties, and interest groups increasingly using the same approaches to win votes. This is 'refeudalization' because 'the public sphere becomes the court &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;before&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; whose public prestige can be displayed─rather than &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;in&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; which public critical debate is carried on'.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''The Transformation of the Public Sphere'', p. 201, quoted by Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 287).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Publicity once meant the exposure of political domination before public reasoning; ''publicity'' [here Habermas uses the English word] sums up the reactions of a non-binding goodwill. The bourgeois public sphere readopts feudal qualities in proportion to its formation by ''public relations'' [in English]: the "offering agents" display representative expenditure in front of compliant customers. Publicity imitates that aura of personal prestige and preternatural authority which the representative public sphere had once imparted.

A "refeudalization" of the public sphere must be discussed in another, more exact sense. The integration of mass entertainment and advertising, which in the form of public relations already assumes a "political" character, subjugates namely even the state under its code. Because private companies suggest to their customers in consumer decisions the consciousness of citizens, the state has to "appeal to" its citizens like consumers. Thus the public use of violence also solicits publicity.

Some recent commentators have argued that the politics of twenty-first century America,&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The Smugglers: The Rationality of Political Satire in the 2014 Elections', ''PS: Political Science &amp; Politics'', 49.1 (January 2016), 48-52. DOI: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S104909651500126&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the West more generally,&lt;ref&gt;Alain Supiot; The public–private relation in the context of today’s refeudalization, ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'', Volume 11, Issue 1, 1 January 2013, Pages 129–145, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/mos050&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; take further the trends observed by Habermas.

== Refeudalization in sociology of neoliberal globalization ==
There is a third context which sociologists, drawing on Habermas, refer to contemporary socio-economic processes in the global economy as refeudalization. The concepts overlap with discussions of [[neomedievalism]]. The Swiss sociologist [[Jean Ziegler]] uses the German expression "Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft" to illuminate the forces behind [[neoliberal]] [[globalization]]. In his pamphlet "[[The Empire of Shame]]", he criticizes the new system of "Refeudalisierung" based on [[scarcity]] and debt. However, the concept in English is typically translated as the "new feudalization", which here means the subversion of Enlightenment values (freedom, equality and brotherhood) and the radical [[privatization]] of [[public goods]] and services.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Ziegler, ''L'empire de la honte'' (Fayard, 2005), {{ISBN|978-2213623993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schutte, '[https://archiv.attacberlin.de/ags/argumente/text-refeudalisierung/ Was ist: »Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft"?]', ''attacBerlin'' (26.2.2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable ideas have been developed by Sighard Neckel.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, '[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]', MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly seen transnational organized crimes are [[money laundering]]; [[human smuggling]]; [[cyber crime]]; and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of humans]], drugs, weapons, kidnapping, people smuggling, [[Poaching|endangered species]], body parts, or [[nuclear material]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Prior to [[World War I]], several organizations were created to formalize international police cooperation, but most quickly failed, primarily because public police institutions were not sufficiently detached from the political centers of their respective states to function autonomously as expert bureaucracies.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureaucratization and Social Control: Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation|jstor=3115142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, the First International Criminal Police Congress was held in Monaco, which saw police officers, lawyers and magistrates from 24 countries meeting to discuss arrest procedures, identification techniques, centralized international criminal records and extradition proceedings. This organization appeared poised to avoid the political forces that ended earlier organizations, but the outbreak of World War I disorganized the Congress.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Criminal Police|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1951-01-01_3_page003.html|website=UNODC|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, a second International Criminal Police Congress was held in Vienna, on the initiative of Mr. Hans Schober, President of the Austrian police. Schober, eager to avoid the politics that doomed previous international police efforts, noted that ''"ours is not a political but a cultural goal. It only concerns the fight against the common enemy of humankind: the ordinary criminal."''&lt;ref name=JSTOR /&gt; This second Congress created the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), which served as the direct forerunner of Interpol.&lt;ref name=Interpol&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Interpol|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/History|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members included police officials from Russia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrials.net/documents/Interpol_-_FAQs.pdf |title=Interpol: Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Fair Trials International]] |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the ICPC's General Assembly, held in Berlin, proposed that each country establish a central point of contact within its police structure: the forerunner of the National Central Bureau (NCB).&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; In 1938, the Nazis assumed control of the ICPC and most countries stop participating, effectively causing the ICPC to cease to exist as an international organization.

After World War II, Belgium led the rebuilding of the organization, with a new headquarters in Paris and a new name - [[Interpol]]. The United Nations did not recognize Interpol as an intergovernmental organization until 1971.&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; On June 17, 1971, President Nixon declared ''"America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks About an Intensified Program for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control. June 17, 1971|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3047|website=The American Presidency Project|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this declaration, the United States began the [[War on Drugs]]. At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wechsler|first1=William|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/pdf/WechslerPrepared20120426.pdf|website=Washington Institute|publisher=The Washington Institut for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], former Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, "as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper."&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt;

==Effects==
Transnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt [[free market]]s, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In doing so, it has been argued{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and stability{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of nations worldwide, often using [[bribery]], violence, or terror to meet their needs.

TOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, ''"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy."''&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for '''combating''' this transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise I. Shelley (Director of the [[Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center]] at [[George Mason University]]) has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/traccc/] (This article incorporates text from the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is believed to be in the [[public domain]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Combating transnational organized crime==
Most illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the [[G8|G8 (forum)]]. In other words, the world’s largest trading partners are also the world’s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/strategy|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: [[electronic surveillance]], [[undercover operation]]s, and the use of [[confidential informant]]s (CIs),&lt;ref name=unafei&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Methods to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in Criminal Justice Processes |url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no58/58-05.pdf|website=UNAFEI|author=Ohr, Bruce G. |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations,&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}} followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; In many cases,{{which|date=October 2016}} CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}

==Enforcement in the United States==

===Tools of Prosecution=== 
The following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:
* [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]]
* [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force Units]]
* [[Legal immunity|Immunity System]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}
* [[Witness Protection|Witness Protection Programs]]
* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]{{dubious|date=October 2016}}
* [[Sentence (law)|Sentences]]

===White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime===
In May 2010, the [[White House]] released its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, ''"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SECURITY  STRATEGY: May 2010|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|website=The White House|publisher=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927091224/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[White House]] released its '''Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime''', which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy "''to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security—and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime: Executive Summary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/summary|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:

# ''Protect Americans and our partners from the harm, violence, and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.'' 
# ''Help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the corruptive power of transnational criminal networks, and sever state-crime alliances.'' 
# ''Break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from TOC penetration and abuse.'' 
# ''Defeat transnational criminal networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, by targeting their infrastructures, depriving them of their enabling means, and preventing the criminal facilitation of terrorist activities.''
# ''Build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.''

===Enforcement agencies of the United States===

====National Guard====
In keeping with the [[U.S. National Security Council]]'s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the [[National Guard Bureau]] established the CTOC [[Center of Excellence|Center of Excellence (COE)]] to educate and train [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], military services, [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTOC Center of Excellence|url=http://ctoc.gov|website=CTOC Center of Excellence|publisher=National Guard Burea|accessdate=2 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031024757/http://ctoc.gov/|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its [[Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training]] (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCTFT|url=http://mctft.org|website=MCTFT|publisher=National Guard Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Southern Command====
{{main|United States Southern Command}} As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, [[U.S. Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America. SOUTHCOM focuses on strengthening the security capacities of U.S. partners in Central America.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom&gt;{{cite web|title=Countering Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.southcom.mil/ourmissions/Pages/Countering%20Transnational%20Organized%20Crime.aspx|website=USSOUTHCOM|publisher=USSOUTHCOM|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary focus of SOUTHCOM CTOC efforts is supporting the interdiction of drug trafficking. SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection &amp; monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom /&gt;

====Department of Homeland Security====
Charged with securing the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2011/07/25/combating-transnational-organized-crime|website=Department of Homeland Security|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Department of State====
The [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL), an agency of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.&lt;ref name=DOS&gt;{{cite web|title=DoS CTOC efforts|url=https://www.state.gov/j/inl/|website=Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;

====Department of Treasury====
Established in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]'s efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.

In 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] ([[Yakuza]]) from Japan, and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug Enforcement Administration====
The strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime&lt;/ref&gt; The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.

====Federal Bureau of Investigation====
Law enforcement agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime—such as crimes against humanity—may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.

==International Enforcement Agencies==

===United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime===
On November 15, 2000, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name=UNTOC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime|url=http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/global-regime-transnational-crime/p28656|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.

{{citation needed span|text=A recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that Southeast Asia produced an estimated 48 tons of heroin in 2011. The vast majority of this cultivation – roughly twice that of Afghanistan, which arguably receives much greater attention – has occurred in the fragile state of Myanmar. The UN report estimated that the revenue generated from this trade to be worth $16.3 billion during the same period.

The revenues generated from such trafficking often lie at the root of instability and violence in the region. Additionally, the same routes used to smuggle drugs will likely be used to transport weapons and militants in the event that the current conflict expands. Reconciling the numerous armed ethnic groups that exist within Myanmar continues to be a challenge for the nascent government. A strong drug trade will only complicate negotiations between government officials and these groups.|date=October 2016}}

Combating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China’s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

UNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention’s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC’s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC’s overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

The UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

===Interpol===
The idea of the organization known today as [[Interpol]] was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is ''""Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters"''.&lt;ref name=Interpol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpol Overview|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.

The agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals.  Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

Like most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

===World Bank===
With a membership of 188 nations, the [[World Bank]] is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, "Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank", the author states that "the World Bank’s mandate appears to permit preventive action", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.&lt;ref name=WorldBank&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery and Human Trafficking  International Law and the  Role of the World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Labor-Market-DP/0904.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the detrimental impact on its mission{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

In another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR). This initiative helps to recover corruption related proceeds by creating an effective and collaborative environment for global law enforcement policy development.&lt;ref name=WorldBank /&gt;

===International Monetary Fund===
The [[International Monetary Fund]] also conducts assessments of anti-money laundering provisions in countries.&lt;ref name="UNTOC"/&gt;

===Europol===
[[Europol]] is the law enforcement agency of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. The organization does so by assisting the EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europol&gt;{{cite web|title=About Europol|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/page/about-europol-17|website=Europol|publisher=Europol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europol officers hold no authority to conduct arrests but they support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analyzing and disseminating information and coordinating operations. Europol uses the information to prevent, detect and investigate offenses, and to track down and prosecute those who commit them. Europol experts and analysts take part in Joint Investigation Teams which help solve criminal cases on the spot in EU countries.&lt;ref name=Europol /&gt;

===Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering===
The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)]], an initiative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to ''"set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system."'' To this end, the FATF developed a number of recommendations that have been recognized by law enforcement agencies around the world as the standard in the combating of TOC; specifically in the fight against money laundering, terror financing, and the proliferation of [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=FATF&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is FATF|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/aboutus/|website=FATF|publisher=FATF|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help combat CTOC, the FATF maintains a policy that has proven successful thus far, in which it "names and shames" that jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with FATF. It also enlists the help of cooperating countries in the crafting of legislative frameworks used in the effort to combat money laundering.&lt;ref name=FATF/&gt;

Turkey is also member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It has signed free trade agreements with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), Israel, and many other countries. In 1992, Turkey and 10 other regional nations formed the [[Black Sea Economic Cooperation Business Council]] to expand regional trade and economic cooperation.

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S. Sunga]] Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1453-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dpage.viewpage%26pageid%3D1638 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619091806/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1638 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[war crime]]s, [[torture]] and [[forced disappearance]]s.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/020/2001/en/|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers|access-date=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ''[[Institutes of Justinian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutes of Justinian'', Book I, Title II, "Concerning Natural Law, the Law of Nations, and the Civil Law".&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaius. ''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Eisenbrandt |author2=Katherine Gallagher |title=Halting Canadian Bush Prosecution Violated International Obligations|url=http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/01/eisenbrandt-gallagher-bush.php |work=[[Jurist]] | quote=Canada disregarded an opportunity to shatter the global impunity Bush enjoys and in so doing violated international law. |date=January 17, 2012  |accessdate=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the [[Convention Against Torture]], a petition on which action is pending.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"/&gt;

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R.

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v.

David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The following infractions may be prosecuted:
* Torture
* Terrorism
* Nuclear smuggling
* Naval piracy
* Airplane hijacking

===Germany===
{{Main|Völkerstrafgesetzbuch}}

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An offence is generally only triable in the jurisdiction where the offence took place, unless a specific statute enables the UK to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.

* Bribery (was s. 109 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]], now s. 12 of the [[Bribery Act 2010]])

In December 2009 a court in London issued an arrest warrant for [[Tzipi Livni]]  in connection with accusations of [[war crimes]] in the Gaza Strip during [[Operation Cast Lead]] (2008–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British court issued Gaza arrest warrant for former Israeli minister Tzipi Livni | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was issued on 12 December and revoked on 14 December 2009 after it was revealed that Livni had not entered British territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1134978.html |title=Foreign Ministry outraged over U.K. arrest warrant against Livni |newspaper=Haaretz |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was later denounced as "cynical" by the Israeli foreign ministry, while Livni's office said she was "proud of all her decisions in Operation Cast Lead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8413234.stm |publisher=BBC News | title = Israel condemns attempt in a UK court to arrest Livni|date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livni herself called the arrest warrant "an abuse of the British legal system".&lt;ref name="UK warrant"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8415123.stm |date=14 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 December 2009 |title=Tzipi Livni: UK warrant a legal 'abuse'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a January visit to Britain by a team of [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) was cancelled over concerns that arrest warrants would be sought by pro-Palestinian advocates in connection with allegations of [[war crimes]] under laws of universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest| title= Israeli military cancels UK visit over arrest fears |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's World Golf Rankings''', also known for sponsorship reasons as the '''[[Rolex]] Rankings''', were introduced in February 2006. They are sanctioned by eight women's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] and the organisations behind them: [[Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA Tour), [[Ladies European Tour]], [[Ladies Professional Golfers' Association of Japan]] (LPGA of Japan Tour), [[Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA of Korea Tour), [[Australian Ladies Professional Golf]] (ALPG Tour), [[Symetra Tour]], [[China LPGA Tour|China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour]], the [[LET Access Series|Ladies European Tour Access Series]] and also by the [[Ladies' Golf Union]], which administers the [[Women's British Open]] and the [[United States Golf Association]] which conducts the [[U.S. Women's Open]].

The idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005,&lt;ref name="rankingsplanned"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Women's World Rankings to begin in 2005
  | publisher = Golf Today
  | date = 2004
  | url = http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news04/womens_rankings.html
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but then put back to 2006.

==Calculation of the rankings==
The rankings are based on performances on the eight major tours (LPGA, JLPGA, KLPGA, LET, ALPG, Symetra Tour, LETAS, CLPGA) over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Ranking. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the five [[LPGA majors]] and all Symetra Tour, CLPGA and LETAS events, which have a fixed-point allocation. Rankings are tapered so the recent results are more important.

===Original formula===
When the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years. In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period to be included in the rankings.

===Formula revisions===
On 2 August 2006 the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula.&lt;ref name="aug2006rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Two modifications announced for Rolex Rankings
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 3 August 2006
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?mid=2&amp;pid=7574
  | accessdate =3 August 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The elimination of the minimum event requirement. Players would no longer be required to participate in 15 qualifying events to be included in the rankings and could be included after playing in as few as one qualifying event. This change would also have the effect of permitting amateurs who had played well in one event to be ranked (e.g., [[Morgan Pressel]], who finished second in the 2005 [[U.S. Women's Open]], or [[Michelle Wie]] from age 13).
# The introduction of a minimum divisor. Where previously a player's point total was divided by the number of events she played over the previous 104 weeks, now the player's point total would be divided by the greater of (i) the number of events played or (ii) 35. Thus, players with 35 or more events over the previous 104 weeks would continue to use the actual number of events played as the divisor, but players with fewer than 35 events would use 35 as the divisor.

Many commentators saw the latter change as directed at [[Michelle Wie]], who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period. However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.

On 16 April 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a stronger value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13 week decrements previously used.&lt;ref name="apr162007rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Modification Announced to Rolex Rankings Calculations
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 9 April 2007
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=10409&amp;mid=4
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.

==Criticisms==
When they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/b/a/245967.htm |title=First Women's World Golf Rankings Stir Up Controversy |last=Kelley |first=Brent |publisher=about.com |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable [[Michelle Wie]] to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings – that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament – Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than 15, Wie would not have been ranked at all.

The August 2006 revised formula addressed the second criticism. The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing "strength of the field" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.

==Significance of the rankings==
The rankings are used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. For example, 40 of the 144 places in the [[Women's British Open]] are currently awarded on the basis of the rankings—10 to LET members and 30 to LPGA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lgu.org/data/files/entry_2011_rwboconditions.pdf |title=Entry Form, 2011 Ricoh Women's British Open: Rules and Conditions |publisher=[[Ladies' Golf Union]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2011}} See especially "7. Exemptions from Pre-Qualifying and Final Qualifying", pages 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the 12 places in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team are allocated on the basis of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4918154.stm |title=Solheim selection process changes |work=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the rankings at the end of each LPGA Tour season in odd-numbered years have determined the eight countries that will compete in the following year's [[International Crown]], a LPGA-sponsored team event scheduled in even-numbered years and first held in 2014. More specifically, the countries whose top four players have the highest cumulative rankings are invited to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpga.com/golf/news/2013/1/global-announcement.aspx |title=32 Players, 8 Countries, 1 Crown: LPGA Unveils the International Crown |publisher=LPGA |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual participants from each qualified country are determined by the rankings immediately prior to the [[ANA Inspiration]] (known before 2015 as the Kraft Nabisco Championship) in the year of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpgainternationalcrown.com/golf/news/2013/7/international-crown-tickets.aspx |title=LPGA International Crown Celebrates "Year from Here" Event |publisher=LPGA |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''World Health Report''''' ('''WHR''') is a series of reports produced regularly by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). First published in 1995, the ''World Health Report'' is WHO's leading publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/publications/en/ World Health Organization: Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Published annually or biennially in multiple languages, each report includes an expert assessment of a specific [[global health]] topic, relating to all countries that are Member States of the organization. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/choice/demography/by_country/en/ World Health Organization: Alphabetical List of WHO Member States]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of the WHR is to provide policymakers, donor agencies, international organizations and others with the information they need to help them make appropriate [[health policy]] and funding decisions. However, the report is also accessible to a wider audience, such as universities, journalists and the public at large. It is expected that anyone, with a professional or personal interest in international health issues, will be able to read and take use of it.

== WHR 2013: Research for universal health coverage ==
[[Image:Monoclonal antibodies4.jpg|thumb|[[Cell culture]] vials.]]
The ''World Health Report 2013'' focuses on the importance of research in advancing progress towards [[Universal health care|universal health care coverage]] – in other words, full access to high-quality services for prevention, treatment and financial risk protection. The report advocates for increased international and national investment in research aimed specifically at improving coverage of health services within and between countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2013/main_messages/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''Main messages from World health report 2013: Research for universal health coverage.''] Last update 19 August 2013. Accessed 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of required research include [[medical research]], or investigating the causes of ill-health and the interventions needed to improve health and wellbeing, as well as [[health services research]], focusing on how to expand service coverage and reduce inequities in coverage.

== Previous reports ==
=== 2010: Health Systems Financing ===
The ''World Health Report 2010'' focused on the topic of [[Universal health care|universal health care coverage]], and how countries can modify their financing systems to move towards this goal. The report provided an action agenda for countries at all stages of development, and proposed ways that the international community can better support efforts in low-income countries to achieve universal coverage and improve [[population health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2010/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The world health report 2010 - Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008: Primary health care===
The theme of the ''World Health Report 2008'' was the renewal of [[primary health care]], and the need for [[health system]]s to respond better and faster to the health care challenges of a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2008/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The World Health Report 2008 - Primary Health Care (Now More Than Ever)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007: Global public health security ===
The main concern of the ''World Health Report 2007'' was how the world is at increasing risk of disease outbreaks, [[epidemic]]s, industrial accidents, natural disasters and other health emergencies which can rapidly become threats to global [[public health]] security. The report described how the new [[International Health Regulations]] help countries to work together to identify risks and act to contain and control them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2007/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The world health report 2007 - A safer future: global public health security in the 21st century'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006: Working together for health===
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified in WHR2006 with critical shortage of health workers]]
The ''World Health Report 2006'' (WHR2006) highlighted the estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, nurses, midwives, and other [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] worldwide, calling the situation a "global health workforce crisis". The report laid out a ten-year action plan for building national health workforces through better training, recruitment and management processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2006/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The World Health Report 2006 - working together for health'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005: Make every mother and child count===
The ''World Health Report 2005'' focused on the fact that almost 11 million children under five years of age die annually from causes that are largely preventable, and another half a million women die in [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]] or soon after. The report said that reducing this toll in line with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] would depend largely on every mother and every child having the right to access to [[health care]] from pregnancy through childbirth, the neonatal period and childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2005/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The World Health Report 2005 - make every mother and child count'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004: Changing history===
[[File:AIDS Clinic, McLeod Ganj, 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=A run down a two-story building with a number of signs related to AIDS prevention|AIDS Clinic, [[McLeod Ganj]], Himachal Pradesh, India]]
The topic of the ''World Health Report 2004'' was the global [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2004/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The world health report 2004 - changing history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003: Shaping the future===
The ''World health report 2003'' examined the [[global health]] situation and some of the major threats to health. The report advocated that major improvements in [[health for all]] were within reach, and that progress depended on collaboration among governments, international institutions, the private sector and civil society to build stronger health systems. 

===2002: Reducing risks, promoting healthy life===
The ''World health report 2002'' described the amount of [[disease]], [[disability]] and [[death]] in the world that could be attributed to a selected number of the most important [[risk factor|risks to human health]]. It projected how much this burden could lowered in the next 20 years if the same risk factors were reduced.

===2001: Mental health===
The largely neglected area of [[mental health]] was the core focus of the ''World health report 2001''.

===2000: Health systems: improving performance===
The ''World Health Report 2000'' introduced a conceptual framework and measurement approach to examine and compare aspects of [[health system]]s around the world, and better understand the complex factors that explain how health systems perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html World Health Organization: ''The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance."]&lt;/ref&gt; The report provided an [[WHO's ranking of health care systems|assessment of the performance of national health systems]] for all countries.
