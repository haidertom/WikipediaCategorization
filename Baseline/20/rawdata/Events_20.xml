The '''15th World Scout Jamboree''' was scheduled to be held 15–23 July 1979 and was to be hosted by [[Iran]] at [[Nishapur]], but was cancelled due to the [[Iranian Revolution]] which took place in 1979. 

The 15th World Jamboree was to be held at the 10 square kilometre [[Omar Khayyám]] Scout Park, near the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] and [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] borders. The [[Asia-Pacific Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)#Regional Scout Jamboree|Second Asia-Pacific Jamboree]] was held at the site in preparation, in the summer of 1977. However, the destabilizing events of the [[Islamic Revolution]] caused the 15th World Jamboree to be cancelled near the end of 1978. Instead, the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] announced the "World Jamboree Year" by holding several international World Jamboree Year camps in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]] that took up the momentum. However, a number of commemorative items had already been made for the event, the demand for which and the value of which was greatly inflated by the Jamboree's cancellation. The few items of memorabilia in existence are of huge value to collectors when they, albeit rarely, come on the market.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

The next Jamboree, hosted by Canada in 1983, was named ''The Spirit Lives On'' to show how Scouting's spirit of international brotherhood could overcome the setback of cancelling the 1979 Jamboree.

The '''1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident''', occurring on 14 September 1961, was an incident during the [[Cold War (1953–1962)|Cold War]], in which two [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|''JaBoG 32'']] of the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') crossed into East German [[airspace]] because of a navigational error, before landing at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. The two planes successfully evaded a large number of Soviet fighter planes by finding cover in a heavy layer of clouds,&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45139958.html STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the actions of an airman at the [[United States Air Force]] air route traffic control center at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] who ordered the planes on to Berlin rather than forcing them to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; The event came at a historically difficult time in relations between the two Germanies. Only a month before, the [[Berlin Wall]] had been built, which completely cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. It also came three days before the [[West German federal election, 1961|West German federal election]], held on 17 September 1961.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Background==
At the time, violations of airspace at the border between West and East Germany were common, with, on average, two aircraft a month belonging to members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) crossing into Eastern airspace while a much larger number of Soviet planes crossed into that of West Germany. There were 38 violations of West Germany's air space by Soviet aircraft in a period of just four weeks between August and September 1961. Some of the violations were deliberate, to determine the opposite side's reaction, while others were by mistake, caused by the difficulty in determining the border line from the air.&lt;ref name="Monat" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45141349.html LUFTZWISCHENFALL: Zweimal monatlich] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 29 August 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the end of the Second World War and the [[German reunification]], West German planes were not permitted to fly to West Berlin, regardless of whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The three existing [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to the city were only open to planes from the three wartime [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]: the United States, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Tages" &gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/angriffshoehe-800/394316.html Angriffshöhe 800] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', published: 2 March 2003, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 September 1961, under the code name ''Checkmate'', the [[NATO]] high command mobilised the air forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany for the purpose of an [[military exercise|exercise]]. As part of this exercise, the ''[[Jagdbomber]]''s of ''[[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|Jagdbombergeschwader (JaBoG) 32]]'', based at [[Lechfeld Airbase]], south of [[Augsburg]], were to fly a triangular route from [[Würzburg]] to [[Laon]] and then to [[Memmingen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two F-84 fighter-bombers, flown by [[Feldwebel]] Peter Pfefferkorn and [[Unteroffizier|Stabsunteroffizier]] Hans Eberl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qRFggA1sMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+Eberl+14+September+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DmhvySvrU0&amp;sig=fafOuilSu-d-gI-tp-thRCLE1m4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lOL1TKfHN4nprAfn0p32Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20Eberl%2014%20September%201961&amp;f=false Krieg um Berlin?: die sowjetische Militär- und Sicherheitspolitik] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Matthias Uhl, accessed: 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; lost their course in the process of flying this route, with the compass on Pfefferkorn's plane misreading by between 40 and 60 degrees. Additionally, a strong westerly wind was greater in strength than had been forecasted. On their way from Würzburg to Laon, the two pilots had become so disoriented that they mistook [[Liège]] in Belgium for [[Reims]] in France.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Shortly after, the pair were picked up by NATO radar stations near [[Warburg]], in southern [[Westphalia]], heading east, in the direction of [[Königs Wusterhausen]], south of Berlin. The two pilots missed a radio call from the radar stations advising them to turn around because they were talking to each other, trying to establish their location.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It was only when reaching a position north of [[Leipzig]], deep within East German air space, that Pfefferkorn sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] signal, which was picked up, to their surprise, by the French-controlled airport at Tegel in [[West Berlin]], which gave them permission to land. The planes had initially not been noticed by the radar operator at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] because he was concentrating on an incoming [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6]]. By the time they were noticed, the pair were being unsuccessfully chased by a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. An airman in the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center ordered the two pilots not to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes but instead to head for the Tegel airport as it had a longer runway than Tempelhof and was more suitable for jets.&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;[http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf 50 Jahre Jagdbombergeschwader 32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193436/http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} {{de icon}} 50 Years Jagdbombergeschwader 32, accessed; 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the actions of this airman and the heavy cloud cover, which the two pilots used to conceal themselves, Pfefferkorn and Eberl escaped the pursuing Soviet aircraft and successfully landed their planes without further incident at Tegel.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Reaction==
===International===
Immediately after the two aircraft landed, the French authorities at Tegel airport explained to the Soviet authorities in East Berlin that, because of technical difficulties, an [[emergency landing]] of the two planes had been absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The then-West German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Franz-Josef Strauß]], apologised to the Soviet ambassador in [[Bonn]] for the incident, sending his secretary of state, [[Volkmar Hopf]]. The government of the Soviet Union remained silent for a number of days with regards to the incident, before officially protesting against the West German "provocation" and threatening to shoot down any aircraft involved if the incident was repeated.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Soviet air command in East Germany was less than impressed with the 'unpunished' flight of two Western fighter planes through their airspace. However, it chose to blame bad weather for the incident rather than the failure of its ground control to guide the Soviet fighter planes on to the West German ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RYYuSGcwq5AC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+and+Eberl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHqzsIhtcf&amp;sig=by3WlbzluCGCPMVwWI0WHSU6Fwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8P70TIfGFsGecfmj4dcE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20and%20Eberl&amp;f=false Vor dem Abgrund: die Streitkräfte der USA und der UdSSR] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Dimitrij N. Filippovych, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0033, Josef Kammhuber retusche.jpg|thumb|200px|Josef Kammhuber]]
[[Willy Brandt]], the leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in the upcoming federal elections, and the mayor of West Berlin, questioned how the two pilots could be put in a situation where they would be forced to violate international conventions in a time of strained relations between the East and the West. Initially, Strauß announced a stringent investigation into the incident; instead, however, he and [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], transferred the commander of ''JaBoG 32'', [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Siegfried Barth]], and announced that any commander whose unit committed a violation of international borders would be immediately replaced.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

When Kammhuber announced this order at Lechfeld the following day, it was dubbed ''Bier Order 61'' (''Beer Order 61'') because it was formulated late at night over drinks between Kammhuber and Strauß. Barth, commander of ''JaBoG 32'', was not questioned with regard to the incident, and was not allowed to speak during Kammhuber's visit. Instead, [[Generalleutnant]] [[Martin Harlinghausen]], Barth's superior officer, who had once, in 1944, stood up to [[Hermann Göring]], spoke for Barth and demanded a proper investigation.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two weeks later, Harlinghausen was forced into early retirement. The non-commissioned officers of ''JaBoG 32'' sent a letter to Strauß requesting that Barth should retain his command, without receiving any answer. Eventually, a proper investigation was conducted which found Barth to be innocent, a result unacceptable to Kammhuber, who initiated a second investigation that found the ''Oberstleutnant'' partly at fault. A third investigation followed, which again found Barth to be innocent. Oberstleutnant Barth then lodged an official complaint against Franz-Josef Strauß. Strauß, as minister of defence, ordered all witnesses in the case - Generals Kammhuber, Harlinghausen, [[Werner Panitzki]] and [[Werner Streib]] as well as Lieutenant Colonels [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Walter Grasemann]] - [[gag order|not to speak]], as they were all military personnel and therefore under his command. Nevertheless, his conduct in dismissing Barth was found to be at fault, and the latter had to be reinstated in his position. Strauß, however, ignored this decision until [[Hellmuth Heye]], [[Ombudsman]] for the Military, forced him to accept it.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; Strauß himself was later forced to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, in the wake of the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' scandal]] in 1962. Kammhuber retired from his post in the same year.

==Aftermath==
Upon arrival at Tegel, the two planes were immediately hidden in [[hangar]]s and journalists were prohibited from taking pictures of them.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; For years after, it was believed that the two planes had been repainted as aircraft of the [[United States Air Force]] and returned to West Germany by USAF pilots, or that they had been disassembled and transported back to the West in pieces.&lt;ref name="Tages" /&gt; The arrival of two massive [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124]] at Tegel from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also fuelled speculations that the two F-84s would be transported back in these aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; Another theory (which turned out to be true) held that the two aircraft were hidden by the French authorities at Tegel and, later, buried at the airfield, where they were accidentally rediscovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgmannschaft.info/forum/upload/showthread.php?t=1117 Luftraumverletzungen und -zwischenfälle über dem Gebiet der DDR]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{de icon}}, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exhibition at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr|Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow]]'' in 2006, pictures of the two buried and then rediscovered Thunderstreaks at Tegel were shown, finally clearing up the question of what became of the two planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt;

The pilots of the two Thunderstreaks, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, were banned from flying and transferred to the ground crew at Lechfeld.&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The F-84F Thunderstreak, in service with the ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' since inception of the unit on 22 July 1958, was phased out of service on 13 July 1966, the ''Geschwader'' having accumulated over 80,000 flight hours with the planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKI9zAJBsmB2e5ezvqRcNGglFR9b31fj_zcVP0A_YLciHJHR0VFAN5emug!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjBfT0tD?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB060000000001%2FW27G5DLE422INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' website – History] {{de icon}} accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 incident===
[[File:Hawker Sea Hawks of the West German Marineflieger in August 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Marineflieger-Geschwader 1]]
Eleven months after the F-84 incident, the Soviet threat of to shooting down any aircraft violating the border materialized when a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', piloted by [[Kapitänleutnant]] Knut Anton Winkler, was shot at by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters when it accidentally crossed into East German airspace near [[Eisenach]]. Winkler, who had been returning from a training exercise on board {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean, had to carry out an emergency landing at [[Ahlhorn]], 45&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The aircraft was eventually written-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/veith/seahawk.htm  DDR-Luftwaffe.de – Sea Hawk] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler himself died less than four years later in a [[F-104 Starfighter]] accident on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactus-starfighter-staffel.de/public/html/in_memoriam.html In Memoriam] List of German pilots killed in F-104 Starfighter accidents, accessed: 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chronology of the universe''' describes the history and [[future of the universe]] according to [[Big Bang]] cosmology. The earliest stages of the universe's existence are estimated as taking place 13.8 [[billion years]] ago, with an [[confidence level|uncertainty]] of around 21 million years at the 68% confidence level.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;
The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck Collaboration]] in 2015 published the estimate of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago (68% confidence interval). See Table 4 on page 31 of pdf. {{Cite journal

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E.

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Ages ===

{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===
:''Around 150 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang''
{{See also|Stellar formation|Dwarf galaxy| Baryon acoustic oscillations|Observable universe#Large-scale structure|Structure formation|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Stelliferous era}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]s often showcase galaxies from an ancient era that tell us what the early Stelliferous Age was like]]
[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.
|}

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper editor Youssef Sebai and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Youssef Sebai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft (c/n 45303/141 N99862). Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025130/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]].

A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

A '''humbug''' is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a [[hoax]] or in jest.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humbug|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/humbug|publisher=Collin's Dictionary|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first described in 1751 as student [[slang]], and recorded in 1840 as a "nautical phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Years Before the Mast | author=Dana, Richard Henry Jr. | authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. | year=1840|quote=When there is danger or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work faster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing, or, as the nautical phrase is, 'humbugged,' no sloth could make less headway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also often used as an exclamation to mean [[nonsense]] or [[gibberish]].

When referring to a person, a humbug means a [[fraud]] or [[impostor]], implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], created by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. His famous reference to [[Christmas]], '''"Bah! Humbug!"''', declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and television versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees.

Another use of the word was by [[John Collins Warren]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor who worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of [[ether]] anesthesia, administered by [[William Thomas Green Morton]], a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=William |title=The Genealogy of Mass General |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/genealogy-mass-general?page=5 |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=35 |issue=6 |year=1984 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book ''The Student'' (1750–1751), ii. 41, where it is called "a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's ''The Universal Jester'', subtitled "a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs" from 1754; as mentioned in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from 1911, which further refers to the ''New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Humbug |volume=13 |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven:
* [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''hum'', meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word ''bugges'' (used in the Bible), a variant of ''bogey'', meaning 'apparitions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling'' [1891], Chapter X [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gsft/gsft12.htm of ''The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse word ''hum'' mentioned, or ''hume'', actually means 'dark air' in [[Old Norwegian]]. From the other [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] based on Old Norse, there is ''húm'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which means 'twilight', ''hómi'' in [[Faeroese language|Faeroese]] which means 'unclear', and ''humi'' in Old [[Swedish language|Swedish]] which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hum|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this word is also derived the Swedish verb ''hymla'', still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hymla|title='Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hymla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' by [[Francis Grose]], 1731–1791, ''to hum'' in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with ''bugges'' from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word ''bug'' is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Bugge'' (of which the term ''[[Bogeyman|bogey]]'' is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word ''bögge'' (of which ''böggel-mann'' (''"Goblin"'') is derived)&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle English Dictionary'' by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, University of Michigan Press, 1958, {{ISBN|978-0-472-01025-7}}, page 1212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary'', 11th edition, Merriam-Webster, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-809-5}}, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Norwegian dialect word ''bugge'' meaning "important man".&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'', Merriam-Webster, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-603-9}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh ''bwg'' (''"ghost"'') could also be connected,&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bug |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought in the past to be the origin of the English term however more recent studies indicate that it is a borrowing from the much older Middle English word.&lt;ref&gt;''Metatony in Baltic, Volume 6 of Leiden studies in Indo-European'' by Rick Derksen, Rodopi, 1996, {{ISBN|90-5183-990-1}}, {{ISBN|978-90-5183-990-6}}, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog   : English bogey from a Slavonic root?'', Brian Cooper 1, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Correspondence to Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Northern English Lexis: A Literary Corpus-Based Study'', Javier Ruano-Garcia, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3-0343-0058-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-0343-0058-2}}. pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in folk life'', John Geraint Jenkins, Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate, Ayer Publishing, 1977,{{ISBN|0-405-10102-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10102-1}}. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with ''bug'' meaning ghost or goblin, the use of the term applies in Dickens' novel about the Christmas ghosts. In ''Etym. Diet.'' of 1898, [[Walter Skeat]] also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where ''hum'' meant to murmur applause, and ''bug'' being a spectre.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* It could also come from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''uomo bugiardo'', which literally means 'lying man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/dictionary/brewers/humbug.html |title=Factmonster |publisher=Factmonster |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug').
* ''Uim-bog'' is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in [[Irish language|Irish]], worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' also suggests that it is a form of "[[Hamburg]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print.
* A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug—''i.e.'' something small and inconsequential, such as a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], that makes a lot of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/012504.html#humbug |title=word-detective |publisher=word-detective |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything.

The word has been used outside of anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horst Conrad |url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-ismen_.html |title=etymologie.info |publisher=Etymologie.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden since at least 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=humbug|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Humbug|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France since at least 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littre.org/definition/humbug |title=Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise, Littré 1872-1877 |publisher=www.littre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hungary, and in Finland.

[[Aircraft hijacking]] incidents between the United States and [[Cuba]] were at their height between 1968 and 1972. These incidents have variously been attributed to [[terrorism]], extortion, flight for political asylum, mental illness, and transportation between the two countries as a result of the ongoing antagonistic [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the Communist government restrictions against Cubans attempting to leave Cuba.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings] Study of data  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822080601/http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measures by both governments contributed to a gradual reduction of reported incidents towards the mid-1970s. Governmental measures included an amendment to [[Cuban law]] which made hijacking a crime in 1970, the introduction of metal detectors in U.S. airports in 1973, and a joint agreement between the U.S. and Cuba signed in Sweden to return or prosecute hijackers.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Below is a non-comprehensive list of hijacking incidents of aircraft between Cuba and the United States.

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Hoaxes''' is a [[website]] created by Alex Boese in 1997 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] as a resource for reporting and discussing [[hoax]]es and [[urban legends]], both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/12/19/aboese.DTL ''"The Bunk Stops Here: An interview with Alex Boese, curator of the Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 19, 2002 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, A.

In 2004, PC Magazine included the site as one of the "Top 100 Sites You Didn't Know You Couldn't Live Without,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federatedmedia.net/authors/hoaxes ''"Museum of Hoaxes" (advertiser profile)''], [[Federated Media Publishing Inc|Federated Media Publishing]], URL last accessed November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1558713,00.asp ''"The Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[PC Magazine]], April 20, 2004 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Sci Fi Weekly named it "site of the week" for the week beginning 7 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Dellamonica, A.

Boese has published two books on hoaxes: ''Museum of Hoaxes'' ([[E.P. Dutton]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-525-94678-0}}) and ''[[Hippo eats dwarf|Hippo Eats Dwarf]]: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S.'' (Harvest Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-15-603083-7}}). A third book by Boese, ''Elephants on Acid'' (Harvest Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-15-603135-6}}), focuses on unusual scientific experiments. His latest book is ''Electrified Sheep'', published by Boxtree 2011, is also about strange scientific experiments.

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

'''News''' is [[information]] about current events. This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events. It is also used as a platform to manufacture opinion for the population see [[propaganda]].

Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.

==Meaning==
===Etymology===
The [[English language|English]] word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[Wiktionary:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[Wiktionary:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[Wiktionary:nový|nový]]'', "new"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' – and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"News", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. "Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''rēs nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later {{smallcaps|novel n.}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=news|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Garretson Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at [[Barnard College]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|date=1 November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newness===
As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.&lt;ref name=Stephens13&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith7&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 7. "In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated."&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smith7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Théophraste Renaudot]]: "History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettegree3&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. "Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market – and by the sixteenth century it was a real market – was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Park675&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 675–676. "News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences."&lt;/ref&gt; News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past – or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.&lt;ref name=Park675 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, "When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff &amp; Schudson; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. "It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity===
According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. "... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. "The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. "[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media."&lt;/ref&gt; From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. "News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity."&lt;/ref&gt; A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.&lt;ref name=Globalization6&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. "News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;Phil MacGregor, "International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. "Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. […] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, naïve empiricism could not last."&lt;/ref&gt; News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. "Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often – whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder – to shock."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKH&gt;Jesper Strömbäck, Michael Karlsson, &amp; Nicolas Hopmann, "Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news". ''Journalism Studies'' 13.5–6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsworthiness===
Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists apply news values to identify a news story. News values determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by its audience or readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-10-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered "newsworthy" has met different definitions, such as the notion of [[news values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues |title=News values: immediacy and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of telecommunication}}

===Folk news===
Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. "The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing—let alone printing presses or computers—to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. […] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. "A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth—the coffeehouse—flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government proclamations===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]

Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsams.nl/ |title=United Courier Systems |publisher=Ucsams.nl |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming Emperor of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to [[Reeve (England)|sheriffs]] for public display and reading at the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], among the [[Khasi people]] in India, and in the [[Meskwaki|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] cultures of the American midwest. The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. "Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at [[mosque]]s, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early news networks===
The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. [[Mail|Postal services]] have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.&lt;ref name=Fang14&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27. "Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society—the ability to inform them of new regulations—but gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received—the power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the imperial communication channels, called the "[[Royal Road]]" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, "Royal Roads" (1995), p. 129. "The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19 – 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker13 /&gt; The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

The world's first written news may have originated in [[Spring and Autumn period|eighth century B.C.E. China]], where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to [[Confucius]], were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han dynasty]] is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC–AD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes."&lt;/ref&gt; Government-produced news sheets, called [[tipao]], circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.&lt;ref name=Smith14 /&gt; The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') to centralize news distribution for the court.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 14. "However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau – the Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') – was created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor-generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53–8)"&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters called ''ch'ao pao'' continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith14a&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960–1278), the ''ti pao'' was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367–1644) was seen by a wider circle of society."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in [[Beijing]], during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]].

Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the [[Taika Reform]] and again during the [[Kamakura period]] from 1183–1333. The system depended on ''hikyaku'', runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), pp. 45–46 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Gordenker, "Postal Symbol"; ''Japan Times'', 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.&lt;ref name=Smith14&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The postal system established during the [[Edo period]] was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150&amp;nbsp;km/day and express speed of 200&amp;nbsp;km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own ''[[Kabunakama|nakama]]'' (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the [[Hanseatic League]] from Bruges to Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to-date news.&lt;ref name=Pettegree3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCusker &amp; Gravesteijn, ''Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism'' (1991), p. 21. "Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''Notizie scritte'', which cost one [[gazette|gazetta]].&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html Wan-Press.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html |date=2012-01-11 }}, A Newspaper Timeline, [[World Association of Newspapers]]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of [[newspapers]] though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avvisi'' were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century ''avvisi'' long passages from were finding their way into published monthlies such as the [[Mercure de France]] and, in northern Italy, ''Pallade veneta''.&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Pallade Veneta: Writings on Music and Society, 1650–1750''. Venice: Fondazione Ugo e Olga Levi, 1985. Chs. 1 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Song and Season: Science, Culture, and Theatrical Time''. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2007.

[[File:Postkurse 1563.jpg|thumb|Some European postal routes in 1563]]
Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian I]] in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janettto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]]. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This system became the [[Reichspost|Imperial Reichspost]], administered by Tasso descendents (subsequently known as [[Lamoral II Claudius Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt; The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] and [[General Post Office|English postal service]] also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und-Taxis.&lt;ref name=Bakker13&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 18–19. "Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin."&lt;/ref&gt; The German lawyer [[Christoph von Scheurl]] and the [[Fugger]] house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network.&lt;ref name=Bakker11 /&gt; Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 35–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.&lt;ref name=Bakker10&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments.&lt;ref name=Bakker10 /&gt; Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 21. "Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability.&lt;/ref&gt; Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Bakker11&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the newspaper===

The [[History of paper|spread of paper]] and the [[History of printing|printing press]] from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 6–8. "So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of the oldest newspapers|first newspapers]] emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien]], from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';&lt;ref name="Relation"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}; World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman [[acta diurna]] served a similar purpose circa 131 BC.

The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 9. "The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative – or even whether what was reported would turn out to be important."&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned "seditious opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Act]], publication was restricted to approved presses—as exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: "Published By Authority".&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tory]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (During this era, the [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act]] limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders—especially from the [[Dutch Republic]], where publishers could evade state censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 [[Postal Service Act]], and continuing into the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 90. "The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the [[American frontier|West]], fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 8–9, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 31, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boosterism|Boosters]] of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830s American, wrote [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], was "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 48. [''"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le résultat de dix-huit siècles de travaux et d'expérience. Il porte le vêtement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le passé, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le présent; c'est un homme très civilisé, qui, pour un temps, se soumet à vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les déserts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux."'']&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the ''Bureau d'Esprit''.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of [[statistics]], especially [[economic statistics]] which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the [[stock market]]s. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as [[Keynesianism]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was ''The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser'', established in 1801, and followed by ''The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer'' in 1822 and the ''Liberia Herald'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.&lt;ref name=Fosu60&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; The first newspaper published in a native African language was the ''Muigwithania'', published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; ''Muigwithania'' and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period—as well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were slow to [[Arab culture|spread to the Arab world]], which had a stronger tradition of [[Communication#Verbal|oral communication]], and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called ''jurnals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newswire===
The development of the [[electrical telegraph]], which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Days before Morse's Baltimore–Washington line transmitted the famous question, "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.)&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"/&gt; Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of [[wire services]] concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with [[Charles-Louis Havas]], who founded Bureau Havas (later [[Agence France-Presse]]) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Havas's protoges, [[Bernhard Wolff]], founded [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in Berlin in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Havas disciple, [[Paul Reuter]], began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the [[Reuters]] news agency—specializing in news from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central Press]] agency, later called the [[Press Association]], to handle domestic news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto "Follow the Cable", setting up news outposts across the [[British Empire]] in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the [[Western Union]] company.&lt;ref name=Starr177 /&gt;

The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]], reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|an undersea telegraph cable]] successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headrick | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Griset | first2 = Pascal | year = | title = Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838–1939 | url = | journal = Business History Review | volume = 75 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Meikle, ''Interpreting News''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p.

The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), p. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 153–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eisenbahnen- und Telegraphendichte der Erde um 1900.jpg|thumb|World railway and telegraph system, 1900]]
By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 26–27. "The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. […] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news […] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services."&lt;/ref&gt; Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into "soft" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and "human interest".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with ''Vestnik'', the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Russian Revolution]], the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]].&lt;ref name=Palmer184&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the ''Red China'' newspaper and the internal ''Reference News''. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency ''[[Xinhua]]'', New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=XinXin&gt;Xin Xin, "A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers"; ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 28.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

These agencies touted their ability to distill events into "minute globules of news", 20–30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments.&lt;ref name=Palmer184 /&gt; Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The wire services brought forth the "inverted pyramid" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details included as it goes along.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"/&gt; The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 20 September 1918 ''Pravda'' editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in "telegraph style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 25–26. Translating Lenin: "Why instead of 200–400 lines you can't write in 20–10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo-Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.&lt;ref name=OBB23&gt;Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 23–24. "Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests."&lt;/ref&gt; The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and [[economic globalization]]. "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
The [[British Broadcasting Company]] began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.&lt;ref name=Allen26&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 31. "It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it."&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).&lt;ref name=Allen26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press–Radio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Britain, American news radio avoided "controversial" topics as per norms established by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref name=Allen34&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by ''Fortune'' considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source.&lt;ref name=Allen34 /&gt; Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 27. "Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The [[Nazi Party]] made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. set up its [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was [[Germany Calling|seized by Germany]], and then [[Radio 1212|by the United States]]—which created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the "[[The Zero Hour (World War II)|Zero Hour]]" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 39, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide [[Voice of America]] programs, produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 108–114, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward R. Murrow]], who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 179, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Turner]]'s creation of the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, [[BBC World Service Television]]. Rupert Murdoch's Australian [[News Corporation]] entered the picture with [[Fox News Channel]] in the US, [[Sky News]] in Britain, and [[STAR TV]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=McNair108 /&gt; Combining this new appartus with the use of [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], the United States waged the 1991–1992 [[Gulf War]] with the assistance of nonstop [[Media coverage of the Gulf War|media coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's specialty is the [[crisis]], to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 45–48. "When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world."&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news was transmitted via [[INTELSAT]] communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN, said an executive, would bring a "town crier to the global village".&lt;ref name=Tomlinson /&gt;

In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab &amp; Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by [[BBC Arabic Television]], which closed in April 1996. It used [[Arabsat]] to broadcast.&lt;ref name=McNair108&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The early internet, known as [[ARPANET]], was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the [[Netscape]] browser in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[online newspaper]] was the ''Electronic Telegraph'', published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Richmond, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news]"; ''The Telegraph'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.&lt;ref name=Allan175&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the release of web browser Netscape made news sites accessible to more people.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt; On the day of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The ''Oklahoma City Daily'' posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and ''Time'' magazine, posted photographs of the scene.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt;

Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause [[information overload]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] called this period the "technetronic era", in which "global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him."&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the [[citizen journalist]], who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events.

==News media today==

News can travel through different [[Media (communication)|communication media]].&lt;ref name=Globalization6 /&gt; In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a [[reporter]], where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or [[editing|edited]] and manually [[typesetting|set in type]] along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "[[breaking news]]" has become trite as [[commercial broadcasting]] [[United States cable news]] services that are available 24 hours a day use live [[communications satellite]] technology to bring current events into [[consumer]]s' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via [[radio]], [[television]], [[mobile phone]], and the [[internet]].

Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 42–43. "In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper===
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news.]]
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies—i.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of [[consolidation of media ownership|consolidation in media ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt;

The world's top three [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|most circulated newspapers]] all publish from Japan.

About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented [[paywall]]s for their websites.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5–20 years.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Shelley Thompson, "The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's [[Público (Spain)|Público]] has [https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-spains-p%C3%BAblico-redefined-its-strategy-and-grew-its-audience-40-percent reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %].

===Television===
Internationally distributed news channels include [[BBC News]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Sky News]]. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya—especially rural areas without much electricity—televisions are rare.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42 /&gt;

The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is [[Associated Press Television News]]. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]]—itself a sizeable video news exchange.&lt;ref name=Hachten39&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN International]] is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN /&gt;

===Internet===
[[Online journalism]] is news that is reported on the [[internet]]. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: "It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting – you can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Einar Thorsen, "Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Patrick &amp; Stuart Allan, "'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Schudson]], professor at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], has said that "[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age."&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK3tgAEACAAJ|isbn=0393912876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of "news" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; "the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying".&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"/&gt;

Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:

* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.
* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.
* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of "pro-am" relationships has emerged.
* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.
* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.
* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. "The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future.

Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on social media platforms]. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/growth-in-mobile-news-use-driven-by-older-adults/ study by Pew Research], a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices.

Because internet does not have the "column inches" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the [[world wide web]] also enables [[hyperlinking]], which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paterson2006&gt;Chris Paterson, "News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet", ''Papers in International and Global Communication'' 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists.&lt;ref name=SKH /&gt;

==News agencies==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumb|Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988]]
News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Jane | last2 = Forde | first2 = Susan | title = "The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century News"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[news agency]] still operating is the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W.

By the end of the twentieth century, [[Reuters]] far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;

[[United Press International]] gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]].

News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important [[Bloomberg News]], convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.&lt;ref name=OBB21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewha&gt;John Bartram Ewha, "News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg"; ''Journalism Studies'' 4.3 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ewha /&gt;

Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, [[Xinhua]] has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government-subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt; It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Junhao | title = "From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978"; | url = | journal = Political Communication | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agencies with considerable reach include [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (Germany), [[Kyodo News]] (Japan), the ''[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]'' (Italy), the [[Middle East News Agency]] (Egypt), [[Tanjug]] (Serbia), [[EFE]] (Spain), and [[Anadolu Agency]] (Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, [[news aggregators]] play a role similar to that of the news agency—and, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by [[Yahoo! News]] in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. [[Google News]] relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt; In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M.

==Global news system==
In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the "Big Four" news agencies—Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International—representing the [[Western bloc]], and the Communist agencies: [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] from the Soviet Union, and [[Xinhua]] from China.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Kohei | title = The western perspective in Yahoo! News and Google News: Quantitative analysis of geographic coverage of online news | url = | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 75 | issue = 2| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television news agencies include [[Associated Press Television News]], which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.&lt;ref name=OBB21&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 21. "Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP&gt; It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;

By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of [[History of the world|world history]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 7. "Since World War II, an intricate an worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication—speech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)—into a fifth era of long-distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World Information and Communication Order===
The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the [[Holocaust]] and [[World War Two]] which are considered foundational in the West.&lt;ref name=Zeiler31&gt;Barbie Zeiler, "Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form "development journalism", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic—the first major news item regarding that country in years—the resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] predominates in global news exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Tomlinson&gt;John Tomlinson, "Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) has promoted a [[New World Information and Communication Order]], which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 8. "The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news."&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the 1980 [[MacBride report]], "Many Voices, One World", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the [[Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter Press Service]], founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, [[economic development]], [[economic integration]], natural resources, population, health, education, and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=Giffard194&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Giffard194 /&gt; IPS receives grants from organizations such as the [[United Nations Development Program]] and other United Nations agencies, [[Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz]], the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975–1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]], with assistance from the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], and [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further transformation in global news flow===
By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58–72, 133–136. "In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. […] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment – whether the state is responsive to democratic public interest – and its relative power vis-à-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi, "Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]], a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in [[information society]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==News values==
{{Journalism sidebar}}

[[News values]] are the professional norms of [[journalism]]. Commonly, news content should contain the "[[Five Ws]]" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. There should be no questions remaining. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning. Busy readers can read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.

Journalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal point of view. The result is a laying out of facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, and standing back to "let the reader decide" which view is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of "impartiality" on news broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Sue Wallace, "Impartiality in the News", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.

Mid-twentieth-century news reporting in the United States focused on political and local issues with important socio-economic impacts, such as the landing of a living person on the moon or the cold war. The focus similarly remains on political and local issues; the news [[mass media]] now comes under criticism for over-emphasis on "non-news" and "gossip" such as celebrities' personal social issues, local issues of little merit, as well as biased sensationalism of political topics such as terrorism and the economy. The dominance of celebrity and social news, the blurring of the boundary between news and reality shows and other popular culture, and the advent of citizen journalism may suggest that the nature of 'news' and news values are evolving and that traditional models of the news process are now only partially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues] News Values. URL Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsworthiness does not only depend on the topic, but also the presentation of the topic and the selection of information from that topic.

Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = "The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880–1930"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = | year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 15, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1-4165-4861-4|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Shipley Hiles &amp; Amanda Hinnart, "Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: "Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words."&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: "The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. […] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality' – the need to hear the widest range of views – all sides of the story."&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;

==Social organization of news production==
===News organizations===
Viewed from a [[sociology of knowledge|sociological perspective]], news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchically structured organizations. Reporters, making up a larger group near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports. Occasionally, decision-makers higher in the structure may intervene.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C. H. Berger &amp; S. H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship. Therefore, news organizations have covert but unshakeable policies about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job. Journalists never receive the policy in writing; they simply learn how things are done.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 139–140, 146–152. "One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient […] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism "''makes the use of discretion predictable.'' It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original)."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, up to and including [[journalism school]].&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use well-understood formats and subgenres which vary by topic. "Rituals of objectivity", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items, which revolve around press conferences or other scheduled events, are predictable in advance. Further predictability is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C. H. Berger &amp; S. H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of [[Gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeepers]] in the flow of information. In other words, to ask why and how certain representations of reality make their way from news producers to news consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Shoemaker, "A New Gatekeeping Model", from ''Gatekeeping'' (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 57. "Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day."&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may obtain in this case also due to the role of a few extremely well-connected nodes in the social network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Erneste, "Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is "click-thinking", the editorial selection of news stories—and of journalists—who can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has differentiated pages and intensive data collection, enabling rapid feedback about which stories are popular and who reads them.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Nguyen, "Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Redden, "[http://research.gold.ac.uk/6540/ The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics]"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists' sometimes unattributed 'cannibalization' of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt; The digital age can accelerate the problem of [[circular reporting]]: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timmer, "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research/ Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up …]"; ''Ars Technica'', 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have found '[[Old boy network|old boys' networks]]' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to "hard" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to "soft", "humanised" topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with institutions===
For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.&lt;ref name=Fang14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmon90&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions.&lt;ref name=Salmon90 /&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] wire service developed a "bilateral monopoly" with the [[Western Union]] telegraph company.&lt;ref name=Starr177&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annteresa Lubrano, ''The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change''; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IVWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree.&lt;ref name=OBB23 /&gt; News for consumption has operated under [[Statism|statist]] assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5. "Free of an extended view of the history of press-government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, "The Sociology of News Production", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 14. "One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level—the story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 62–63. "To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted."&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C. H. Berger &amp; S. H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 34–37. "In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Leuven | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Joye | first2 = Stijn | title = "Civil Society Organizations at the Gates? A Gatekeeping Study of News Making Efforts by NGOs and Government Institutions"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Press/Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State control===
{{Main|State media}}

Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct [[political warfare]], alternatively known as [[public diplomacy]] and, in the modern era, [[international broadcasting]]. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 4–6, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; American propaganda broadcasters include [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], [[Crusade for Freedom|set up during the Cold War]] and still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 [[Radio Moscow|by the Soviet Union]]. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 129–133, 132, 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the [[BBC World Service]] are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 21, 55. "The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy."&lt;/ref&gt; Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the [[International Organization of Journalists]]. The Russian [[KGB]] heavily pursued a strategy of [[disinformation]], planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasts into Iraq before the [[Gulf War|Second Gulf War]] mimicked the style of local programming.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see&lt;/ref&gt; The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station [[Alhurra]] and radio station [[Radio Sawa]] to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/10/news/war-iraqmedia10 Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq]"; ''Los Angeles Times'', 10 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Al Jazeera]], a TV and internet news network owned by the government of [[Qatar]], has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; State-owned [[China Central Television]] operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[Press TV]] and Russia's [[Russia Today]], branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences.

As distinct from [[advertising]], which deals with marketing distinct from news, [[public relations]] involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the "third-party technique", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as [[Video News Release]]s, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle [[product placement]] and other techniques to influence viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;Jamie Matthews, "Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This pre-organized news content has been called an [[information subsidy]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtin | first1 = Patricia A. | title = Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Public Relations Research | volume = 11 | issue = 1| year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests—but the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen /&gt;

Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the [[Nayirah (testimony)|1990 news story]] about Iraqi soldiers taking "babies out of incubators" in Kuwaiti hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rothmyer, "What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation." ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 9.3, Fall 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen&gt;Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, &amp; David McQueen, "News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==News consumption==
Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.&lt;ref name=Stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 1–2, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), pp. 93–94. "Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. […] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. […] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture—as exemplified by James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which derives from the newspapers of June 16 (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brandon Kershner, ''The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yc7HAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79 Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue]". Also see: James Broderick, "'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 study by sociologist [[Bernard Berelson]] found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as "lost", "nervous", "isolated", and "suffering" due to the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berelson, "[http://simson.net/ref/1948/What_missing_the_newspaper_means.pdf What 'missing the newspaper' means]", in ''Communications Research 1948–1949'', ed. Lazarsfeld &amp; Stanton; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.&lt;ref name="Allen47"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories—and get their "real news" from television.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and cultural cohesion===
An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.&lt;ref name=Starr24&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. "Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it."&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. "The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group."&lt;/ref&gt; News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, "Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 156–160. "In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent – Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968 -gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;&lt;ref name=Zeiler31 /&gt; etc.

With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6–7. "But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. […] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people."&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28–31. "A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence—regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sphere===
This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=Starr24 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.&lt;ref name="Allen47"/&gt;

This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179–185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News events===
As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 685–686. "In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events—at least as listener if not as spectator—as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = "The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to "rally" behind its current leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a "crisis", and influenced a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.&lt;ref&gt;Danie Du Plessis, "What's News in South Africa?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. "Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, "What's News in the United States?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families—such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, "What's News in Jordan?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 233–234. Also see: Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past"; ''Memory Studies'' 7.4, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News making===
News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University - Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"/&gt; The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.

Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.

News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.

===Psychological effects===

Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Schuster, et al., "A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terr | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Rees, "The Trauma Factor", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. "Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.&lt;/ref&gt;

News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. "When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues."&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''The Markup''''' is an American [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[New York City]] that will focus on [[Data-driven journalism|data driven journalism]] covering the ethics and impact of technology on society. Markup was co-founded by two former [[ProPublica]] journalists [[Julia Angwin]] and [[Jeff Larson (journalist)|Jeff Larson]]. The idea was conceived in April 2018, and expects to launch in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/former-propublica-journalists-are-launching-a-newsroom-to-cover-the-impact-of-technology-on-society/|title=Former ProPublica journalists are launching a newsroom to cover the impact of technology on society|last=Owen|first=Laura H.|date=2018-04-12|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data journalism ==
According to Julia Angwin, The Markup plans to collect and create public data sets through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|public records]] requests, automated data collection, crowdsourcing of information and creation of tools, for example at ProPublica they built a browser extension to analyze [[Facebook]] ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2018/9/27/17908798/julia-angwin-markup-jeff-larson-craig-newmark-data-investigative-journalism-peter-kafka-podcast|title=It may be ‘data journalism,’ but Julia Angwin’s new site the Markup is nothing like FiveThirtyEight|work=Recode|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The Markup received $20 million gift from [[Craigslist]] founder [[Craig Newmark]]. They also raised $2 million from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] and an additional $1 million from [[Ford Foundation]], [[MacArthur Foundation]] and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
