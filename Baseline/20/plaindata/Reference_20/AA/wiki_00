They were invented by Lee Sallows, who also coined the word \"autogram\". An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as “one”, “two”, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called ‘self-enumerating’ or ‘self-documenting’ sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:\n\nThe first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in Douglas Hofstadter's \"Metamagical Themas\" column in \"Scientific American\".\n\nThe task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.\n\nA type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic pangram, a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once. Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by Rudy Kousbroek. Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating ‘translation’ of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine. Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:\n\nSallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won't be exact integers. He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:\n\nAutograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:\n\nJust as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:\nA special kind of autogram is the ‘reflexicon’ (short for “reflexive lexicon”), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies. The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as “contains”, “comprises”, “employs”, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.\n\nFor example, “Sixteen e's, six f's, one g, three h's, nine i's, nine n's, five o's, five r's, sixteen s's, five t's, three u's, four v's, one w, four x's” is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls “dummy text” in the shape of “one g” and “one w”. The latter might equally be replaced with “one #”, where “#” can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist but three and only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.\n\n"}

{"id": "11797804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11797804", "title": "Comparison (grammar)", "text": "Comparison (grammar)\n\nComparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages, whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The comparative expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the superlative is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.\n\nThe grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the \"positive\", which simply denotes a property (as with the English words \"big\" and \"fully\"); the \"comparative\", which indicates \"greater degree (as \"bigger\" and \"more fully\"); and the \"superlative\", which indicates \"greatest degree (as \"biggest\" and \"most fully\"). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. \"beautiful\", \"less beautiful\", \"least beautiful\".\n\nThe comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the \"-er\" suffix or modifying word \"more\" or \"less\" (e.g., \"faster\", \"more intelligent\", \"less wasteful\"); it can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., \"more men than women\"). One preposition, \"near\", also has a superlative form, as in \"Find the restaurant nearest your house\".\n\nComparatives and superlatives may be formed morphologically, by inflection, as with the English and German \"-er\" and \"-(e)st\" forms, or syntactically, as with the English \"more...\" and \"most...\" and the French \"plus...\" and \"le plus...\" forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as \"better\" and \"best\" (from \"good\") and \"less\" and \"least\" (from \"little/few\") in English, and \"meilleur\" (from \"bon\") and \"mieux\" (from the adverb \"bien\") in French.\n\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n\nComparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with \"than\" in English, \"als\" in German, etc. In Russian and Greek (Ancient, Koine and Modern) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in \"the best swimmer out of all the girls\".\n\nLanguages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include \"as... as\" and \"less/least...\".\n\nА few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is Bulgarian, where expressions like \"по̀ човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)\" (literally \"more person\", \"most person\", \"less person\" but normally \"better kind of a person\", \"best kind of person\", \"not that good kind of a person\") and \"по̀ обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)\" (\"I like more\", \"I like the least\") are quite usual.\n\nIn many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, \"May the better man win\" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form \"May the best man win\" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.\n\nIn some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes considered ungrammatical.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnglish has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs \"more\" and \"most\".\n\nAs a general rule, words with one syllable require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require \"more\" or \"most\", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, \"e.g.\" 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.\n\nMorphological comparison uses the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"). These inflections are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -\"ior\" and -\"issimus\" and Ancient Greek -\"īōn\" and -\"istos\". They are typically added to shorter words, words of Anglo-Saxon origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these inflections have fewer than three syllables.\n\nThis system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like \"good\", \"better\", and \"best\", contain suppletive forms. These irregular forms include:\n\nThe second system of comparison in English appends the grammatical particles \"more\" and \"most\", themselves the irregular comparatives of \"many\" and \"much\", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the diminutives \"less\" and \"least\".\n\nThis system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than \"-ly\" (e.g., \"beautiful\"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:\n\nSome adjectives, the absolute or ungradable adjectives do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either \"present\" or \"absent\", such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything \"very Cretaceous\", or to characterize something as \"more igneous\" than something else.\n\nSome grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as \"full\", \"complete\", \"unique\", or \"empty\", which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute. However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nMany prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as \"more perfect\", \"most unique\", and \"most parallel\" as illogical pleonasms: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be \"very unique\", or \"more unique\" than something else.\n\nOther style guides argue that terms like \"perfect\" and \"parallel\" never apply \"exactly\" to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean \"nearly perfect\", \"nearly parallel\", and so on; in this sense, \"more perfect\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and \"more parallel\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.\n\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.\n\nIn Bulgarian, comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics \"по-\" (\"more\") and \"най-\" (\"most\"):\n\nIn Czech, Polish, Slovak and Slovene, comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).\n\nIn Russian, comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:\n\nIn contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. \"the most beautiful\") and absolute (e.g. \"very beautiful\").\n\nFrench: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (\"mon\", \"ton\", \"son\", etc.), before \"plus\" or \"moins\" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: \"Elle est la plus belle femme\" → (she is the most beautiful woman); \"Cette ville est la moins chère de France\" → (this town is the least expensive in France); \"C'est sa plus belle robe\" → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix \"-issime\" but only with certain words, for example: \"C'est un homme richissime\" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.\n\nPortuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative \"(superlativo relativo)\" and absolute superlative \"(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).\nFor the comparative superlative they use the words \"mais\" and \"più\" between the article and the adjective, like \"most\" in English.\nFor the absolute superlative they either use \"muito\"/\"molto\" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding \"issimo\" (singular masculine), \"issima\" (singular feminine), \"íssimos\"/\"issimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íssimas\"/\"issime\" (plural feminine). For example:\nThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in \"-re\" and \"-le\" (deriving from Latin words ending in \"-er\" and \"-ilis\") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending \"-re\" and they gain the endings \"errimo\" (singular masculine), \"errima\" (singular feminine), \"érrimos\"/\"errimi\" (plural masculine), or \"érrimas\"/\"errime\" (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the \"-l\"/\"-le\" ending and gain \"ílimo\"/\"illimo\" (singular masculine), \"ílima\"/\"illima\" (singular feminine), \"ílimos\"/\"illimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íli\nRomanian, similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word \"mai\" before the adjective, which operates like \"more\" or \"-er\" in English. For example: \"luminos\" → bright, \"mai luminos\" → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word \"puțin\" (little) is added between \"mai\" and the adjective, for example \"mai puțin luminos\" → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant \"cel\" precedes \"mai,\" conjugated as \"cel / cei\" for male singular / plural and \"cea / cele\" for female singular / plural. For example: \"cea mai luminoasă stea\" → the brightest star; \"cele mai frumoase fete\" → the most beautiful girls; \"cel mai mic morcov\" → the smallest carrot.\n\nScottish Gaelic: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an \"e\" to the end and \"i\" before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by \"nas\" to say \"more,\" and \"as\" to say \"most.\" (The word \"na\" is used to mean \"than\".) Adjectives that begin with \"f\" are lenited. and \"as\" use different syntax constructions. For example:\nTha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.\" → I am taller than my sisters.\nIs mi as àirde.\" → I am the tallest.\n\nAs in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.\n\nIn other tenses, \"nas\" is replaced by \"na bu\" and \"as\" by \"a bu,\" both of which lenite the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an \"f\" followed by a vowel, the word \"bu\" is reduced to \"b\"'. For example:\n\n\nWelsh is similar to English in many respects. The ending \"-af\" is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English \"-est\", and with (most) long words \"mwyaf\" precedes it, as in the English \"most\". Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular. Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative \"must\" be used, e.g. of two people - \"John ydy'r talaf\" (John is the tallest).\n\nIn Akkadian cuneiform, (on a 12 paragraph clay tablet), from the time period of the 1350 BC Amarna letters (a roughly 20-year body of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral \"10,\" as well as \"7 and 7.\" The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.\n\nThe term \"7 and 7\" means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds \"more\" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, \"Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):\" \"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times\" more, \"...\". The word 'more' is Akkadian \"mila\", and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is \"...over and over again, overflowing,\" (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).\n\nThe numeral 10 is used for \"ten times greater\" in EA 19, \"Love and Gold\", one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-(Amenhotep IV-\"Akhenaton\"). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):\n\nThe actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, \"to light up, to rise\"), uses: -e-le-né-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: \"...may it be, flourish-our (relations).\"\n\nIn Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with \"kõige\" followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of \"sinine\" 'blue' is \"sinisem\" and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is \"kõige sinisem\". There is also a synthetic (\"short\") superlative form, which is formed by adding \"-m\" to the end of the plural partitive case. For \"sinine\" the plural partitive form is \"siniseid\" and so \"siniseim\" is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the \"kõige\"-form, has a lot of exceptions.\n\n"}

The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of intellectual property, providing employment and entertainment for billions of people around the world.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was introduced as in 1966 that lasted three years. \"\" commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes. With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, \"Star Trek\" grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Wars\" was introduced as a feature film, \"A New Hope\" (1977). A novelization titled \"\", based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, \"Star Wars\" quickly grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Trek\" debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western \"Wagon Train\" and the adventure stories of Horatio Hornblower, but evolved into an idealistic, utopian prospect of future human society. Inspired by \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Star Trek\"s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. \"Star Trek\" occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional time travel and interdimensional travel. The Earth of the \"Star Trek\" universe shares most of its history with the real world.\n\n\"Star Wars\" debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. \"Star Wars\" mainly belongs to the space opera subgenre of science fiction that follows The Hero's Journey and was inspired by works such as Beowulf, King Arthur and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history. It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. \"Star Wars\" is set \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\", although many characters are human, occasionally use Earth metaphors and exhibit human character traits.\n\nAlthough both \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. \"Star Wars\" has not produced any live-action television series while \"Star Trek\" has produced seven live-action television series.\n\n\"Star Trek\" likewise has not produced any television films; whereas \"Star Wars\" has produced at least three live-action television films outside the \"Star Wars\" film saga. The \"Star Wars Holiday Special\", \"\" and \"\" are all live-action television spin-off films set in the \"Star Wars\" universe, but not considered part of the official \"Star Wars canon\".\n\n\nAside from both having the word \"star\" in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the space western subgenre.\n\nBoth stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in \"Star Trek\" consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the United Federation of Planets. \"Star Wars\" depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the Old Republic, inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the Galactic Empire and was again later reformed into a new society called the New Republic after a series of wars.\n\nBoth franchises promote philosophical and political messages.\n\nThe primary philosophies of \"Star Trek\" convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by morality tales such as \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nThe primary philosophical messages of \"Star Wars\" are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another. \"Star Wars\" preaches against totalitarian systems and favors societies that offer equality. In an interview on the \"Star Wars\" 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Patrick Stewart stated \"A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of \"Star Wars\" is a very very positive one.\"\n\nThere have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as \"The Outer Limits\" and \"Seaquest\".\n\nBoth franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including Greco-Roman mythology. Many planets and alien species in \"Star Trek\", for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various \"Star Trek\" television series, such as \"Who Mourns for Adonais\", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings. The series also make references to Ancient Babylon and its mythic folklore. The Klingons and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century Mongols.\n\nMuch of \"Star Wars\" story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including classical Greece and Rome, such as the fall of the Old Republic in \"Star Wars\", followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire, which parallels the fall of the ancient Roman Republic followed by the rise of the Roman Empire.\n\nA 1983 documentary on the making of \"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.\n\nJ. J. Abrams, director and producer of \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and producer of \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016), directed and produced \"\" (2015). \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as Simon Pegg starred in both series.\n\n\"\" (2002) was poorly received and \"\" (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.\n\nThe newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the United Arab Emirates. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, while scenes for cities in the film \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nThe two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include canonical and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.\n\nDespite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the \"Star Wars\" film series exceed the profit of the \"Star Trek\" film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.\n\nScience fiction writer David Brin criticized \"Star Wars\" at the time of the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", arguing that while the \"Star Wars\" movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with \"Star Wars\" and George Lucas, whom he accused of \"having an agenda\", is that the \"Star Wars\" galaxy is too \"elitist\", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the Galactic Civil War as part of the \"same genetically superior royal family\". He finds the \"Star Wars\" universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that Luke Skywalker killing Palpatine would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.\n\nAmong the many other flaws he sees with \"Star Wars\" is that Anakin Skywalker becomes a hero in the ending of \"Return of the Jedi\" simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, \"Star Trek\" is \"democratic\" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.\n\nWilliam Shatner argues that \"Star Trek\" is superior to \"Star Wars\". According to him, \"\"Star Trek\" had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions.\" Shatner believes that \"Star Wars\" was only better than \"Star Trek\" in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, \"Star Trek\" was able to \"supersede \"Star Wars\" on every level\".\n\nTim Russ, who played Tuvok on \"\", claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that \"Star Trek\" reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. \"Star Wars\" in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the Eastern philosophy of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, \"Star Trek\" comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in \"our\" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas \"Star Wars\" takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.\n\nJeremy Bulloch is best known for his role as Boba Fett in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. He is a huge fan of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". He argued that while both franchises are popular, \"Star Wars\" comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.\n\nContrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of \"The New York Times\" argued, \"\"Trek\" fandom revolves around technology because the \"Star Trek\" universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and \"Gong Show\"-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in \"Star Wars\" is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because \"Star Wars\" isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.\"\n\nJohn Wenzel of \"The Denver Post\" highlighted two differences in approach, noting the \"swashbuckling\" and \"gunslinger\" style of \"Star Wars\" compared with \"Star Trek\"s \"broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity\" and that the spiritual aspect of \"Star Wars\" contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in \"Star Trek\".\n\nBillionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd \"I'm a capitalist. \"Star Wars\" is the capitalist show. \"Star Trek\" is the communist one\". He further stated \"There is no money in \"Star Trek\" because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of \"Star Wars\" starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in \"Star Wars\" is driven by money.\"\n\nArchived footage in \"Trek Nation\" showed Gene Roddenberry saying, \"I like \"Star Wars\".

There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun.\"\n\nThe two franchises have a \"symbiotic relationship\" stated Shatner, who credits \"Star Wars\" for launching the \"Star Trek\" films. He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 \"Star Trek\" fan convention in Las Vegas by stating \"\"Star Wars\" created \"Star Trek\"\". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film (\"A New Hope\"), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A \"Star Trek\" relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to \"Star Trek\". \"It was \"Star Wars\" that thrust \"Star Trek\" into the people of Paramount's consciousness\" Shatner stated.\n\nThe documentary \"Trek Nation\" features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that \"Star Trek\" was an influence while writing the original screenplay for \"Star Wars\". He explained that while both franchises were so \"far out\", \"Star Trek\" produced a fanbase that \"softened up the entertainment arena\" so that \"Star Wars\" could \"come along and stand on its shoulders.\" This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call \"Star Wars\" a \"derivative\" of \"Star Trek\".\n\nA few references to \"Star Wars\" have been inserted into \"Star Trek\" films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from \"Star Wars\" in both \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). Some \"Star Trek\" films and television episodes used the \"Star Wars\" animation shop, Industrial Light & Magic, for their special effects.\n\nWhen Roddenberry was honored at a \"Star Trek\" convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as Darth Vader. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of \"Star Wars\" and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.\n\nWilliam Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.\n\nAt a live concert, Shatner dressed as an imperial stormtrooper singing \"Girl Crush\" alongside Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.\n\nIn 2011, Shatner and Carrie Fisher posted a series of humorous YouTube videos satirizing each other's franchises.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that Captain Kirk and Princess Leia eloping and running off into the sunset would be the \"perfect union\" between \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\".\n\nShatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his Twitter account mocking \"Star Wars\".

But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.\n\nThe outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.\n\nHistorically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed, including:\n\nSullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive. he states \"Man is a poor beast of burden, as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.\"\n\nScott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective (\"The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition\" – Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole (\"The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object\" – Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to Cherry-Garrard.\n\nAmundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909. Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under Kristian Prestrud who conducted an expedition to King Edward VII Land while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.\n\nAmundsen camped on the Ross Ice Shelf at the Bay of Whales which is 60 miles (96 km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350 miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.\nScott's base was at Cape Evans on Ross Island, with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.\nConsequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.\n\nThe major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport —dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three \"motor sledges\". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander Reginald William Skelton who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant E.R.G.R. \"Teddy\" Evans as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition. Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost. One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.\n\nScott had used dogs on his first (Discovery) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.\n\nScott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his Nimrod expedition that got to within of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the Beardmore Glacier (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of William Speirs Bruce in his Arctic, Antarctic, and Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, Amundsen in the \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition, Fridtjof Nansen's crossing of Greenland, Robert Peary's three attempts at the North Pole, Eivind Astrup's work supporting Peary, Frederick Cook's discredited North Pole expedition, and Otto Sverdrup's explorations of Ellesmere Island. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take \"dogs, dogs and more dogs\".\n\nAt the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport. Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives. He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.' On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'. But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed \"reluctance\" to use dogs in this way: \"One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions.\"\n\nAmundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach. Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves. He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse. Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they \"also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal\". The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.\n\nAmundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the Inuit while on his \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.\n\nWhat Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.\n\nScott took the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18 km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.\n\nScott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that \"Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event\".\n\nAmundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, Olav Bjaaland, as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the South Pole.\n\nScott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were short of One-Ton Depot, which was from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team. Scott also blamed \"a prolonged blizzard\". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a \"normal\" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.\n\nDuring depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn. In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.\n\nScott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.)\n\nApsley Cherry-Garrard in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.\n\nScott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., Wilson's trip with Cherry-Garrard and Bowers to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.\n\nSince the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of scurvy.\n\nScott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.\n\nDehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.\n\nIt has been said (by the present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.\n\nAmundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.\n\nScott's team suffered regularly from snow blindness and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the \"day\" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the \"night\" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.\n\nIn 1921, 'Teddy' Evans wrote in his book \"South with Scott\" that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.\n\nHe did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.\n\nHe continued his instructions in the next paragraph \"You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised.\" with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.\n\nExpedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book \"The Worst Journey in the World\". However, in the 1948 preface to his book, he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and Edward Atkinson reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January. Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote \"In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\".\n\nOn 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some to the south, and in urgent need of rescue. Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.\n\nAtkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to \"use his judgement\" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.\n\nOn the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes \"We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.\" By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: \"The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble.\"\n\nAround 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing \"We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.\" (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.)\n\n"}

In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of \"difference\" versus \"equality\" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.\n\nDifference feminism did not require a commitment to essentialism. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise \"essential\" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called \"ways of knowing\"), or personality traits. These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued \"feminine\" characteristics.\n\nSome strains of difference feminism, for example Mary Daly's, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's. This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.\n\nDifference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as \"equality feminism\"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally. Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women \"whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men\".\n\nDifference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer Elise Oelsner, which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see ethics of care]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase \"difference feminism\" in a way that asks \"what difference does feminism make?\" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than \"what differences are there between men and women\"?\n\nSome have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist Carol Gilligan and radical feminist theologian Mary Daly, is \"essentialist.\" In philosophy essentialism is the belief that \"(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties.\" In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that \"women\" and \"men\" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of \"essentialism\" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence, and do not accurately reflect Gilligan or Daly's views.\n\n"}

Their work on the subject began in the 10th century and continued to Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi of the middle 13th century and beyond. Although the Liar paradox has been well known in Greek and Latin traditions, the works of Arabic scholars have only recently been translated into English.\n\nEach group of early Islamic philosophers discussed different problems presented by the paradox. They pioneered unique solutions that were not influenced by Western ideas.\n\nAthīr al-Dīn Mufaḍḍal (b. ʿUmar Abharī, d. 663/1264) was a Persian philosopher, astronomer and mathematician from the city of Abhar in Persia. There is some speculation that his works on the Liar paradox could have been known to Western logicians, and in particular to Thomas Bradwardine.\n\nHe analyzed the Liar sentence as follows:\n\nIn other words, Athīr says that if the Liar sentence is false, which means that the Liar falsely declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is true; and, if the Liar sentence is true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is false. In any case, the Liar sentence is both true and false at the same time, which is a paradox.\n\nAthīr offers the following solution for the paradox:\n\nAccording to the traditional idealization that presumably was used by Athīr, the sentence as an universal proposition is false only, when \"either it has a counter-instance or its subject term is empty\".\n\n\nThe Liar sentence, however, has neither an empty subject nor counter-instance. This fact creates obstacles for Athīr's view, who must show what is unique about the Liar sentence, and how the Liar sentence still could be only true or false in view of the \"true\" and \"false\" conditions set up in the universal proposition's description. Athīr tries to solve the paradox by applying to it the laws of negation of a conjunction and negation of a disjunction.\n\nAhmed Alwishah, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic Philosophy and David Sanson, who has a Ph.D. in Philosophy explain that Athīr actually claims that:\n\n(1) \"It is not the case that, if the Liar Sentence is not both true and false, then it is true.\"\n\nAlwishah and Sanson continue:\n\"The general principle behind (1) is clear enough: the negation of a conjunction does not entail the negation of a conjunct; so from not both true and false you cannot infer not false and so true. Abharī appears to be saying that the Liar rests on an elementary scope fallacy! But, of course, Abharī is not entitled to (1). In some cases, the negation of a conjunction does entail the negation of a conjunct: 'not both P and P' for example, entails 'not P'. As a general rule, the negation of a conjunction entails the negation of each conjunct whenever the conjuncts are logically equivalent, i.e., whenever the one follows from the other and vice verse. So Abharī is entitled to (1) only if he is entitled to assume that ‘The Liar Sentence is true’ and ‘The Liar Sentence is false’ are not logically equivalent.\"\n\nThe Liar sentence is a universal proposition (The Liar says All I say ...), so \"if it is (non–vacuously) false it must have a counter–instance\". But in this case scenario, when the only thing that the liar is saying is the single sentence declaring that what he is saying at the moment is false, the only available counter–instance is the Liar sentence itself. When staging the paradox Abharī said: \"if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is necessarily true and false\" So the explanation provided by Abharī himself demonstrates that both \"'The Liar Sentence is false' and 'The Liar Sentence is true' are logically equivalent. If they are logically equivalent, then, contrary to (1), the negation of the conjunction does entail the negation of each conjunct. Abharī’s 'solution; therefore fails.\"\n\nNaṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī was a Persian polymath and prolific writer: an astronomer, biologist, chemist, mathematician, philosopher, physician, physicist, scientist, theologian and Marja Taqleed. He adhered to the Ismaili, and subsequently Twelver Shī‘ah Islamic belief systems. The Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars.\n\nṬūsī's work on the paradox begins with a discussion of the paradox and the solution offered by Abharī, with which Ṭūsī disagrees. As Alwishah and Sanson point out \"Ṭūsī argues that whatever fancy thing (conjunction, conditional) Abharī wants to identify as the truth condition for the Liar Sentence, it will not matter, because pace Abharī, we can generate the paradox without inferring, from the negation of a complex truth condition, the negation of one of its parts. We can argue directly that its being false entails the negation of its being false, and so entails its being true.\"\n\nṬūsī then prepares a stage for his own solution of the Liar paradox, writing that:\nHe does not see a reason that could prevent a declarative sentence to declare something about another declarative sentence.\n\nWith an example of two declarative sentences, (D1) \"It is false\" and (D2) \"Zayd is sitting\", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: \"It is false that Zayd is sitting\". There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) falsely declares itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being \"false\" creates a paradox.\n\nṬūsī writes: \n\nThe above conclusions are very important to the history of Liar Paradox. Alwishah and Sanson point out: \"It is hard to overemphasize how remarkable this passage is. The contemporary reader will be familiar with the idea that the Liar Paradox is a paradox of selfreference. But Ṭūsī is, as far as we know, the first person to express this idea. This passage has no precedent in any tradition. Ṭūsī has performed three remarkable feats in short order. First, his Liar Sentence is singular: its subject is itself, and it declares itself to be false. Gone, then, is the choice between universal or particular Liar Sentence, and the associated problem of adding further assumptions to generate a genuine paradox. Second, he has characterized the paradox as one of self-reference. Third, he has identified a key assumption that might be responsible for generating the entire problem: the assumption that a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything.\"\n\nRecognizing that, if a declarative sentence that declares itself being false, is false, this does not necessitate it being true. Ṭūsī says that it would be absurd to say that this declarative sentence is true only because it is not false. Ṭūsī writes:\n\nṬūsī then interprets the definitions of \"true\" and \"false\", in an attempt to prove that those definitions should not be taken into consideration when dealing with a declarative sentence that declares itself, as its own subject, to be false.\n\nAl-Baghdādī's definition of \"truth\" and \"falsity\" says that: \"truth is an agreement with the subject, and falsity is the opposite of that\". Ṭūsī argues that this definition cannot be applied to a declarative sentence that declares its own subject to be false because then there are at least two opposite parts that are in disagreement with each other. The same subject cannot be in disagreement with itself. Therefore a self–referenced declarative sentence that declares itself to be false is neither false nor true, and truth/falsity definitions are not applicable to those sentences.\n\nṬūsī stopped short from offering a solution for the Liar sentences discussed by Āmidī \"All that I say at this moment is false\". This sentence presents a different case scenario because it can be interpreted as declaring something about itself, and something about another sentence. The solution for this paradox is absent from Ṭūsī's papers.\n"}

The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually \"referred\" to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. Indices are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually (e.g. \"Whitaker's Almanack\", \"Who's Who\"). Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists). Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as application software, CD-ROMs, DVDs, or online through the Internet.\n\nA reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of trust.\n\nIn comparison, a reference book or reference-only book in a library is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from circulating items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.\n\nAn electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.

A 1999 report from the International Federation of Library Associations identified several advantages and disadvantages with roving reference in the pre-mobile era. The roving model allowed librarians to engage with \"the majority of users who have questions in mind [who] do not approach the reference desk for assistance\". However, libraries reported that some staff were uncomfortable with the practice, and that there were concerns about user privacy.\n\nBeginning in the 2000s, librarians used laptops or laptop carts to engage in technology-supported roaming reference. Since the development of mobile technologies, roving reference can be facilitated with the use of such technologies, such as tablet computers, which allow librarians to readily check the online public access catalogue or the library's electronic databases while away from their desk. This has contributed to the increased popularization of roving-reference programs as supplements for more traditional reference desks. The model has also been extended to service beyond the library building (library outreach), for example in a dormitory or faculty building at an academic institution.\n"}

Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self-referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience. \n\nSelf-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the fourth wall to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.\n\nOld Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.\n\nRAS syndrome refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words.

{"id": "738307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738307", "title": "Stephanus pagination", "text": "Stephanus pagination\n\nStephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the three volume 1578 edition of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva.\n\nIn the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e. This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato. For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage. For example, \"\"Symposium\" 172a\" cites \"Symposium\", Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which \"Symposium\" occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a. To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, \"page 50\" might refer to any of the \"pages 50\" across Stephanus' three volumes. Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.\n\nMore specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. \"Symposium\" 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in John Burnet's Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne's line divisions.\n\nThere are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\". The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. \n\nThe spurious dialogue \"Halcyon\" was included in the corpus of Lucian's works and does not have Stephanus numbers.\n\nBekker numbering is the comparable system for the works of Aristotle, and Diels–Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
