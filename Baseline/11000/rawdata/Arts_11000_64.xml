'''Georges André Malraux''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe malʁo|lang}}; 3 November 1901 – 23 November 1976) was a French novelist, art theorist and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]]. Malraux's novel ''La Condition Humaine'' ([[Man's Fate]]) (1933) won the [[Prix Goncourt]]. He was appointed by President [[Charles de Gaulle]] as Minister of Information (1945–46) and subsequently as France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs during de Gaulle's presidency (1959–69).

==Early years==
Malraux was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Fernand-Georges Malraux (1875-1930) and Berthe Félicie Lamy (1877-1932). His parents separated in 1905 and eventually divorced. There are suggestions that Malraux's paternal grandfather committed suicide in 1909.&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html "Biographie détaillée"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011 }}, André Malraux Website, accessed 3 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was raised by his mother, maternal aunt Marie Lamy and maternal grandmother, Adrienne Lamy (née Romagna), who had a grocery store in the small town of [[Bondy]].&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a stockbroker, committed suicide in 1930 after the international [[Stock market crash|crash of the stock market]] and onset of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  From his childhood, associates noticed that André had marked nervousness and motor and vocal tics. The recent biographer Olivier Todd, who published a book on Malraux in 2005, suggests that he had [[Tourette's syndrome]], although that has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Knorr&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/31/style/31iht-malraux_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1| title=Andre Malraux, the Great Pretender| author=Katherine Knorr| date= 31 May 2001| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, most critics have not seen this as a significant factor in Malraux's life or literary works.

The young Malraux left formal education early, but he followed his curiosity through the booksellers and museums in Paris, and explored its rich libraries as well.

==Career==

===Early years===
Malraux's first published work, an article entitled "The Origins of Cubist Poetry", appeared in the magazine ''Action'' in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by three semi-surrealist tales, one of which, "Paper Moons", was illustrated by Fernand Léger. Malraux also frequented the Parisian artistic and literary milieux of the period, meeting figures such as [[Demetrios Galanis]], [[Max Jacob]], [[François Mauriac]], [[Guy de Pourtalès]], [[André Salmon]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Raymond Radiguet]], [[Florent Fels]], [[Pascal Pia]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Edmond Jaloux]], and [[Pierre Mac Orlan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html Biographie détaillée] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011 }}. Malraux.org. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Malraux married [[Clara Malraux|Clara Goldschmidt]]. Malraux and his first wife separated in 1938 but didn't divorce until 1947. His daughter from this marriage, Florence (b. 1933), married the filmmaker [[Alain Resnais]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of twenty, Malraux was reading the work of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who was to remain a major influence on him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Batchelor pages 218-229"&gt;Batchelor, R "The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux" pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was especially impressed with Nietzsche's theory of a world in continuous turmoil and his statement "that the individual himself is still the most recent creation" who was completely responsible for all of his actions.&lt;ref name="Batchelor pages 218-229"/&gt; Most of all, Malraux embraced Nietzsche's theory of the ''[[Übermensch]]'', the heroic, exalted man who would create great works of art and whose will would allow him to triumph over anything.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, R "The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux" pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indochina===
The British Colonel [[T. E. Lawrence]], aka "Lawrence of Arabia", holds a sinister reputation in France as the man who was supposedly responsible for France's troubles in Syria in the 1920s. An exception was Malraux who regarded Lawrence as a role model, the intellectual-cum-man of action and the romantic, enigmatic hero.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often admitted to having a "certain fascination" with Lawrence, and it has been suggested that Malraux's sudden decision to abandon the Surrealist literary scene in Paris for adventure in the Far East was prompted by a desire to emulate Lawrence who began his career as an archaeologist in the Ottoman Empire excavating the ruins of the ancient city of [[Carchemish]] in the ''vilayet'' of Aleppo in what is now modern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lawrence had first made his reputation in the Near East digging up the ruins of an ancient civilization, it was only natural that Malraux should go to the Far East to likewise make his reputation in Asia digging up ancient ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence considered himself a writer first and foremost while also presenting himself as a man of action, the ''Nietzschean'' hero who triumphs over both the environment and men through the force of his will, a persona that Malraux consciously imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often wrote about Lawrence, whom he described admiringly as a man with a need for "the absolute", for whom no compromises were possible and for whom going all the way was the only way.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Malraux argued that Lawrence should not be remembered mainly as a guerrilla leader in the Arab Revolt and the British liaison officer with the Emir Faisal, but rather as a romantic, lyrical writer as writing was Lawrence's first passion, which also described Malraux very well.&lt;ref name="Roak pages 218-224"&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malraux courted fame through his novels, poems and essays on art in combination with his adventures and political activism, he was an intensely shy and private man who kept to himself, maintaining a distance between himself and others.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"&gt;Langlois, Walter "André Malraux (1901-1976)" pages 683-687 from ''The French Review'', Vol. 50, No. 5, April 1977 page 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's reticence led his first wife Clara to later say she barely knew him during their marriage.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"/&gt;

In 1923, aged 22, Malraux and Clara left for the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angkor Wat]] is a huge 12th century Hindu temple situated in the old capital of the Khmer empire. Angkor ([[Yasodharapura]]) was "the world's largest urban settlement" in the 11th and 12th centuries supported by an elaborate network of canals and roads across mainland Southeast Asia before decaying and falling into the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Upon reaching Cambodia, Malraux, Clara and friend Louis Chevasson undertook an expedition into unexplored areas of the former imperial settlements in search of hidden temples, hoping to find artifacts and items that could be sold to art collectors and museums. At about the same time archaeologists, with the approval of the French government, were removing large numbers of items from Angkor - many of which are now housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris. On his return, Malraux was arrested and charged by French colonial authorities for removing a ''[[bas-relief]]'' from the exquisite ''[[Banteay Srei]]'' temple. Malraux, who believed he had acted within the law as it then stood, contested the charges but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1247202/Hierarchies_of_value_at_Angkor_Wat Hierarchies of value at Angkor Wat | Lindsay French]. Academia.edu. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux's experiences in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] led him to become highly critical of the French colonial authorities there. In 1925, with Paul Monin,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Le Jariel, L'ami oublié de Malraux en Indochine, Paul Monin (1890-1929)&lt;/ref&gt; a progressive lawyer, he helped to organize the [[Young Annam League]] and founded a newspaper ''[[L'Indochine]]'' to champion Vietnamese independence.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 86–96&lt;/ref&gt; After falling afoul of the French authorities, Malraux claimed to have crossed over to China where he was involved with the [[Kuomintang]] and their then allies, the Chinese Communists in their struggle against the warlords in the Great Northern Expedition before they turned on each other in 1927, which marked the beginning of the Chinese Civil War that was to last on and off until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Malraux did not first visit China until 1931 and he did not see the bloody suppression of the Chinese Communists by the Kuomintang in 1927 first-hand as he often implied that he did, although he did do much reading on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Asian novels===
On his return to France, Malraux published ''[[The Temptation of the West]]'' (1926). The work was in the form of an exchange of letters between a Westerner and an Asian, comparing aspects of the two cultures. This was followed by his first novel ''The Conquerors'' (1928), and then by ''The Royal Way'' (1930) which reflected some of his Cambodian experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The American literary critic Dennis Roak described ''Les Conquérants'' as influenced by ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' as it was narrated in the present tense "...with its staccato snatches of dialogue and the images of sound and sight, light and darkness, which create a compellingly haunting atmosphere."&lt;ref name="Roak pages 218-224"/&gt; ''Les Conquérants'' was set in the summer of 1925 against the backdrop of the general strike called by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Canton, the novel concerns political intrigue amongst the "anti-imperialist" camp.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 45"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is narrated by an unnamed Frenchman who travels from Saigon to Hong Kong to Canton to meet an old friend named Garine who is a professional revolutionary working with [[Mikhail Borodin]], who in real life was the Comintern's principle agent in China.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 45"/&gt; The Kuomintang are depicted rather unflatteringly as conservative Chinese nationalists uninterested in social reform, another faction is led by Hong, a Chinese assassin committed to revolutionary violence for the sake of violence, and only the Communists are portrayed relatively favorably.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 46"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the dramatic tension between the novel concerns a three-way struggle between the hero, Garine and Borodin who is only interested in using the revolution in China to achieve Soviet foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 46"/&gt; The fact that the European characters are considerably better drawn than the Asian characters reflected Malraux's understanding of China at the time more of an exotic place where Europeans played out their own dramas rather than a place to be understood in its own right. Initially, Malraux's writings on Asia reflected the influence of "[[Orientalism]]" presenting the Far East as strange, exotic, decadent, mysterious, sensuous and violent, but Malraux's picture of China grew somewhat more humanized and understanding as Malraux disregarded his Orientalist and Eurocentric viewpoint in favor of one that presented the Chinese as fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 pages 11 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of Malraux's Asian novels was the semi-autobiographical [[The Royal Way|''La Voie Royale'']] which relates the adventures of a Frenchman Claude Vannec who together with his Danish friend Perken head down the royal road of the title into the jungle of [[Cambodia]] with the intention of stealing bas-relief sculptures from the ruins of Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 69.&lt;/ref&gt; After many perilous adventures, Vannec and Perken are captured by hostile tribesmen and find an old friend of Perken's  Grabot who has already been captured for some time.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Grabot, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion has been reduced to nothing as his captors have blinded him and left him tied to a stake starving, a stark picture of human degradation.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; The three Europeans escape, but Perken is wounded and dies of an infection.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; Through ostensibly an adventure novel, ''La Voie Royale'' is in fact a philosophical novel concerned with existential questions about the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; The book was a failure at the time as the publishers marketed it as a stirring  adventure story set in far-off, exotic Cambodia which confused many readers who instead found a novel pondering deep philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Asian novels, Malraux used Asia as a stick to beat Europe with, as he argued that after World War I, the ideal of progress, of a Europe getting better and better for the general advancement of humanity was dead.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 561&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Malraux now argued that European civilization was faced with a ''Nietzschean'' void, a twilight world without God or progress, in which the old values had proven worthless and a sense of spirituality that had once existed was gone.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; An agnostic, but an intensely spiritual man, Malraux maintained what was needed was an "aesthetic spirituality" in which love of art and civilization would allow one to appreciate ''le sacré'' in life, a sensibility that was both tragic and awe-inspiring as one surveyed all of the cultural treasures of the world, a mystical sense of humanity's place in a universe that was as astonishingly beautiful as it was mysterious.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; Malraux argued that as death is inevitable and in a world devoid of meaning, which thus was "absurd", only art could offer meaning in an "absurd" world.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"&gt;Sypher, Wylie "Aesthetic of Doom: Malraux" pages 146-165 from ''Salmagundi'', No. 68/69, Fall 1985-Winter 1986 page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux argued that art transcended time as art allowed one to connect with the past, and the very act of appreciating art was itself an act of art as the love of art was part of a continuation of endless artistic metamorphosis that constantly creating something new.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt; Malraux argued that as different types of art went in and out of style, the revival of a style was a metamorphosis as art could never be appreciated in exactly the same way as it was in the past.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt;  As art was timeless, it conquered time and death as artworks lived on after the death of the artist.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt; The American literary critic Jean-Pierre Hérubel wrote that Malraux never entirely worked out a coherent philosophy as his mystical ''Weltanschauung'' (world view) was based more upon emotion than logic.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; In Malraux's viewpoint, of all the professions, the artist was the most important as artists were the explorers and voyagers of the human spirit as artistic creation was the highest form of human achievement for only art could illustrate humanity's relationship with the universe as Malraux wrote "there is something far greater than history and it is the persistence of genius".&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; Hérubel argued that it is fruitless to attempt to criticize Malraux for his lack of methodological consistency as Malraux cultivated a poetical sensibility, a certain lyrical style that appealed more to the heart than to the brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 562&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was a proud Frenchman, but he also saw himself as a citizen of the world, a man who loved the cultural achievements of all of the civilizations across the globe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the same time, Malraux criticized those intellectuals who wanted to retreat into the ivory tower, instead arguing that it was the duty of intellectuals to participate and fight (both metaphorically and literally) in the great political causes of the day, that the only truly great causes were the ones that one was willing to die for.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"/&gt;

In 1933 Malraux published ''[[Man's Fate]]'' (''La Condition Humaine''), a novel about the 1927 [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|failed Communist rebellion in Shanghai]]. Despite Malraux's attempts to present his Chinese characters as more three dimensional and developed than he did in ''Les Conquérants'' , his biographer Oliver Todd wrote he could not "quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes", which were the standard French stereotypes of China at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Oliver ''Malraux: A Life'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was awarded the 1933 [[Prix Goncourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 170–181&lt;/ref&gt; After the breakdown of his marriage with Clara, Malraux lived with journalist and novelist [[Josette Clotis]], starting in 1933. Malraux and Josette had two sons: Pierre-Gauthier (1940–1961) and Vincent (1943–1961). During 1944, while Malraux was fighting in [[Alsace]], Josette died, aged 34, when she slipped while boarding a train. His two sons died together in 1961 in an automobile accident.

===Searching for lost cities===
On 22 February 1934, Malraux together with [[Édouard Corniglion-Molinier]] embarked on a much publicized expedition to find the lost capital of the [[Queen of Sheba]] mentioned in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and Yemen were both remote, dangerous places that few Westerners visited at the time, and what made the expedition especially dangerous was while Malraux was searching for the lost cities of Sheba, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen, and the ensuing Saudi–Yemeni war greatly complicated Malraux's search.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, Walter ''In search of Sheba: an Arabian adventure : André Malraux and Edouard Corniglon-Molinier, Yemen, 1934'' Knoxville: Malraux Society, 2006 pages 267-269&lt;/ref&gt; After several weeks of flying over the deserts in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Malraux returned to France to announce that ruins he found up in the mountains of Yemen were the capital of the Queen of Sheba.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"/&gt; Through Malraux's claim is not generally accepted by archeologists, the expedition bolstered Malraux's fame and provided the material for several of his later essays.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"/&gt;

===Spanish Civil War===
During the 1930s, Malraux was active in the anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in France. At the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] forces in Spain, serving in and helping to organize the small Spanish Republican Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 228–242&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis Cate, one of his biographers, writes that Malraux was slightly wounded twice during efforts to stop the Battle of [[Madrid]] in 1936 as the Spanish Nationalists attempted to take Madrid, but the historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] argues otherwise.

The French government sent aircraft to Republican forces in Spain, but they were obsolete by the standards of 1936. They were mainly [[Potez 540]] bombers and [[Dewoitine D.372]] fighters. The slow Potez 540 rarely survived three months of air missions, flying at 160 knots against enemy fighters flying at more than 250 knots. Few of the fighters proved to be airworthy, and they were delivered intentionally without guns or [[sight (device)|gunsights]]. The Ministry of Defense of France had feared that modern types of planes would easily be captured by the German [[Condor Legion]] fighting with General [[Francisco Franco]], and the lesser models were a way of maintaining official "neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The planes were surpassed by more modern types introduced by the end of 1936 on both sides.

The Republic circulated photos of Malraux standing next to some Potez 540 bombers suggesting that France was on their side, at a time when France and the United Kingdom had declared official neutrality. But Malraux's commitment to the Republicans was personal, like that of many other foreign volunteers, and there was never any suggestion that he was there at the behest of the French Government. Malraux himself was not a pilot, and never claimed to be one, but his leadership qualities seem to have been recognized because he was made Squadron Leader of the 'España' squadron. Acutely aware of the Republicans' inferior armaments, of which outdated aircraft were just one example, he toured the United States to raise funds for the cause. In 1938 he published ''[[Man's Hope|L'Espoir]]'' (Man's Hope), a novel influenced by his Spanish war experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n15/john-sturrock/the-man-from-nowhere| title=The Man from Nowhere| author=John Sturrock| work=The London Review of Books| volume= 23| number= 15 | date= 9 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux's participation in major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War inevitably brought him determined adversaries as well as strong supporters, and the resulting polarization of opinion has colored, and rendered questionable, much that has been written about his life. Fellow combatants praised Malraux's leadership and sense of camaraderie&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009). pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[André Marty]] of the [[Comintern]] called him as an "adventurer" for his high profile and demands on the Spanish Republican government.&lt;ref name="Beevor, p. 140"&gt;Beevor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] also claims that "Malraux stands out, not just because he was a mythomaniac in his claims of martial heroism – in Spain and later in the French Resistance – but because he cynically exploited the opportunity for intellectual heroism in the legend of the Spanish Republic."&lt;ref name="Beevor, p. 140"/&gt; Both these claims are highly questionable. Malraux's only work about the Spanish Revolution was a novel – in which he does not figure at all. His later works occasionally describe episodes during the Resistance&lt;ref&gt;Mainly the first volume of his ''Antimémoires''.&lt;/ref&gt; but in none of them does he make anything resembling "claims of martial heroism". Indeed, in one episode, he portrays himself in a somewhat unflattering light.

In any case, Malraux's participation in events such as the Spanish Civil War has tended to distract attention from his important literary achievement. Malraux saw himself first and foremost as a writer and thinker (and not a "man of action" as biographers so often portray him) but his extremely eventful life – a far cry from the stereotype of the French intellectual confined to his study or a Left Bank café – has tended to obscure this fact. As a result, his literary works, including his important works on the theory of art, have received less attention than one might expect, especially in Anglophone countries.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Malraux joined the [[French Army]]. He was captured in 1940 during the [[Battle of France]] but escaped and later joined the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 278–287&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he was captured by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 328–332&lt;/ref&gt; He later commanded the [[Brigade Alsace-Lorraine]] in defence of [[Strasbourg]] and in the attack on [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 340–349&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Abetz]] was the German Ambassador, and produced a series of "black lists" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. [[Louis Aragon]] and André Malraux were both on these "Otto Lists" of forbidden authors.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Malraux was awarded the ''[[Médaille de la Résistance]]'' and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]. The British awarded him the [[Distinguished Service Order]], for his work with British liaison officers in [[Corrèze]], Dordogne and [[Lot (department)|Lot]]. After Dordogne was liberated, Malraux led a battalion of former resistance fighters to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where they fought alongside the [[First Army (France)|First Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7792088|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Malraux, Andre|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, he worked on his last novel, ''The Struggle with the Angel'', the title drawn from the story of the Biblical [[Jacob]]. The manuscript was destroyed by the Gestapo after his capture in 1944. A surviving first section, titled ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.

===After the war===

Kennedy]], Marie-Madeleine Lioux, André Malraux, U.S. First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], and U.S. Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] at an unveiling of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C. Mrs. Kennedy described Malraux as "the most fascinating man I've ever talked to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/us/12jackie.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | first=Janny | last=Scott | title=In Oral History, Jacqueline Kennedy Speaks Candidly After the Assassination | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Shortly after the war, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] appointed Malraux as his Minister for Information (1945–1946). Soon after, he completed his first book on art, ''The Psychology of Art'', published in three volumes (1947–1949). The work was subsequently revised and republished in one volume as ''The Voices of Silence'' (''Les Voix du Silence''), the first part of which has been published separately as ''The Museum without Walls''. Other important works on the theory of art were to follow. These included the three-volume ''Metamorphosis of the Gods'' and ''Precarious Man and Literature'', the latter published posthumously in 1977. In 1948, Malraux married a second time, to [[Marie-Madeleine Lioux]], a concert pianist and the widow of his half-brother, Roland Malraux. They separated in 1966. Subsequently, Malraux lived with [[Louise de Vilmorin]] in the Vilmorin family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but mordant tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu. Her most famous novel was ''Madame de...'', published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film ''[[The Earrings of Madame de…]]'' (1953), directed by Max Ophüls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin's other works included ''Juliette'', ''La lettre dans un taxi'', ''Les belles amours'', ''Saintes-Unefois'', and ''Intimités''. Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. After Louise's death, Malraux spent his final years with her relative, Sophie de Vilmorin.

In 1957, Malraux published the first volume of his trilogy on art entitled ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods''. The second two volumes (not yet translated into English) were published shortly before he died in 1976. They are entitled ''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'' and discuss artistic developments from the Renaissance to modern times. Malraux also initiated the series ''[[Arts of Mankind]]'', an ambitious survey of world art that generated more than thirty large, illustrated volumes.

When de Gaulle returned to the French presidency in 1958, Malraux became France's first [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]], a post he held from 1958 to 1969. On 7 February 1962, Malraux was the target of assassination attempt by the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS) who set off a bomb to his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target, but did leave a four-year girl living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Todd ''The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008 page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Malraux was a lukewarm supporter of de Gaulle's decision to grant [[Évian Accords|independence to Algeria]], but the OAS was not aware of this, and had decided to assassinate Malraux as a high-profile minister.

Among many initiatives, Malraux launched an innovative (and subsequently widely imitated) program to clean the blackened façades of notable French buildings, revealing the natural stone underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian.  Entry for AM in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' (Oxford, 2004).  Accessed on 6/28/11 at: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andre_Malraux.aspx#4&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a number of ''maisons de la culture'' in provincial cities and worked to preserve France's national heritage by promoting [[industrial archaeology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 557&lt;/ref&gt; An intellectual who took the arts very seriously, Malraux saw his mission as Culture Minister to preserve France's heritage and to improve the cultural levels of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 556-557&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's efforts to promote French culture mostly concerned renewing old or building new libraries, art galleries, museums, theatres, opera houses, and ''maisons de la culture'' (centres built in provincial cities that were a mixture of a library, art gallery and theatre).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Film, television and music took less of Malraux's time, and the changing demographics caused by immigration from the Third World stymied his efforts to promote French high culture, as many immigrants from Muslim and African nations did not find French high culture that compelling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A passionate bibliophile, Malraux built up a huge collections of books both as a cultural minister for the nation and as a man for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was an outspoken supporter of the Bangladesh liberation movement during the 1971 [[Pakistani Civil War]] and despite his age seriously considered joining the struggle. When [[Indira Gandhi]] came to Paris in November 1971, there was extensive discussion between them about the situation in Bangladesh.

During this post-war period, Malraux published a series of semi-autobiographical works, the first entitled ''Antimémoires'' (1967). A later volume in the series, ''Lazarus'', is a reflection on death occasioned by his experiences during a serious illness. ''La Tête d'obsidienne'' (1974) (translated as ''Picasso's Mask'') concerns Picasso, and visual art more generally. In his last book, published posthumously in 1977, ''L'Homme précaire et la littérature'', Malraux propounded the theory that there was a ''bibliothèque imaginaire'' where writers created works that influenced subsequent writers much as painters learned their craft by studying the old masters; once they have understood the work of the old masters, writers would sally forth with the knowledge gained to create new works that added to the growing and never-ending  ''bibliothèque imaginaire''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An elitist who appreciated what he saw as the high culture of all the nations of the world, Malraux was especially interested in art history and archaeology, and saw his duty as a writer to share what he knew with ordinary people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An aesthete, Malraux believed that art was spiritually enriching and necessary for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 557-558&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux died in [[Créteil]], near Paris, on 23 November 1976. He was buried in the [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (Essonne) cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to French culture, his ashes were moved to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris during 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of his death.

There is now a large and steadily growing body of critical commentary on Malraux's literary ''œuvre'', including his very extensive writings on art. Unfortunately, some of his works, including the last two volumes of ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods'' (''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'') are not yet available in English translation.  Malraux's works on the theory of art contain a revolutionary approach to art that challenges the Enlightenment tradition that treats art simply as a source of "aesthetic pleasure". However, as French writer [[André Brincourt]] has commented, Malraux's books on art have been "skimmed a lot but very little read"&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art, Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; (this is especially true in Anglophone countries) and the radical implications of his thinking are often missed. A particularly important aspect of Malraux's thinking about art is his explanation of the capacity of art to transcend time. In contrast to the traditional notion that art endures because it is timeless ("eternal"), Malraux argues that art lives on through metamorphosis – a process of resuscitation (where the work had fallen into obscurity) and transformation in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan.

'''Haroutin "Ariel" Pascale Agemian''' ({{lang-hy|Հարություն "Արիել" Ստեփանի Աճեմյան}}, 1904–1963) was an [[Armenian people|Armenian]] artist who worked predominately in [[Italy]].

==Life==
Of Armenian descent, Agemian was originally from [[Bursa]], Turkey, and graduated from the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]] with a Gold Medal Award from the Associazione Artistica in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agemianpaintings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Clement_Morro__La_Revue_Moderne__1934.pdf|title=Ariel Adjemian|last=Morro|first=Clement|date=1934|work=La Revue Moderne|publication-place=Paris|access-date=2016-06-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Armenian Genocide]], Agemian witnessed his father get killed. He was then separated from his family and sent to Venice for study. Up to 1931, he worked and taught in Italy and from 1931 to 1938 in Paris. Agemian was a representative of the school of academic realism and a skillful master of composition. He has painted national themes reflecting the ancient as well as the contemporary history of the Armenian people, frequently inspired by the distinct decorative-allegorical paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Agemian was also a portraitist and a landscapist. He has painted murals with spiritual as well as secular themes. They can be found in [[Armenian Catholic]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic]] Churches in France, Italy, Turkey, and in America in New York City, Belmont, and Indian Orchard, Massachusetts. In addition to those works, there are paintings in the [[Mekhitarist]] College in Venice, the Monastery on the Island of [[San Lazzaro degli Armeni]] and also several homes of friends in the United States.

==Career in art==
His artistic career started in France. During the period 1931 to 1938, his paintings were widely exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Venice, and Milan. He was primarily concerned with religious art and profane subjects. He began to paint prolifically after resigning as art professor at the College Moorat in [[Sèvres]], France. Agemian’s mural technique reflected the influence of [[Old Masters]] such as [[Titian]]. As time went on, he showed himself to be versatile, equally at home with small compositions as well as monumental murals. Subjects included portraits, still life, landscapes, nudes, figures and battle scenes. His portraits were of dignitaries from the political, religious, and entertainment world. They included [[Giovanni Martinelli]], Akim Tamiroff's wife, Louis Martin, Minister of the French Navy, [[Pope Pius XI]], and Cardinal [[Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian]]. He is most well known for the "Face of Christ" painted in 1935 and based on the negative of the [[Shroud of Turin]].

Agemian, who was a religious man, was still nourishing the seed of a priestly vocation. He also wanted to spend some time in America and study the American people for a series of tableaux on democracy. Thus his decision to spend several months in the United States. This move in 1938 signaled the start of a new era for the young artist. An art exhibit in 1939 in New York was described as one of the most extraordinary assemblages to be seen on art gallery row in a long time. Critics proclaimed that “the artist reveals a diversifying talent with the ability to deal with formal organization; a nice color sense; and a generally romantic approach”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agemianpaintings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Exhibition_of_Paintings_of_Noted_Foreign_Artist__April_17__1939.pdf|title=Exhibition Of Paintings Of Noted Foreign Artist|last=Corrao, Jr.|first=Turi|date=1939-04-19|work=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Morristown Daily Record]]|access-date=2016-06-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was "obviously trained in European traditions of sound craftsmanship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agemianpaintings.homestead.com/Articles/Agemian_Paintings_not_typical_local_display.pdf|title=Agemian Paintings Not Typical Local Display; Range is from Artificial Paradise to Ascension|last=Edmonds|first=Carol|date=December 1973|work=[[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]]|access-date=2016-06-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Ariel Agemian arrived in America, he set up a studio in New York City where he taught art to now famous artists, [[Erik Schmidt (painter)|Erik Schmidt]] and Richard Mantia while he continued to paint. He perfected the use of pastels on construction and working with the dark to light concept with the [[Chiaroscuro]] effect. On black construction he used white chalk and brought life from the black background. Ariel married Maria Roxas in June, 1939. They had a son, Stefan, and a daughter, Annig.

In 1943 Agemian became an American citizen and began to work for Msgr. Joseph F. Stedman and then Msgr. Frey who were directors of the [[Confraternity of the Precious Blood]], a publishing house for Catholic literature in Brooklyn, New York. Agemian painted over 500 illustrations. They are in the books, ''My Daily Psalms'', ''Christ in the Gospel'', ''The Imitation of Christ'', ''My Meditation on the Gospel'' and ''My Mass''. His reproduction of Christ, from the [[Shroud of Turin]], is considered the most exact by experts in the scientific research field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peopleofar.com/2011/12/09/ariel-agemian-knight-of-st-gregory-1904-1963/|title=Ariel Agemian (Knight of St. Gregory) 1904-1963|date=2011-12-09|website=PeopleOfAr|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After coming to America, the artist’s technique and subject matter noticeably changed to purely religious. Only a few portraits of dear friends were painted during the next twenty years. He sketched daily, lived somewhat the life of a recluse and his works were not displayed publicly again after 1939.

In 1958, Ariel Agemian was given the highest honor bestowed upon a layman by the [[Catholic Church]]. He was awarded a Gold Medal from [[Pope Pius XII]] and knighted into the [[Order of Saint Gregory the Great]]. On March 10, 2012, Ariel Agemian was posthumously awarded a distinguished alumni honor as an artist given by the [[Mekhatarian Alumni Association]] in Toronto, Canada.

==Legacy==
His legacy lives on in his works. There have been several showings in the [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] and [[Glenwood Springs]] area in Colorado. Some religious works have been donated to museums in New York City, Holy Cross Armenian Catholic Church in Belmont, MA; St. Mark's in Wynnewood, PA; St. Bernard’s Church in New Broomfield, PA; [[Armenians in Italy#Collegio Armeno in Rome|Collegio Armeno in Rome]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agemianpaintings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Madonna_and_Child.pdf|title=Madonna and St. Gregory of Narek, Brooklyn Painter's Picture Hangs above Altar in Rome Church|last=|first=|date=1962-11-04|work=|access-date=2016-06-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yerevan]], Armenia. In 2011, the painting ''[[:Image:Christ in the Temple.jpeg|Christ in the Temple]]'', dedicated to the "Son of God coming into the Temple" feast in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]], was donated to [[Anna Maria College]] in Paxton, Massachusetts, also his daughter's alma mater. The majority of works done in America have been in the private collection of Howard and Annig Agemian Raley in [[Glenwood Springs]], Colorado. The latest exhibition was in January 2014 at the new Glenwood Springs Library in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

'''Axonometry''' is a graphical procedure belonging to [[descriptive geometry]] that generates a planar image of a three-dimensional object. The term "axonometry" means "to measure along axes", and indicates that the dimensions and scaling of the coordinate axes play a crucial role. The result of an axonometric procedure is a uniformly-scaled [[parallel projection]] of the object. In general, the resulting parallel projection is [[oblique projection|oblique]] (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane), which in this context is called an '''orthogonal axonometry'''.

In technical drawing and in architecture, axonometric perspective is a form of two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects  whose goal is to preserve the impression of volume or of relief. Sometimes also called rapid perspective or artificial perspective, it differs from conical perspective and does not represent what the eye actually sees: in particuliar parallel lines remain parallel and distant objects are not reduced in size. It can be considered a conical perspective conique whose center has been pushed out to infinity, i.e. very far from the object observed.

The term ''axonometry'' is used both for the graphical procedure described below, as well as the image ''produced'' by this procedure.
 
''Axonometry'' should not be confused with ''[[axonometric projection]]'', which in English literature usually refers to ''orthogonal axonometry''.

== Principle of axonometry ==
[[File:Axonom-def.svg|thumb|The point &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; onto the projection plane ''Π''. The foreshortenings are &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Pohlke's theorem]] is the basis for the following procedure to construct a scaled parallel projection of a three-dimensional object:{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=144}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=156}}
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select projections of the coordinate axes, such that all three coordinate axes are not collapsed to a single point or line. Usually the z-axis is vertical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select for these projections the [[foreshortening]]s, &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v_x,v_y,v_z &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projection &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is determined in three steps (the result is independent of the order of these steps):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting at the point &lt;math&gt;\overline O&lt;/math&gt;, move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_x\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline x&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_y\cdot y&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline y&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_z\cdot z&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt; and finally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark the final position as point &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In order to obtain undistorted results, select the projections of the axes and foreshortenings carefully (see below). In order to produce an [[orthographic projection]], only the projections of the coordinate axes are freely selected; the foreshortenings are fixed (see [[:de:orthogonale Axonometrie]]).{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=145}}

== The choice of the images of the axes and the forshortenings ==

[[File:Axo-parameter-gen.svg|thumb|Parameters and notations]]

'''Notation:'''
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;-axis
* &lt;math&gt;\beta:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and  &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt;-axis
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt;-axis.

The '''angles''' can be chosen so that &lt;math&gt;0^\circ&lt;\alpha+\beta&lt;360^\circ\ .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The '''forshortenings''': &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\; v_x,\; v_y,\; v_z\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Only for suitable choices of angles and forshortenings does one get undistorted images. The next diagram shows the images of the unit cube for various angles and forshortenings and gives some hints for how to make these personal choices.

[[File:Axonometry-var14.svg|600px|frame|none|Various axonometric images of a unit cube. (The image plane is  parallel to the y-z-plane.)&lt;br /&gt;
The left and the far right images look more like prolonged cuboids instead of a cube.]]

[[File:Haus-karo-axonometrie.svg|thumb|Axonometry (cavalier perspective) of a house on checked pattern paper.]] 
In order to keep the drawing simple, one should choose simple forshortenings, for example &lt;math&gt;1.0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;.

If two forshortenings are equal, the projection is called '''dimetric'''.&lt;br /&gt;
If the three forshortenings are equal, the projection is called '''isometric'''.&lt;br /&gt;
If all forshortenings are different, the projection is called '''trimetric'''.

The parameters in the diagram at right (e.g. of the house drawn on graph paper) are: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ, \beta =90^\circ,\ v_y=v_z=1,\; v_x=1/\sqrt{2}\ .&lt;/math&gt; Hence it is a ''dimetric'' axonometry. The image plane is parallel to the y-z-plane and any planar figure parallel to the y-z-plane appears in its true shape.

== Special axonometries ==

[[File:Axo-parameter-spec.svg|600px|frame|none|Parameters of special axonometries.]]

=== Engineer projection ===
In this case {{sfn|Graf|1961|p=155}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=168}}
* the ''forshortenings'' are: &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5, \ v_y=v_z=1\ &lt;/math&gt; (dimetric axonometry) and
* the ''angles'' between the axes are: &lt;math&gt; \alpha=132^\circ,\ \beta=97^\circ \ .&lt;/math&gt;
These angles are marked on many German [[set square]]s.

Advantages of an engineer projection: 
* simple forshortenings, 
* a uniformly scaled orthographic projection with scaling factor 1.06, 
* the contour of a sphere is a circle (in general, an ellipse) .
For more details: see [[:de:Axonometrie]].

=== Cavalier perspective, cabinet perspective ===
* image plane parallel to y-z-plane.
In the literature the terms "cavalier perspective" and "cabinet perspective" are not uniformly defined. The above definition is the most general one. Often, further restrictions are applied.{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=95}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=159}} For example: 
:cabinet perspective: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5&lt;/math&gt; (dimetric),
:cavalier perspective: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=1&lt;/math&gt; (isometric).

=== Birds eye view, military projection ===
* image plane parallel to x-y-plane. 
:military projection: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;v_z=1&lt;/math&gt; (isometric).
Such axonometries are often used for city maps, in order to keep horizontal figures undistorted.

=== Isometric axonometry ===
[[File:Axo-iso-beisp.svg|thumb|standard isometry: cube, cuboid, house and sphere]]
(Not to be confused with an [[isometry]] between metric spaces.)

For an '''isometric axonometry''' all forshortenings are equal. The angles can be chosen arbitrarily, but a common choice is &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=\gamma=120^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

For the '''standard isometry''' or just '''isometry''' one chooses:
* &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_y=v_z=1&lt;/math&gt; (all axes undistorted) 
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=\gamma=120^\circ\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of a standard isometry: 
* the coordinates can be taken unchanged, 
* the image is a scaled orthographic projection with scale factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1.5}=1.225&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the image has a good impression and the contour of a sphere is a circle.  
* Some computer graphic systems (for example, [[xfig]]) provide a suitable raster (see diagram) as support.
In order to prevent scaling, one can choose the unhandy forshortenings
* &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_y=v_z=\sqrt{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; (instead of 1)
and the image is an (unscaled) orthographic projection.

[[File:Axo-examples.svg|frame|none|500px|various axonometries of a tower&lt;br /&gt;
milit. proj.: &lt;math&gt;v_z=0.5\ ,&lt;/math&gt; caval. proj.: &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5\ ,&lt;/math&gt; isom. axonom.: &lt;math&gt;v=1&lt;/math&gt;]]

== Circles in axonometry ==
A parallel projection of a circle is in general an ellipse. An important special case occurs, if the circle's plane is parallel to the image plane&amp;ndash;the image of the circle is then a congruent circle. In the diagram, the circle contained in the front face is undistorted. If the image of a circle is an ellipse, one can map four points on orthogonal diameters and the surrounding square of tangents and in the image parallelogram fill-in an ellipse by hand. A better, but more time consuming method consists of drawing the images of two perpendicular diameters of the circle, which are conjugate diameters of the image ellipse, determining the axes of the ellipse with [[Rytz's construction]] and [[ellipse#drawing ellipses|drawing the ellipse]].
&lt;gallery widths="200" heights="200"&gt;
Axonometrie-kreise-c.svg|Cavalier perspective: circles
File:Kugel-vogelp.svg|Military projection: sphere
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Spheres in axonometry ==
In a general axonometry of a sphere the image contour is an ellipse. 
The contour of a sphere is a circle only in an ''orthogonal'' axonometry. But, as the engineer projection and the standard isometry are scaled orthographic projections, the contour of a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as the contour of a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere is part of an object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.

[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]]]
'''Bagism''' is a satire of prejudice, where by living in a bag a person could not be judged on their bodily appearance. Bagism was created by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize [[prejudice]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total [[communication]]: instead of focusing on outward [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], the listener would hear only the bagist's [[message]].

== Purpose and origins ==

John and Yoko introduced the idea during a well-received [[press conference]] in [[Vienna]] on 31 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1969.0331.beatles.html "John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono: Bagism Press Conference 3/31/1969"], The Beatles Ultimate Experience.&lt;/ref&gt; and explained it more thoroughly in a 14 June 1969 interview with [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/06/14/television-john-lennon-yoko-ono-david-frost-show/ "Television: John Lennon and Yoko Ono on The David Frost Show"], The Beatles' Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagism reflected the whimsical, carefree, and often [[comedy|comedic]] mood of John and Yoko's other peace efforts, such as their [[Bed-In]]s. By catching the attention of the masses with its outlandish premise, bagism presented a powerful social and [[politics|political]] message to the world. As Lennon stated, "Yoko and I are quite willing to be the world's [[clowns]]; if by doing it we do some good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iiRkfZ-UwE "John Lennon - Bagism"] Excerpt from the documentary ''Imagine: John Lennon'', (1988), YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoko said that bagism was inspired by the theme of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'', which was "One sees rightly only with the heart, the essential is invisible to the eyes."  She hoped that the bag (by hiding her and John's physical appearance) would make their essence, or the essence of their message, visible.

== The Alchemical Wedding ==

The couple had earlier appeared in a bag, at The Alchemical Wedding, an underground artists' gathering, at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in late 1968.  The event was put on by the [[Arts Lab]] and [[BIT (infoshop)]], which sought to challenge audiences to be participants rather than passive [[consumer]]s.  John and Yoko climbed into a large white bag on stage, sat cross-legged, knee-to-knee, hunkered down and closed the bag.  They moved only twice in 45 minutes, hunkering further down.  This was a strong challenge to the audience.

"Musicians played, poets ranted, and John and Yoko crept into their white sheet-like bag on the stage and stayed there out of sight for what seemed like ages. I watched a baby crawl slowly by. And that was the bag happening. All mayhem broke out when a young female member of the audience stripped off her clothes and danced in naked delight. When the police were called and attendants tried to remove her, groups of people started stripping off their clothes in solidarity. There was a retreat and a truce was worked out, and no-one was arrested. The nude girl incident, with accompanying photo, made the front pages of the London evening papers." As [[Lee Harris (South African artist)|Lee Harris]] noted later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeharris.co.uk/LeeHarris/Works/afootsol.htm Lee Harris' involvement with the Arts Lab and Alchemical Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bagism in the songs of John Lennon ==

Bagism is mentioned three times in the songs of John Lennon.  The first time is in "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]" where John refers to "eating chocolate cake in a bag", which was at the Vienna press conference, and the second is in the song "[[Come Together]]", where he sings: "He bag production".  This is a reference to Bag Productions Ltd, Lennon's public relations company, which derived its name from Bagism.  The third reference is in "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", with the line, "Everybody's talkin' about Bagism, Shagism, dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism, This-ism, That-ism, ism, ism, ism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hertzberg |first=Hendrik |date=5 July 2010 |title=Give John a Chance |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/give-john-a-chance |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |access-date=30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[website]] called [http://www.bagism.com/ Bagism] was created c. 1994 by Sam Choukri, providing John Lennon and Beatles links, photographs, rare [[sound recording]] snippets and [[video]]. At one point, c. 1996, the precursor to Bagism.com, a website focused on Lennon, was sent a [[cease and desist]] request from the representatives of his estate over copyrighted John Lennon content. After an unsuccessful [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/letter-to-yoko.html appeal] to Ono and the John Lennon Estate and the [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/dear-yoko.html Dear Yoko] [[petition]] campaign, Choukri decided to focus his efforts on less legally volatile content and the website has since been a hub for [[discussion]], detailed [[discography|discographies]], letters, [[article (publishing)|article]]s, [[fan (person)|fan]] [[Work of art|artwork]] and [[poetry]], and many other types of content.

In 2006, [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] had the words "Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism" stickered along the front windows of the airport. This was done along with the branding of various John Lennon lyrics around the inside of the airport.

In 2010, the studio band Strawberry Walrus recorded a song entitled "Bagism" and released it on their album ''This Is Not Here''.

Founded in 1855, the '''Amateur Dramatic Club''' (or ADC) is the oldest university dramatic society in [[England]] – and the largest dramatic society in [[Cambridge]].

The club stages a diverse range of productions every term, many of them at the fully equipped [[ADC Theatre]] in Park Street, where they are the resident company. They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad.

==History==

The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by [[F. C. Burnand|F.C. Burnand]] and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year.
The university’s response to the project was reported to have been ‘unfavourable’, but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved.
The club’s first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club’s first minute book reports that ‘the receipts were scanty, but a start was effected’.

Over the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily.
A contribution of £5 from each of the club’s members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened.

Though the university’s approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group.
Tragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire.
Support flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club.
The [[ADC Theatre]], now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn.

The club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adctheatre.com/potted.asp A Potted History of the ADC Theatre]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater [[ADC Theatre]], where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the [[Corpus Christi Playroom]], The Octagon at St Chad’s, King's College Lawn and the [[The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge|Round Church]].

Constitutionally, the club also has an obligation
&lt;blockquote&gt;to spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC Theatre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late-night experimental pieces known as One Night Stands.

==Membership==
Anybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the [[University of Cambridge]], or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;[http://cuadc.org/about-us/constitution/ CUADC Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
From time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership.
It is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons.

==Committee==
The club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university.
The President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term.
The committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual [[garden party]], annual dinner, and freshers' squash.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

There is also a senior treasurer, who, by university statutes, must be a senior member of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2008/chapter02-section17.html#heading2-19 Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge: Chapter Ii :  Matriculation, Residence, Admission to Degrees, Discipline  –  Discipline]&lt;/ref&gt; This post is currently held by Dr Richard Barnes, the vice-master of Emmanuel College and senior treasurer of Amalgamated Clubs.

The '''Canadian Historical Dinner Service''', originally called the '''Cabot Commemorative State Dinner Service''', is 204-piece eight-course dinner service with 24 place settings of hand-painted porcelain. It was created in 1896–97 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of Canada by [[John Cabot]]. The illustrations all have Canadian subjects, and no two pieces are the same.

==Background==
[[File:Soup plate - Entrance to Fort Lennox - Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith.jpg|thumb|Soup plate ''Entrance to Fort Lennox'' by Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith (1864-1941)]]
In 1896 the [[Woman's Art Association of Canada]] (WAAC) decided to commission a state dinner service to be painted on china by members of the association.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
The WAAC formed a Ceramic Committee, which pulled together photographs and drawings of old forts, battlefields and other historical scenes.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=41}}
The committee also assembled reproductions of Canadian game, fish, shells, ferns and flowers.
A competition of Canadian ceramic artists was held, and the work was divided among them "according to their individual proficiency in the painting of various subjects."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
The artists were to represent each province of Canada.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=41}}
In fact the chosen artists were from Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
Eight of the artists were from Toronto.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}

[[Mary Ella Dignam]], first president of the Women's Art Association of Canada, was the driving force behind production of the dinner service.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, WAAC}}
Dignam supervised the work of [[Alice Egan]] and other Ontario and Quebec artists.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
These included [[Lily Osman Adams]] (1865–1945) and [[Phoebe Amelia Watson]] (1858–1947).{{sfn|The Artists, Canadian Museum of History}}
The dinner service for eight courses with 24 place settings was to commemorate the 400th anniversary in 1897 of [[John Cabot]]'s discovery of Canada.{{sfn|Creating the Dinner Service, CMH}}
Sixteen Canadian women artists were chosen to paint the 204{{efn|One source gives 192 pieces.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, WAAC}} Another gives 204 pieces.{{sfn|Bryers|2007}} A third source inexplicably gives 208.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}} 8 courses and 24 settings would give 192 pieces, assuming a cup and saucer is considered one piece. The discrepancy between the first two may be due to whether or not the twelve coffee cups and saucers of Limoges porcelain are counted.}} china blanks with Canadian historical scenes and birds, ferns, fish, flowers and fruits.{{sfn|Bryers|2007}} 
They were given details of the plates or cups and saucers they were to paint, and worked independently.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}

The WAAC arranged to obtain the china blanks. According to the Secretary of the WAAC, E .J . Thompson, "our object was to get nothing but the best, for we want our State Set to be as near perfect as possible . . . . Sir [[Henry Doulton]] has taken quite an interest in our State Set and has given us the only plain china with the red factory mark that has ever left the factory to be decorated, and has sent us their best china and at the lowest price ."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}
Mary E. Dignam wrote to Alice Egan that the blanks would cost $6.60 a dozen to the artist. "Your best work is expected - not less than $60.00 will be asked per dozen in disposing of the set, proceeds to go to the artist, less 10%. Details of border of gold edge and W.A.A. stamp will be sent you, when you are ready for them. The pieces are be finished by May 18th [1897]."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}
The dinner service was not assembled as whole, inspected and approved until 7 July 1897.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}

==Plates==

All of the plates are painted on circular bone china blanks from [[Doulton &amp; Co.]] of Burslem, Staffordshire, England, with twenty-four plates of each type.
All but the desert plates have scalloped rims, and all but the game plates and dessert plates are bordered with a gilt scroll and trellis design.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
The soup plates each have a shallow bowl decorated with a historic Canadian landscape. 
The heraldic shield of the landscape's province is included on the border.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith of [[Hamilton, Ontario]], painted twelve of the soup plates, and Phoebe Amelia Watson of [[Doon, Ontario]], painted the other twelve.{{sfn|Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith, CMH}}{{sfn|Phoebe Amelia Watson, CMH}}

[[File:Dinner plate - Parliament Buildings and Ottawa River - Martha Logan.jpg|thumb|Dinner plate ''Parliament Buildings and Ottawa River'' by Martha Logan (1863-1937)]]
The fish plates illustrate  Canadian freshwater and saltwater fish, shells and seaweeds.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Lily Osman Adams of [[Toronto]] painted eighteen of the fish plates, with underwater designs, and Louise Couen, also of Toronto, painted the other six.{{sfn|ADAMS, Lily Osman, Concordia}}{{sfn|M. Louise Couen, CMH}}
The dinner plates show historic landscapes, and also include the heraldic shield of the province in the border design.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Margaret Irvine of Toronto and Martha Logan, originally from [[Hartford, Connecticut]], each painted twelve of the dinner plates.{{sfn|Margaret Irvine, CMH}}{{sfn|Martha Logan, CMH}}  Margaret Irvine was born in County Fermanagh, Ireland, sometime between 1847 and 1856.  She was the daughter of William Irvine and Jane Dignam, who came to Canada from County Fermanagh, Ireland, between 1846 and 1859.  The Irvine Family settled in London, Middlesex, Ontario, Canada.

The game plates each depict a different Canadian game bird, and the borders are decorated with plants from the bird's habitat. 
Small maple leaf motifs decorate the rims.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Alice Egan of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], was chosen to paint twelve of the game plates, and Elizabeth Whitney of St. Catherine's Street in [[Montreal]] to paint the other twelve.
They were asked to decide how they would divide the task. Alice wrote "I chose the ducks, or rather my father did.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}{{efn|
Alice Egan's father, Colonel T.J. Egan, was a respected taxidermist.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}} }} My father was afraid that other artists would paint the birds with deformed legs and wings, as they paid no attention to bird's joints.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
Her father was a hunter, and she used his [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] books as guides for her illustrations.{{sfn|Morrison|2014}}

The salad plates illustrate different Canadian ferns.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Justina A. Harrison of Toronto painted twelve salad plates and M. Roberts, of whom little is known other than that she lived in Toronto, painted the other twelve.{{sfn|Justina A. Harrison, CMH}}{{sfn|M. Roberts, CMH}}
The cheese plates show Canadian songbirds.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Hattie Proctor of Toronto painted twelve of the cheese plates and Elizabeth Whitney painted the other twelve. Whitney also painted twelve game plates.{{sfn|Hattie Proctor, CMH}}{{sfn|Elizabeth Whitney, CMH}}
The dessert plates show wild or cultivated Canadian fruits.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Alice M. Judd of Hamilton and Margaret McClung of [[St. Catharines]] each painted twelve of the dessert plates.{{sfn|Alice M. Judd, CMH}}{{sfn|Margaret McClung, CMH}}

==Coffee cups and saucers==
There are twenty-four coffee cups and saucers of bone china from Doulton &amp; Co., and twelve coffee cups and saucers of [[Limoges porcelain]].{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
The twenty-four Doulton coffee cups and saucers are lobed, as are their saucers, and have scroll handles.
The cups and saucers have gilts rims and handles, and are decorated with Canadian wildflowers.
The Limoges coffee cups have straight sides and ring handles, with circular saucers.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Twelve of the coffee cups and saucers were painted by Jane Bertram of Toronto, twelve by Juliet Howson of Toronto and twelve by Anna Lucy Kelley of [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|Jane Bertram, CMH}}{{sfn|Juliet Howson, CMH}}{{sfn|Anna Lucy Kelley, CMH}}

==Reception==
[[File:Dessert plate - Redcurrants - Painted by AM Judd.jpg|thumb|Dessert plate ''Redcurrants'' Alice M. Judd (died 1943)]]
In July 1897 the service was put on display in Toronto.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}
It was then exhibited in Montreal and [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}
The finished product was well received.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
It was called "a most valuable and interesting work on a large scale, accomplished by the most representative talent in the Dominion ... it is hoped that it will be accepted by the government and placed where it may be seen and studied and preserved to mark the first era in ceramics in Canada."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}
However, the government was unwilling to pay the asking price of CDN$1,000.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}

Mary Dignam and [[Lady Edgar]], wife of the speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, asked some members of the Senate and House of Commons for help. 
They arranged for the service to be bought at the artists' prices by private subscriptions from members of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.
On 13 June 1898 the service was formally presented by the members to [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] after the end of the term of her husband as Governor General.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}
In accepting the gift, Lady Aberdeen made an eloquent speech that ended,{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}

{{quote|These painted scenes will remind us of many voices from prairie, lake and river which will haunt us in our home, but there will be an undertone of deeper voices which will speak of human love and friendships and these voices will form a choir invisible and will speak to us in the truest music of Canada.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}}}

The service was shipped to Scotland and placed on display in [[Haddo House]], home of the Countess and Earl of Aberdeen.

This is still its home, although the house and the ceramic display are now the property of the [[National Trust for Scotland]].{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}

{{Classicism}}
'''Classicism''', in the [[The Arts|arts]], refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, [[classical antiquity]] in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained: of the ''[[Discobolus]]'' [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] observed, "if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of [[classic]] art. A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:242&lt;/ref&gt; Classicism, as Clark noted, implies a canon of widely accepted ideal forms, whether in the [[Western canon]] that he was examining in ''The Nude'' (1956), or the literary [[Chinese classics]] or [[Chinese art]], where the revival of classic styles is also a recurring feature.

Classicism is a force which is often present in post-medieval European and European influenced traditions; however, some periods felt themselves more connected to the classical ideals than others, particularly the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Kerry|date=September 2011|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE Review|jstor=41240671|journal=Church History|volume=80|pages=691–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Neoclassicism]] was an important movement in the visual arts.

==General term==

Classicism is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on [[society]]. It was particularly expressed in the [[Neoclassicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=James William|date=1969|title=What Was Neo-Classicism?|jstor=175167|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=9|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Classicism is a recurrent tendency in the [[Late Antique]] period, and had a major revival in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]]. There was another, more durable revival in the [[Italian renaissance]] when the fall of [[Byzantium]] and rising trade with the Islamic cultures brought a flood of knowledge about, and from, the antiquity of [[Europe]]. Until that time, the identification with antiquity had been seen as a continuous history of [[Christendom]] from the conversion of Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]]. [[Renaissance]] classicism introduced a host of elements into European culture, including the application of mathematics and [[empiricism]] into art, [[humanism]], literary and depictive [[realism (arts)|realism]], and [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]]. Importantly it also introduced [[Polytheism]], or "[[paganism]]", and the juxtaposition of ancient and modern.

The classicism of the Renaissance led to, and gave way to, a different sense of what was "classical" in the 16th and 17th centuries. In this period, classicism took on more overtly structural overtones of orderliness, predictability, the use of geometry and grids, the importance of rigorous discipline and pedagogy, as well as the formation of schools of art and music. The court of Louis XIV was seen as the center of this form of classicism, with its references to the gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] as a symbolic prop for absolutism, its adherence to axiomatic and deductive reasoning, and its love of order and predictability.

This period sought the revival of classical art forms, including Greek drama and music. [[Opera]], in its modern European form, had its roots in attempts to recreate the combination of singing and dancing with theatre thought to be the Greek norm. Examples of this appeal to classicism included [[Dante]], Petrarch, and Shakespeare in [[poetry]] and [[theatre]]. Tudor drama, in particular, modeled itself after classical ideals and divided works into [[Tragedy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakogianni|first=Anastasia|date=2012|title=Theatre of the Condemned. Classical Tragedy on Greek Prison Islands by [[Gonda Van Steen|G. VAN STEEN]]|jstor=41722362|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=132|pages=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comedy]]. Studying [[Ancient Greek]] became regarded as essential for a well-rounded education in the [[liberal arts]].

The Renaissance also explicitly returned to architectural models and techniques associated with Greek and Roman antiquity, including the [[golden rectangle]] as a key proportion for buildings, the classical orders of [[columns]], as well as a host of ornament and detail associated with Greek and Roman architecture. They also began reviving plastic arts such as [[bronze casting]] for sculpture, and used the classical naturalism as the foundation of [[drawing]], [[painting]] and sculpture.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] identified itself with a vision of antiquity which, while continuous with the classicism of the previous century, was shaken by the [[physics]] of Sir [[Isaac Newton]], the improvements in machinery and measurement, and a sense of liberation which they saw as being present in the Greek civilization, particularly in its struggles against the Persian Empire. The ornate, organic, and complexly integrated forms of the [[baroque]] were to give way to a series of movements that regarded themselves expressly as "classical" or "[[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]]", or would rapidly be labelled as such. For example, the painting of [[Jacques-Louis David]] was seen as an attempt to return to formal balance, clarity, manliness, and vigor in art.

The 19th century saw the classical age as being the precursor of academicism, including such movements as [[uniformitarianism]] in the sciences, and the creation of rigorous categories in artistic fields. Various movements of the romantic period saw themselves as classical revolts against a prevailing trend of emotionalism and irregularity, for example the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1943|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE The Pre-Raphaelites|jstor=4301128|journal=Bulletin of the Fogg Art Museum|volume=10|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, classicism was old enough that previous classical movements received revivals; for example, the Renaissance was seen as a means to combine the organic medieval with the orderly classical. The 19th century continued or extended many classical programs in the sciences, most notably the Newtonian program to account for the movement of energy between bodies by means of exchange of mechanical and thermal energy.

The 20th century saw a number of changes in the arts and sciences. Classicism was used both by those who rejected, or saw as temporary, transfigurations in the political, scientific, and social world and by those who embraced the changes as a means to overthrow the perceived weight of the 19th century. Thus, both pre-20th century disciplines were labelled "classical" and modern movements in art which saw themselves as aligned with light, space, sparseness of texture, and formal coherence.

In the present day [[philosophy]] classicism is used as a term particularly in relation to [[Apollonian]] over [[Dionysian]] impulses in society and art; that is a preference for rationality, or at least rationally guided catharsis, over [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]].

==In the theatre==
[[File:Molière - Nicolas Mignard (1658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Molière]] in classical dress, by [[Nicolas Mignard]], 1658.]]
'''Classicism''' in the [[theatre]] was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theatre]], including the "[[Classical unities]]" of time, place and action, found in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' of [[Aristotle]].

* Unity of time referred to the need for the entire action of the play to take place in a fictional 24-hour period
* Unity of place meant that the action should unfold in a single location
* Unity of action meant that the play should be constructed around a single 'plot-line', such as a tragic love affair or a conflict between [[honour]] and [[duty]].

Examples of classicist playwrights are [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Molière]].  In the period of [[Romanticism]], [[Shakespeare]], who conformed to none of the classical rules, became the focus of French argument over them, in which the Romantics eventually triumphed; [[Victor Hugo]] was among the first French playwrights to break these conventions.

The influence of these French rules on playwrights in other nations is debatable.  In the English theatre, Restoration playwrights such as [[William Wycherly]] and [[William Congreve]] would have been familiar with them.  [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries did not follow this Classicist philosophy, in particular since they were not French and also because they wrote several decades prior to their establishment.  Those of Shakespeare's plays that seem to display the unities, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Robert B.|date=Spring 1999|title=Understanding "The Tempest"|jstor=20057542|journal=New Literary History|volume=30|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably indicate a familiarity with actual models from [[classical antiquity]].

==In architecture==
{{Main|Classical architecture|Outline of classical architecture}}
[[File:Villa Rotonda front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Rotonda]], [[Palladio]], 1591]]
Classicism in architecture developed during the [[Italian Renaissance]], notably in the writings and designs of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. It places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the  architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of [[Roman Architecture|Ancient Rome]], of which many examples remained.

Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[lintel]]s, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and [[aedicule]]s replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and then to France, Germany, England, Russia and elsewhere.

In the 16th century, [[Sebastiano Serlio]] helped codify the [[classical order]]s and [[Palladio]]'s legacy evolved into the long tradition of [[Palladian architecture]]. Building off of these influences, the 17th-century architects [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Christopher Wren]] firmly established classicism in England.

For the development of classicism from the mid-18th-century onwards, see [[Neoclassical architecture]].

==In the fine arts==
* ''For Greek art of the 5th century B.C.E., see [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|Classical art in ancient Greece]] and the [[Severe style]]''

[[Italian Renaissance painting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Michael|date=March 1978|title=Italian Renaissance Painting by John Hale|jstor=41372753|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|volume=126|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sculpture]] are marked by their renewal of classical forms, motifs and subjects. In the 15th century [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was important in theorizing many of the ideas for painting that came to a fully realised product with [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' during the [[High Renaissance]]. The themes continued largely unbroken into the 17th century, when artists such as [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Charles Le Brun]] represented of the more rigid classicism. Like Italian classicizing ideas in the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread through Europe in the mid to late 17th century.

Later classicism in painting and sculpture from the mid-18th and 19th centuries is generally referred to as [[Neoclassicism]].

[[File:Garfield Goose 1953 book at home in castle.jpg|thumb|250px|Filled-in child's coloring book, ''Garfield Goose'' (1953)]]

A '''coloring book''' (or '''colouring book''', or '''colouring page''') is a type of book containing [[line art]] to which people are intended to add color using [[crayon]]s, [[Pencil|colored pencil]]s, [[marker pen]]s, [[paint]] or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have [[Perforation|perforated edge]]s so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a [[Narrative|story]] line and so are intended to be left intact. Today many children's coloring books feature popular [[character (arts)|cartoon character]]s. They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as [[connect the dots]], [[maze]]s and other [[puzzle]]s. Some also incorporate the use of [[stickers]].

==History==
[[Image:The Little Folks Paint Book.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Little Folks Painting Book'', 1879]]
Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the "democratization of art" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist [[Joshua Reynolds]], and the works of Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and his student [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to benefit from [[art education]] as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2003/08/04/31263.html|title=Drawn to Art: Art Education and the American Experience, 1800–1950|year=2003|publisher=absolutearts.com|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McLoughlin Brothers]] are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced ''The Little Folks' Painting Book'', in collaboration with [[Kate Greenaway]]. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the [[Milton Bradley Company]].

Another pioneer in the genre was [[Richard F. Outcault]]. He authored ''Buster's Paint Book'' in 1907, featuring the character of [[Buster Brown]], which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts" /&gt; Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when [[crayon]]s came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored.&lt;ref name="PatJacobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loti.com/then_now/Coloring_Books.htm|last=Jacobs|first=Pat|title=Coloring Books|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational uses==

Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons.  For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringpagesonline.net/coloring-pages-online-a-helping-hand-for-parents-and-teachers/|title=A Helping Hand for Parents and Teachers|date=February 5, 2012|publisher=Coloring Pages Online|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorkid.net/benefits_of_coloring research]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in [[Guatemala]] to teach children about hieroglyphs and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] artist patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Perspectives of Children's Literature in Guatemala | jstor=344988 | journal=Hispania | first=Sue | last=Misheff |date=September 1994 | volume=77 | issue=3 | pages=524–531 | doi=10.2307/344988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about "the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1289/ehp.5203 | title=Nuclear Waste Transportation: Case Studies of Identifying Stakeholder Risk Information Needs |date=March 2003 | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=111 | issue=3 | pages=263–272 | last=Drew | first=Christina H. |author2=Deirdre A.

Faustman  | pmid=12611653 | pmc=1241381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in.

They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in [[Roger Burrows]]' ''Altair Designs''.

Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include ''The Anatomy Coloring Book'' and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by [[HarperCollins]] (1990s) and [[Benjamin Cummings]] (2000s).&lt;ref&gt;''The Anatomy Coloring Book'', Wynn Kapit and Lawrence M. Elson. HarperCollins, 1993, second revised and expanded edition, {{ISBN|0-06-455016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like math&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Vn3GLf-4YkEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=coloring+book&amp;ots=mWvrVhWoy2&amp;sig=MVSjMedFtE-tFSCApYpacxV-AYE#v=onepage&amp;q=coloring%20book&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794979900622]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include [[Dover Books]], [[Really Big Coloring Books]], [[Running Press]], and [[Malcolm Whyte|Troubador Press]].

==Health and therapeutic uses==
Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book "might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tonsil Season | first=Carolyn | jstor=3451768 | last=Harris | journal=The American Journal of Nursing | volume=61 | issue=1 |date=January 1961 | pages=91–92 | doi=10.2307/3451768}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of [[hand–eye coordination]], and they are used with [[Autism|autistic]] children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=McDonald |first2=A. |last2=Thomsen |first3=Y. |last3=Belessis |first4=A. |last4=Jaffe |date=June 2007 |title=292 CF and Me – a colouring book for children |journal=Journal of Cystic Fibrosis |volume=6 |issue=Suppl 1 |page=S71 |doi=10.1016/S1569-1993(07)60267-7 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199307602677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de-stress.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colouring books designed for adults topping bestseller lists (Books by illustrator Johanna Basford (Secret Garden and Enchanted Forest) created as a way to de-stress) |date= April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2015|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/04/06/colouring-books-designed-for-adults-topping-bestseller-lists.html|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political uses==
In 1962, cartoonist [[Mort Drucker]] teamed with humorist [[Paul Laikin]] in creating the ''[[John F. Kennedy]] Coloring Book'', a satirical introduction to Kennedy, his family and administration, told from the point of view of his daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]]. The book sold 2,500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

In 1968 the ''Black Panther Coloring Book'' began circulating in the United States; the book features black men and children killing [[List of slang terms for police officers#P|pigs dressed as police officers]].  It was argued to have been made not by the [[Black Panther Party]] but by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] program to discredit the organization, a claim which other sources dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators have alleged that the book was a piece of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[agitprop]].

The term and concept of the "coloring book" was adopted by the [[feminism|feminist]] artist [[Tee Corinne]] as a tool of female empowerment. Corinne made pencil sketches of female genitalia, which she then inked and printed on card stock. She published a collection of them in 1975 as ''The Cunt Coloring Book.''
{{quote|No other name seemed really to fit, although the word "cunt" was not one with which I was particularly comfortable. The alliteration, though, was nice.

In August 2011, American publisher Really Big Coloring Books released ''We Shall Never Forget: The Kids Book of Freedom'' detailing specific drawings in the accounting of [[SEAL Team 6]] shooting [[Osama bin Laden]] in his home. The book was criticized by some for portraying Muslims in a negative manner.

==Fine art==
Photographer Jno Cook produced line drawings based on [[Robert Frank]]'s ''[[The Americans (photography)|The Americans]]'', and in 1983 published them in a limited edition as ''The Robert Frank Coloring Book''. In 1994, the [[National Gallery of Art]] used the images as [[party favor]]s for writers working on the catalog for a retrospective of Frank's work.&lt;ref name="jnocook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Jno|title=The Robert Frank Coloring Book|url=http://jnocook.net/frank/rfcolor1.htm|website=jnocook.net|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are a form of adult [[therapy]] that have seen a growth in popularity in the 2010s. They reportedly bring people a sense of their [[childhood]],&lt;ref name="MedicalDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovey|first1=Dana|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books: How This Childhood Pastime Helps Adults Relieve Stress|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=Medical Daily|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help with developing fine motor skills and vision, reducing anxiety and creating focus, and relieving stress and anxiety in a manner similar to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/health/adult-coloring-books-popularity-mental-health/index.html|title=Why adult coloring books are good for you|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating on coloring may facilitate the replacement of negative thoughts and images with pleasant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books|website=Medical Daily|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books can be used in daily activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Paper notebook with adult coloring pages|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are also a way to get away from technology, which some regard as beneficial to people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bratskeir|first1=Kate|title=Unplug From Technology: 19 Ways To Spend Time Off The Grid|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/unplug-from-technology_n_2762116.html|accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com |date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used by people who are uncomfortable with more creatively expressive forms of art.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

While coloring books for adults were popular in the early 1960s, those were satirical works rather than the therapeutic works that define the adult coloring book form today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/126580/radical-history-1960s-adult-coloring-books|title=The Radical History of 1960s Adult Coloring Books|publisher=''The New Republic''|date=December 28, 2015|first=Laura|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful adult coloring books were published in 2012 and 2013,&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; and began increasing in popularity in 2015.

By 2016, [[Faber-Castell]], a worldwide color pencil supplier, was reported to have trouble keeping up with demand for their products due to the craze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=All the adults colouring is leading to huge sales for pencil companies|url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/10/colouring-trend/#OD9Gr_TPMgqb|website=Mashable|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Blue Star Coloring]] sold over a million titles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/02/10/books-how-adult-coloring-books-became-popular|title=How adult coloring books became a million-dollar trend|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Author [[Susan Jacoby]] has criticized adult coloring books, along with the popularity among adults of [[young adult fiction]], as "an artifact of a broader cultural shift. And that cultural shift is a bad thing.”&lt;ref name="newyorkerraphael"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raphael|first1=Adrienne|title=Why Adults Are Buying Coloring Books (for Themselves)|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-adults-are-buying-coloring-books-for-themselves|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the [[Great Recession]] has contributed to this shift, as adults unable to find employment have moved home to live with their parents. New York City [[futurist]] and blogger Dominic Bulsuto describes adult coloring book fans as "stuck in The Shallows, mindfully coloring books to counter the existential angst of living in a digital society." He goes on to say that "...the endless Internet parade of silly cat photos, infantile comments and adolescent [[Internet meme|meme]]s has dumbed us down." However, Bulsuto ultimately sees the trend as a good thing, noting that adults are increasingly buying books they want to buy, rather than books they are supposed to buy.&lt;ref name=Coloringpost/&gt;

==Coloring book software==
Coloring books can also be found digitally in the form of coloring book websites and applications. Coloring book software often has features such as color mixing, [[Flood Fill|flood filling]], and paintbrush tools that allow for more accurate and detailed drawings than regular coloring books.

[[File:Dashain Tika 02.JPG|thumb|Senior offering ''Dashain Tika'' on great Nepali [[Hindu]] festival at a traditional home.]]
The '''culture of [[Nepal]]''' is intertwined with the culture of the broader [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Tibet]]. The [[cultural heritage]] of [[Nepal]] has evolved over the centuries. This multi-dimensional heritage bounds the diversities of Nepal's [[ethnic]], [[tribal]], and [[social groups]], and it expresses in [[music]] and [[dance]]; [[art]] and [[craft]]; [[folklore]] and [[Folklore|folktales]]; [[languages]] and [[literature]]; [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]; [[festivals]] and [[Party|celebration]]; [[foods]] and [[drinks]]. Its culture is mostly influenced by [[Indian culture]] and [[Tibetan culture]].

==Dance and music==
[[File:Nepali culture.JPG|thumb|Nepali traditional Pahadi dress used for dance]]
[[Legend]]s state that [[dances]] in this country originated in the abode of Lord Shiva — the [[Himalayas]], where he performed the [[tandava]] dance. This indicates that dance traditions of Nepal are very ancient and unique. With altitudes and ethnicity, the dances of Nepal slightly change in style as well as in the [[costumes]]. The Dishka, a dance performed at weddings, includes intricate footwork and arm movements. Accompanying music and musical instruments change in tune with the themes, which revolve around topics like harvesting of crops, marriage rites, war stories, a lonely girl’s yearning for her love, and several other themes and stories from everyday life in the villages. The famous Tharu stick dances, and the crazy peacock dance are two highlights, but there are plenty of other surprises. Expect to be invited to join in the dancing, as the evening reaches its climax.

==Languages==
As per the 2011 census, 123 languages are spoken in Nepal. Nepal's linguistic heritage has evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (44.6%), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (11.7%), [[Bhojpuri]](6%), [[Tharu language|Tharu]] (5.8%), [[Tamang]] (5.1%), [[Nepal Bhasa (language)|Nepal Bhasa]] (3.2%), [[Magar language|Magar]] (3%) and [[Bajjika]] (3%) [[Kirat]]-[[Sunuwar]], [[Limbu]], [[Rai languages|Rai]], [[Gurung]], .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |title=Major highlights |work= |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics |year=2013 |page=4 |accessdate=1 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nepali language|Nepali]], written in [[Devanagari]] script, is the official national language and serves as ''lingua franca'' among Nepalese ethno-linguistic groups. Extinct languages of Nepal include [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]], MaWalinga and [[Waling]]

'''Religions and philosophy of Nepal'''

[[File:A Buddhist Monastery Nepal.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A [[Buddhist monastery]] in southern Nepal.]]
The 2001 [[census]] identified 80.6% of the population being [[Hinduism|Hindu]]. [[Buddhism]] was practiced by about 11% of the population (although many people labelled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a syncretic blend of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and/or [[animist]] traditions). About 3.2% practice [[Islam]] and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous [[Kirant]] religion. [[Christianity]] is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.

Hindu and Buddhist traditions in Nepal go back more than two [[millennia]]. In [[Lumbini]], Buddha was born, and [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath temple]], Kathmandu, is an old and famous [[Shiva|Shiva temple]] of Hindus. Nepal has several other [[temples]] and Buddhist [[monasteries]], as well as places of worship of other religious groups. Traditionally, Nepalese [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thoughts are ingrained with the Hindu and Buddhist philosophical ethos and traditions, which include elements of [[Shaivaites|Kashmir Shaivism]], Nyingma school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], works of Karmacharyas of Bhaktapur, and tantric traditions. [[Tantra|Tantric]] traditions are deep rooted in Nepal, including the practice of animal sacrifices. Five types of animals, always male, are considered acceptable for sacrifice: [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[goats]], [[sheep]], [[chickens]], and [[ducks]]. Cows are very sacred animals and are never considered acceptable for sacrifice.

==Festivals and celebrations==
[[File:Dashai.jpg|thumb|Senior offering ''Dashain Tika'' to junior]]
[[File:Messe-09.JPG|thumb|right|Costumed Hindu girls of Kathmandu during festival time in Nepal]]
Several of the [[List of festivals in Nepal|festivals of Nepal]] last from one to several days. As a predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese festivals are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their roots in [[Hinduism]] as 82% of the population of the country is Hindu. [[Buddhism]], the second-largest religion of the nation which accounts for 9% of the population, has influenced the cultural festivals of Nepal. [[Dashain]] or [[Dusshera]] is the longest and the most important festival of Nepal. Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid-October, right after the end of the [[Monsoon|monsoon season]]. It is "a day of Victory over Demons". The [[Newar]]s celebrate the festival as [[Mohani]]. [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] or [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Saraswati Puja]], [[Rakshabandhan]], [[Bhai Dooj]], [[Janmashtami]], [[Kali Puja]], Gai Jatra, Nag Panchami, [[Teej]], [[Chhath]], [[Kartik Poornima]], [[Maghe Sankranti]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Maha Shivratri]] and [[Chhechu]] are other widely celebrated important festivals of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar [[Nepal Sambat]] occurs in November. Several Jatras take place throughout the year and public holidays are declared in some regions.

Other important festivals include [[Buddha Purnima]] (the celebration of the birth of Buddha)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL= http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/buddha-purnima|title=Buddha jayanti|publisher=Weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shivaratri|Maha Shivaratri]] (a festival of [[Shive|Lord Shiva]]) and during [[Maha Shivaratri]] festivities, some people consume excessive [[drinks]]  and smoke [[charas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/maha-shivaratri|title=Mahashivaratri|publisher=weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], mostly located at higher altitudes and in the [[Mount Everest]] region, celebrate ''Mani Rimdu'', for ''the good of the world''.

Most festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods are consumed during festivals and on special occasions.

The [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan ceremony]] is the ritualized presentation of five food items (boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine) to a person which is done to bring good fortune as per [[Tantra|Tantric]] tradition.

==Background==
The '''East Village''', sometimes called the "East Village Arts District," is the name of a neighborhood in [[Long Beach, California]], within eastern  [[Downtown Long Beach, Long Beach, California|Downtown Long Beach]].  The borders of the East Village are not strictly defined, but the area is centered in the southeast portion of downtown, roughly between Long Beach Boulevard on the west and Alamitos Avenue on the east, and Ocean Boulevard on the south to 10th Street on the north.

==Demographics==
The East Village is a mix of many different housing types, including high-rise condos, artist lofts and small [[Arts and Crafts movement|craftsman cottages]]. It serves as the home to individuals with differing cultures, income levels, and professions. 

==Setting==
The neighborhood has many independent stores selling everything from designer denim and specialty sneakers to used books and mid-century furniture. There are coffee shops, juice bars, and restaurants featuring selections from crepes and sushi to chicken n' waffles.

==Arts District==
The East Village is also the city's [[arts district]], with most of the independent shops, restaurants and [[art gallery|galleries]] exhibiting work by Long Beach and Southern Californian artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://lbpost.com/news/2000000895-lbt-makes-major-changes-routes-altered-cleaner-buses&lt;/ref&gt;
The East Village Arts District is home to the ''Second Saturday Art Walk'' [http://artwalklb.com/] which occurs every month. This event features art receptions and special events in the shop and galleries of the District. The District is also home to ''Tour des Artistes'', an annual street festival event in June which features visual artists in every discipline, as well as performing artists ranging from singer-songwriters to Shakespeare.
The District hosts ''Soundwalk'' [http://www.soundwalk.org], a unique sound art festival, which began in 2004. ''Soundwalk'' is a series of site-specific sound installations and sound art performances which attracts renowned sound artists from around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">The '''film industry in Connecticut''', which previously consisted of small production companies making commercials, industrial films and some television programs, began growing dramatically as a state tax credit went into effect in 2006, attracting numerous filmmakers to shoot on location in the state. 

The state's film tax-incentive program went into effect July 1, 2006 and immediately attracted film companies (many of them based in [[New York, New York]]) to shooting locations. Starting in August 2006, ''In Bloom'' (released in 2007 as ''[[The Life Before Her Eyes]]'') became the first major, full-length film since "The Ice Storm" to be shot entirely in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/local/scn-sa-film1aug19,0,5884691,print.story "Thurman film first to receive state tax credits"]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, article by Donna Porstner, ''The Advocate'' of Stamford, August 19, 2006, accessed August 20, 2006. The film was also shot at Norwalk Community College in August.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax law allows producers who spend in excess of $50,000 in the state to receive up to 30 percent tax credits.&lt;ref name=mnnyt&gt;Nash, Margo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/03topicct.html "Hollywood Finds a Match Made in Connecticut"], article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', Connecticut section, June 3, 2007, accessed April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"Connecticut is absolutely a prime filming location now due to the tax incentive program which makes the state very appealing", according to Ellen Woolf, project manager with the Connecticut Commission on Culture &amp; Tourism, Film Division. Before the tax break went into effect, the state saw between $3 million and $6 million a year in filmmaking revenue. In 2007, Woolf estimated, "we'll probably be hitting the $300 million mark".&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Maggie and Shea, Brian, "Hollywood comes to Wilton: Old Dogs to shoot in town tomorrow", article in ''Wilton Bulletin'', Wilton, Connecticut, August 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article, the state is among the "top five" best state tax incentive programs in the country, although the evaluation was said to be "far from an exact science". The article described the state's film presence over the previous two years as having "gone from nonentity to major player in the incentive game, and has offered further proof that film-related legislation has the ability to give local economies an immediate boost." It said there were seven "high-profile" features shooting in the state as of early 2008, including [[Andrew Jarecki]]'s ''[[All Good Things (film)|All Good Things]]'' with [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[P. J. Hogan]]'s "[[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)|Confessions of a Shopaholic]]" and [[Sam Mendes]]' ''[[Away We Go|Farlanders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Matthew, [http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117985361&amp;categoryid=-1 "Rebates are blooming in these states: The top five film incentive packages in the U.S."], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', May 8, 2008, retrieved June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}[[Image:Agape feast 05.jpg|thumb|''Fractio panis'', in the [[Catacombs of Rome]]]]
'''''Fractio Panis''''' (English: ''Breaking of Bread'') is the name given to a [[fresco]] in the Greek Chapel (''Capella Greca'') in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], situated on the [[Via Salaria]] Nova in [[Rome]].  The fresco depicts seven persons at a table, six men and a woman.  Like the whole of the decorations of the chapel, the fresco dates from the first half of the 2nd century. The painting is found upon the face of the arch immediately over the altar tomb, upon which the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] was performed.

==Discovery==
By chance this particular fresco, having been covered by a thick crust of [[stalactite]]s, escaped the notice of the early explorers of the catacombs. In 1893, [[Jesuit]] art historian Joseph Wilpert, one of a band of young scholars who looked upon [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi|De Rossi]] as their master, arrived at the conclusion that the roof and arches of this chapel were decorated with frescoes. Chemical reagents were used to remove the crust which covered the surface, and by the patient care of Wilpert this delicate operation was attended with complete success.  De Rossi described it as "the pearl of Catacomb discoveries".  Wilpert published a monograph in 1895 giving a full account of this discovery under the title ''Fractio Panis, die alteste Darstellung der eucharistischen Opfers'' (Freiburg in Breisgau).  This was translated into French the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|volume=2
|issue=3
|date=July 1898

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains a collection of very carefully executed [[photogravure]]s of the frescoes in the ''Capella Greca''.

The scene represented is a picture of seven persons at a table, six men and a woman. It seems clear that six of these are reclining as the ancients reclined at their meals. But the seventh personage, a bearded and impressive figure, sits somewhat apart at the extremity of the table. His head is thrown back, he has a small loaf or cake in his hands, and his arms stretched out in front of him show that he is breaking it. Upon the table immediately before him is a two-handled cup. Further along the table there are two large plates, one containing two fishes, the other five loaves. At each extremity of the picture upon either side we notice baskets filled with loaves—four baskets at one end, three at the other.

==Interpretation==
The phrase "fractio panis" (Greek: ''klasis tou artou'') and its variants is not found in pagan literature but recurs frequently in early Christian literature, indicating particular Christian usage;&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Barry M., ''Fractio Panis: A History of the Breaking of Bread in the Roman Rite'', Studia Anselmiana 151/Analecta Liturgica 29, Rome: Pontificio Ateneo S. Anselmo [Sankt Ottilien: EOS], 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-8306-7426-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only is the "blessing and breaking" of the bread mentioned in each of the four accounts of the Last Supper, but repeatedly also in the other Apostolic writings. For example, in [[First Letter to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], 10:16, "The cup of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord?" So again in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], 2:42, "And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers" (cf. Acts, 2:46). And particularly Acts, 2:7, "And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread", where this practice is closely associated with the observance of Sunday. (Cf. also the disciples at [[Emmaus]] on [[Easter Day]]--Luke 24:30-35, and Acts, 27:35). 

Similar prominence is given to this conception in other sub-Apostolic writings, notably in the [[Didache]] or "Teaching of the Apostles" (xiv, I), where it is associated with the observance of the Sunday as well as with the explicit mention of Sacrifice and with confession. "And on the Lord's day come together and break bread and give thanks, having first confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure." Further, in ch. xi of the same early treatise the consecrated Host is clearly designated by the term ''klasma'', i.e. "broken bread". It seems natural than that, in the earliest form of the liturgy, the breaking of the bread should have been regarded as the climax of the ritual employed. This Eucharistic significance of the picture is borne out by all the accessories. The loaves and the fishes upon the table point directly to the [[Feeding the multitude]] twice performed by [[Jesus Christ]]. The association of this miracle with the Eucharist is familiar, not only in other archaeological monuments, but also in early Christian literature.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Origen]], "In Matt.", x, 25 (P.G. XIII, 902), and [[Ambrose]], "De Virgin.", I, 3 (P.L. , XVI, 219).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the symbolic significance of the fish and the anagram [[ichthys]], both the [[Inscription of Abercius]] of the close of the 2nd century and that of [[Diocese of Autun|Autun]] a little later, as well as the large number of allusions in early Christian literature, make it clear that Christ was indicated by this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Mowat in the "Atti del Congresso Internnaz. d'Archeol. Crist.", Rome, 1902, pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the Abercius inscription clearly conveys that this "great fish" was to be the permanent food of the soul. We may also note that the one female fixture among the guests depicted in the ''Fractio Panis'' fresco is veiled, which is not the case with the female figures represented in those other banqueting scenes found in the catacombs and usually interpreted as symbolic of the joys of heaven.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

The fresco is neither entirely realistic or entirely symbolical. That the president (''proestos'') of the [[Synaxis]] (assembly) should break the bread seated, is probably not to be understood as implying that the bishops in the early Church were in fact seated when they offered the liturgy any more than the attitude of the guests implies that the early Christians reclined on couches when they assisted at Eucharist. On the other hand, the action of the breaking of the bread is clearly realistic. A further indication of the Eucharistic significance of the fresco is afforded by the fact that in the fresco next to it in the same chamber is depicted the [[Binding of Isaac]]. On the other side is a representation of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lions' den, to which Wilpert also attaches a Eucharistic significance on account of the supernatural feeding of Daniel through the intervention of the prophet [[Habakkuk]] (Daniel, 14:36).

Some art historians, for instance Dorothy Irvin, have viewed the fresco as archaeological evidence that women presided over the Eucharist in the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Hannah Wilke was born on March 7, 1940 in [[New York City]] to [[Judaism|Jewish]] parents; her grandparents were Eastern European immigrants. In 1962, she received a Bachelor of Fine Art and a Bachelor of Science in Education from the [[Tyler School of Art]], [[Temple University]], Philadelphia. She taught art in several high schools and joined the faculty of the [[School of Visual Arts]], New York, where she taught sculpture and ceramics from 1974–1991.&lt;ref name="artinamerica-97"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Art in America]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n2_v85/ai_19114074 |date=February 1997 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=92–93 |last=Princenthal |first=Nancy |accessdate=2007-07-07 |title=Mirror of Venus — photography, videos and performance art, Hannah Wilke, Ronald Feldman Gallery, New York, New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216021606/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n2_v85/ai_19114074 |archivedate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt; From 1969 to 1977, Wilke was in a relationship with the American Pop artist, [[Claes Oldenburg]], and they lived, worked and traveled together during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Marsie Scharlatt, "Hannah in California," in ''Hannah Wilke: Selected Work, 1963-1992'', Hannah Wilke Collection &amp; Archive, Los Angeles, and SolwayJones, Los Angeles, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Fitzpatrick, "Making Myself into a Monument," ''Gestures'', Neuberger Museum of Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Princenthal, ''Hannah Wilke'', Prestel Publishing, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilke's work was exhibited&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id10.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528031221/http://www.hannahwilke.com/id10.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |title=Hannah Wilke: Biography, Exhibitions, Awards, HWCALA |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationally and internationally throughout her life and continues to be shown posthumously.&lt;ref name="exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id25.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125204052/http://www.hannahwilke.com/id25.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2011 |title=EXHIBITIONS |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solo exhibitions of her work were first shown in New York and Los Angeles in 1972. Her first full museum exhibition was held at the [[University of California, Irvine]], in 1976, and her first retrospective at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1989. Posthumous retrospectives were shown in Copenhagen, Helsinki, and Malmo, Sweden in 2000 and at the [[Neuberger Museum of Art]] from 2008 to 2009. Since her death, Wilke's work has been shown in solo gallery shows, group exhibitions, and several surveys of women's art, including WACK! (www.moca.org) and Elles (www.pompidou.fr).

===Early work===

Wilke first gained renown with her "[[vulval]]" [[terra-cotta]] sculptures in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="grrrls"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pin-up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture  |last = Buszek |first= Maria Elena |publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |isbn=0-8223-3746-0 |year=2006 |pages=291–294 |chapter = Our Bodies/Ourselves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sculptures, first exhibited in New York in the late 1960s, are often mentioned as some of the first explicit [[vaginal]] imagery arising from the [[women's liberation movement]],&lt;ref name="grrrls" /&gt; and they became her signature form which she made in various media, colors and sizes, including large floor installations, throughout her life.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Fitzpatrick, ''Gestures'', Neuberger Museum of Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of her mediums included clay, chewing gum, kneaded erasers, laundry lint and latex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The use of unconventional materials is typical of feminist art, because traditionally women did not have access to art supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schapiro|first=Miriam|year=1977–78|title=Waste Not Want Not|url=|journal=Heresies 1|volume=no. 4|pages=153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sculptures were an innovative example of eroticism using a style that combined [[Postminimalism|post-minimalism]] and feminist aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middleman|first=Rachel|year=2013|title=Rethinking Vaginal Iconology with Hannah Wilke's Sculpture|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/1710658672/984B0B3843BF4D87PQ/3?accountid=14171|journal=Art Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consummate draftswoman, Wilke created numerous drawings, beginning in the early 1960s and throughout her life. In a review of Wilke's drawings at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in 2010, Thomas Micchelli writes in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'': "at her core, she was a maker of things ... an artist whose sensuality and humor are matched by her formal acumen and tactile rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Micchelli|first=Thomas|title=HANNAH WILKE Early Drawings|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/10/artseen/hannah-wilke-early-drawings}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She performed live and videotaped performance art, beginning in 1974 with ''Hannah Wilke Super-t-Art'', a live performance at the Kitchen, New York, which she also made into an iconic photographic work. The performance art Wilke did evokes the likes of [[Simone Forti]], [[Trisha Brown]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]]. The sculptural art Wilke created, with its unconventional materials and feminist narratives also relates to the likes of [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Alina Szapocznikow]] and [[Niki de Saint Phalle|Niki de St Phalle]].

===Body art===
In 1974, Wilke began work on her photographic [[body art]] piece ''S.O.S — Starification Object Series'' in which she merged her minimalist sculpture and her own body by creating tiny vulval sculptures out of [[chewing gum]] and sticking them to herself.&lt;ref name="grrrls"/&gt;  She then had herself photographed in various [[pin-up]] poses, providing a juxtaposition of glamour and something resembling [[tribal scarification]].&lt;ref name="grrrls"/&gt; Wilke has related the scarring on her body to an awareness of the [[Holocaust]]. These poses exaggerate and satirize American cultural values of feminine beauty and fashion and also hint at an interest in ceremonial scarification.&lt;ref name="wacks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wacks|first=Debra|last2=Goldman|first2=Saundra|last3=Fischer|first3=Alfred M.|last4=Cottingham|first4=Laura|date=Summer 1999|title=Naked Truths: Hannah Wilke in Copenhagen|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|publisher=College Art Association|volume=58|issue=2|pages=104–106|doi=10.2307/777953|jstor=777953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 50 self-portraits were originally created as a game, "S.O.S.Starificaion Object Series: An Adult Game of Mastication", 1974–75, which Wilke made into an installation that is now in the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris. She also performed this piece publicly in Paris in 1975, having audience members chew the gum for her before she sculpted them and placed them on papers that she hung on the wall.&lt;ref name="wacks"/&gt; Wilke also used colored chewing gum as a medium for individual sculptures, using multiple pieces of gum to create a complex layering representing the vulva.&lt;ref name="extra"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly|X-TRA]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |title=Hannah Wilke |last=Dick |first=Leslie |url=http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=161 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721171909/http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=161 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke coined the term "performalist self-portraits" to credit photographers who assisted her, including her father (''First Performalist Self-Portrait'', 1942–77) and her sister, Marsie (Butter) 
Scharlatt (''Arlene Hannah Butter and Cover of Appearances'', 1954–77). The title of Wilke's photographic and performance work, ''So Help Me Hannah'', 1979, was taken from a vernacular phrase from the 1930s and '40s and has been interpreted as playing off of the [[Jewish mother stereotype]] and referencing Wilke's relationship with her mother.&lt;ref name="artinamerica-97"/&gt;

Besides ''Hannah Wilke Super-t-Art'', 1974, other well-known performances in which Wilke used her body include ''Gestures'', 1974; ''Hello Boys'', 1975; ''Intercourse with ... '' (audio installation) 1974–1976; ''Intercourse with ... '' (video) 1976; and ''Hannah Wilke Through the Large Glass'' performed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in 1977.

===Death and ''Intra-Venus''===

Hannah Wilke died in 1993 from [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Her last work, ''Intra-Venus'' (1992–1993), is a posthumously published photographic record of her physical transformation and deterioration resulting from [[chemotherapy]] and bone marrow transplant.&lt;ref name="tierny-review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Hanne|date=January 1996|title=Hannah Wilke: The Intra-Venus Photographs|journal=[[Performing Arts Journal]]|volume=18|issue=1|pages=44–49|jstor=3245813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The photographs, which were taken by her husband Donald Goddard whom she had lived with since 1982 and married in 1992 shortly before her death, confront the viewer with personal images of Wilke progressing from midlife happiness to bald, damaged, and resigned.&lt;ref name="tierny-review"/&gt; ''Intra-Venus'' mirrors her photo diptych ''Portrait of the Artist with Her Mother, Selma Butter'', 1978–82, which portrayed her mother's struggles with cancer and "having literally incorporated her mother, illness and all."&lt;ref name="jones-189"&gt;{{cite book|title = Body Art/Performing the Subject |last = Jones |first = Amelia |authorlink = Amelia Jones |chapter = The Rhetoric of the Pose: Hannah Wilke |publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] |location = [[Minneapolis]] |year=1998 |isbn = 0-8166-2773-8 |page = 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Intra-Venus'' was exhibited and published posthumously partially in response to Wilke's feelings that clinical procedures hide patients as if dying was a "personal shame".&lt;ref name="artinamerica-94"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v82/ai_15406252 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |title=Hannah Wilke at Ronald Feldman — New York, New York — Review of Exhibitions |last=Vine |first=Richard |journal=[[Art in America]] |date=May 1994 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028104819/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v82/ai_15406252 |archivedate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intra Venus works also include watercolor Face and Hand drawings, ''Brushstrokes,'' a series of drawings made
from her own hair and the ''Intra Venus Tapes'', a 16-channel videotape installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-wilke-hannah-artworks.htm|title=Hannah Wilke Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pose and narcissism==
In her work, Hannah Wilke often features herself as a posing glamour model. Her use of self in photography and [[performance art]], however, has been interpreted as a celebration and validation of Self, Women, the Feminine, and Feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Frueh, "Hannah Wilke," in ''Hannah Wilke: A Retrospective'', University of Missouri Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Raven,"The Eternal Hannah Wilke," in ''Hannah Wilke: Selected Works, 1963-1992'', Hannah Wilke Collection &amp; Archive, Los Angeles and SolwayJones, Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has also been described as an artistic deconstruction of cultural modes of female vanity, [[narcissism]] and beauty.&lt;ref name="toepfer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toepfer|first=Karl|date=September 1996|title=Nudity and Textuality in Postmodern Performance|journal=[[Performing Arts Journal]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=82–83|jstor=3245676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-152"&gt;Jones (1998), pp.151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke referred to herself as a feminist artist from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wooster|first=Ann-Sargent|title=Hannah Wilke: Whose Image is it anyway|newspaper=High Performance|date=Fall 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art critic]] Ann-Sargent Wooster said that Wilke's identification with the feminist movement was confusing because of her beauty — her self-portraitures looked more like a Playboy centerfold than the typical feminist nudes.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"/&gt; According to Wooster,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem Wilke faced in being taken seriously is that she was conventionally beautiful and her beauty and self-absorbed narcissism distracted you from her reversal of the voyeurism inherent in women as sex objects. In her photographs of herself as a goddess, a living incarnation of great works of art or as a pin-up, she wrested the means of production of the female image from male hands and put them in her own.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If critics found Wilke's beauty an impediment to understanding her work, this changed in the early 1990s when Wilke began documenting the decay of her body ravaged by lymphoma. Wilke's use of self-portraiture has been explored in detail in writing about her last photographic series, ''Intra Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Jones, "Hannah Wilke's Feminist Narcissism," ''Intra Venus'', Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke once answered the critics who commented on her body being too beautiful for her work by saying "People give me this bullshit of, 'What would you have done if you weren't so gorgeous?' What difference does it make? ... Gorgeous people die as do the stereotypical 'ugly.' Everybody dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feldmangallery.com/media/pdfs/wilke%20in%20markszine03.pdf|title=Everybody Dies ... Even the Gorgeous: Resurrecting the Work of Hannah Wilke|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705102922/http://www.feldmangallery.com/media/pdfs/wilke%20in%20markszine03.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Critical recognition==
During her lifetime, Wilke was widely exhibited, and although controversial, received critical praise. However, until recently, museums were hesitant to acquire work by women artists who, including Wilke, engaged in protests decrying their lack of inclusion during the feminist movement of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Princenthal, ''Hannah Wilke'', Prestel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilke's work, with its confrontational use of female sexuality and the fact that it does not fit into a distinct genre or style, was in very few permanent collections when she was alive. Since her death, Wilke's work has been acquired into the permanent collections of [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], and in European museums such as the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hannah Wilke Art in Selected Public Collections|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''isometry''' (or '''[[congruence (geometry)|congruence]]''', or '''congruent transformation''') is a [[distance]]-preserving transformation between [[metric spaces]], usually assumed to be [[Bijection|bijective]].&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=29}} &lt;p&gt;"We shall find it convenient to use the word ''transformation'' in the special sense of a one-to-one correspondence &lt;math&gt; P \to P'&lt;/math&gt; among all points in the plane (or in space), that is, a rule for associating pairs of points, with the understanding that each pair has a first member {{mvar|P}} and a second member {{mvar|P'}} and that every point occurs as the first member of just one pair and also as the second member of just one pair...&lt;p&gt;In particular, an ''isometry'' (or "congruent transformation," or "congruence") is a transformation which preserves length..."&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Academ Reflections with parallel axis on wallpaper.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[Function composition|composition]] of two [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|opposite]] isometries is a direct isometry.  [[Reflection (mathematics)|A reflection]] in a line is an opposite isometry, like  {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}  or {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt;}}  on the image. [[Translation (geometry)|Translation]] {{math|''T''}} is a direct isometry: [[Rigid body|a rigid motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|p=46}} &lt;p&gt;'''3.51''' ''Any direct isometry is either a translation or a rotation. Any opposite isometry is either a reflection or a glide reflection.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Introduction==
Given a metric space (loosely, a set and a scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set), an isometry is a [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] which maps elements to the same or another metric space such that the distance between the image elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], two geometric figures are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if they are related by an isometry;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=39}}&lt;p&gt;'''3.11''' ''Any two congruent triangles are related by a unique isometry.''&lt;/ref&gt; the isometry that relates them is either a rigid motion (translation or rotation), or a [[Function composition|composition]] of a rigid motion and a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].&lt;!--commentary: i presume "they" here means the geometric figures. still commenting out because it doesn't seem to help.--&gt; &lt;!--They are equal, up to an action of a rigid motion, if related by a [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometry]] (orientation preserving).--&gt;

Isometries are often used in constructions where one space is [[Embedding|embedded]] in another space. For instance, the [[Complete space#Completion|completion]] of a metric space ''M'' involves an isometry from ''M'' into ''M''', a [[quotient set]] of the space of [[Cauchy sequence]]s on ''M''. The original space ''M'' is thus isometrically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a subspace of a [[complete metric space]], and it is usually identified with this subspace. Other embedding constructions show that every metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a [[closed set|closed subset]] of some [[normed vector space]] and that every complete metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some [[Banach space]].

An isometric surjective linear operator on a [[Hilbert space]] is called a [[unitary operator]].

==Formal definitions==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[metric space]]s with metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. A [[function (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is called an '''isometry''' or '''distance preserving''' if for any ''a'',''b'' ∈ ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;d_Y\left(f(a),f(b)\right)=d_X(a,b).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An isometry is automatically [[Injective function|injective]];&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef/&gt; otherwise two distinct points, ''a'' and ''b'', could be mapped to the same point, thereby contradicting the coincidence axiom of the metric ''d''. This proof is similar to the proof that an [[order embedding]] between [[partially ordered set]]s is injective. Clearly, every isometry between metric spaces is a topological embedding.

A '''global isometry''', '''isometric isomorphism''' or '''congruence mapping''' is a [[bijective]] isometry. Like any other bijection, a global isometry has a [[function inverse]].  The inverse of a global isometry is also a global isometry.

Two metric spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are called '''isometric''' if there is a bijective isometry from ''X'' to ''Y''. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of bijective isometries from a metric space to itself forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with respect to [[function composition]], called the '''[[isometry group]]'''.

There is also the weaker notion of ''path isometry'' or ''arcwise isometry'':

A '''path isometry''' or '''arcwise isometry''' is a map which preserves the [[Arc length#Definition|lengths of curves]]; such a map is not necessarily an isometry in the distance preserving sense, and it need not necessarily be bijective, or even injective. This term is often abridged to simply ''isometry'', so one should take care to determine from context which type is intended.

==Examples==
* Any [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] is a global isometry on Euclidean spaces. See also [[Euclidean group#Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions|Euclidean group]].
*The map &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a path isometry but not an isometry.  Note that unlike an isometry, it is not injective.
*The isometric [[linear map]]s from '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to itself are given by the [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roweis | first1 = S.

==Linear isometry==

Given two [[normed vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'', a '''linear isometry''' is a [[linear map]] ''f'' : ''V'' → ''W'' that preserves the norms:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(v)\| = \|v\|&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''v'' in ''V''.&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Jesper Funch |date=2017 |title=Lineær algebra |trans-title=Linear algebra |page=125 |language=Danish |location=Århus |publisher=Department of Mathematics, Aarhus University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear isometries are distance-preserving maps in the above sense. They are global isometries if and only if they are [[surjective]].

By the [[Mazur-Ulam theorem]], any isometry of normed vector spaces over '''R''' is [[Affine transformation|affine]].

In an inner product space, the fact that any linear isometry is an orthogonal transformation can be shown by using [[Polarization identity|polarization identities]] to
prove ''&lt;Ax, Ay&gt; = &lt;x, y&gt;''&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"/&gt; and then applying the [[Riesz representation theorem]].

==Generalizations==
* Given a positive real number ε, an '''ε-isometry''' or '''almost isometry''' (also called a '''[[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] approximation''') is a map &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; between metric spaces such that
*# for ''x'',''x''&amp;prime; ∈ ''X'' one has |''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(ƒ(''x''),ƒ(''x''&amp;prime;))&amp;minus;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''x''&amp;prime;)| &lt; ε, and
*# for any point ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' there exists a point ''x'' ∈ ''X'' with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'',ƒ(''x'')) &lt; ε

:That is, an ε-isometry preserves distances to within ε and leaves no element of the codomain further than ε away from the image of an element of the domain.  Note that ε-isometries are not assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]].

*The '''[[restricted isometry property]]''' characterizes nearly isometric matrices for sparse vectors.
*'''[[Quasi-isometry]]''' is yet another useful generalization.
* One may also define an element in an abstract unital C*-algebra to be an isometry: 
*:&lt;math&gt; a\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry if and only if &lt;math&gt; a^* \cdot a = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
:Note that as mentioned in the introduction this is not necessarily a unitary element because one does not in general have that left inverse is a right inverse.

*On a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]], the term ''isometry'' means a linear bijection preserving magnitude. See also [[Quadratic form#Quadratic spaces|Quadratic spaces]].

'''''Jewess with Oranges''''' ({{lang-pl|Żydówka z pomarańczami, Pomarańczarka, Przekupka z Pomarańczami}}) is an 1880-1881 [[oil painting]] on canvas by the Polish artist [[Aleksander Gierymski]]. During [[World War II]], the painting was stolen by German forces and recovered in 2011.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewess with Oranges|url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/en/portfolio/jewess-with-oranges/|publisher=Lost Museum|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It was painted in oil technique in 1880-1881 in [[Warsaw]]. The painting shows a Jewish shopkeeper, whom the artist immortalized in another image ''[[Jewess with Lemons]]''. The woman has poor clothing, a cap on her head, and a scarf on her shoulders. She is carrying two baskets of oranges. The background depicts the roofs of Warsaw houses. The woman's face is serious. Her highlighted cheeks and prominent wrinkles heighten the effect of sadness and helplessness, which directly emanate from her character. In contrast, there are oranges whose color is a reference to life, heat, and the southern climate. The painter signed his name in the lower left corner and put the name of the city where he painted the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elżbieta|first=Rogowska|title=ŻYDÓWKA Z POMARAŃCZAMI|journal=Cenne, Bezcenne, Utracone|date=June–September 2011|volume=3 | issue = 64|pages=3–5|url=http://www.nimoz.pl/upload/wydawnictwa/cenne_bezcenne_utracone/2011_3/gierymski.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013|publisher=Narodowy Instytut Muzealnictwa i Ochrony Zbiorów|language=Polish|issn=1428-6467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The image originally belonged to the antique store Dom Sztuki in Warsaw and later was purchased by the National Museum in Warsaw. During World War II, the painting was stolen by German forces, and since 1945, Poland had sought its return.  In 2010, the painting appeared in an antique market in Northern Germany and [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of Poland]] began negotiations to bring the painting to Poland, which was successful in 2011, after compensation was paid out by the Polish PZU Foundation to the German owner. The amount paid has not been disclosed.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

'''Jewish paper cutting''' is a traditional form of [[Jewish]] [[folk art]] made by cutting figures and sentences in paper or [[parchment]]. 
It is connected with various customs and ceremonies, and associated with holidays and family life. Paper cuts often decorated [[Ketubah|ketubbot]] (marriage contracts), [[Mizrah]]s, and ornaments for festive occasions.  Paper cutting was practiced by Jewish communities in both Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Middle East for centuries and has seen a revival in modern times in Israel and elsewhere.

== History ==
[[File:Swiat. Agata Szepe 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish papercut "The World" &lt;br/&gt;by Agata Szepe]]

=== Origins ===
The origin of Jewish paper cutting is unclear. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries practiced this type of art. However, Jewish paper cuts can be traced to Jewish communities in Syria, Iraq, and North Africa, and the similarity in the cutting techniques (using a knife) between East European Jews and [[Chinese paper cutting|Chinese paper cutters]], may indicate that the origin goes back even further. Some contend that Ashkenazi paper-cutting may date to the 14th century, though its popularity reached a zenith in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The first mention of Jewish paper cutting can be found in the treatise "The fight of the pen and the scissors” by a 14th-century rabbi, Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Ardutiel (1290-1369), who describes how he decided to cut letters in paper when his ink became frozen during a harsh winter. To students of Christian Spanish literary history, Rabbi Shem Tov is known as Santob de Carrion de los Condes, the courtly [[Castilian people|Castilian]] troubadour who composed the Proverbios morales for Pedro the Cruel.&lt;ref name=MyJewishLearning-JewishPapercutting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shadur |first1=Joseph |title=Jewish Papercutting: Folk art even the poorest folk could create |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |website=My Jewish Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107002727/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper cutting as a folk craft gained popularity in the nineteenth century when paper became a cheap material.&lt;ref name=ZygmuntFrankel-1&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Giza|title=The Art of the Jewish Papercut |url=http://www.zygmuntfrankel.com/jewishpapercut.html |work=ZygmuntFrankel.com |publisher=Etcetera Editions|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper cutting was widespread among the [[Jews of Poland]] and [[Jews of Russia|Russia]] in the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. Jewish paper cuts were also produced in Germany and probably in the Netherlands. Some [[Jews of Italy|Italian Jewish]] [[parchment]] ketubot (marriage contracts) from the late 17th century until the nineteenth century were decorated paper cuts as well as some elaborate scrolls of the [[Book of Esther]]. Similar paper cuttings from Jewish communities North Africa and the Middle East have some characteristic style differences.

It was popular among Jews both in eastern and western Europe as well as in Turkey, Morocco, Syria, Bangladesh, Israel, and North America.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska&gt;{{cite book|last=Gołąb|first=Marta|title=Jewish paper-cut = Wycinanka żydowska|year=2006|publisher=Wydawnictwo "Hagada"|location=Kraków|isbn=9788391507605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Africa and the Middle East paper cuts were called a "Menorah", because one or more [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], always appeared as the central motif. These paper cuts included many inscriptions, mostly on the arms of the candelabras. The paper was mounted on thin, colored metal sheets. Two distinct kinds were produced: a Mizrah and smaller paper cuts used as charms. The motifs are the same as in European Jewish paper cuts but they have a distinctive Eastern style. Also, the [[hamsa]] ("the five-finger hand"), unknown in Europe, very often appears on these paper cuts.

=== Disappearance ===
Jewish paper cutting began disappearing in the first half of the twentieth century, mainly because of the rapid assimilation trends and the waning of many traditional practices, and was practiced only by older people who remembered this art form from their youth. Many paper cuts collections that had been preserved were destroyed during [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and relatively few remain in public or private collections.

=== Resurgence ===
Since the late twentieth century, Jewish paper cuts have again become a popular art form in both [[Israel]] and other countries. Paper cutting is again often used to decorate [[ketubot]], wedding invitations, and works of art. To a limited extent, Jewish paper cuts have become more popular in Poland as a result of the [[Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków]], a festival that has been held in [[Kraków]] since the 1990s.

[[Beit Hatefutsot]] – The Museum of the Jewish People in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]] presented a 2009 exhibition called "The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art" in October 2009. The exhibit was curated by Prof. Olga Goldberg, Gabriella Rabbi, Rina Biran, the Giza Frenkel Papercut Archive, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Additionally, a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded study called “Tradition and Continuity in Jewish Papercuts” was conducted by Prof. Olga Goldberg.&lt;ref name=BeitHatfutsot-exhibition&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art|url=http://www.bh.org.il/event/revival-jewish-papercuts/|publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |location=Tel Aviv, Israel|date=October 1, 2009 – January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Oren Loloi writes that the art of Jewish papercutting's resurgence is due in large part to the efforts of Polish-Jewish anthropologist and ethnologist Giza Frankel (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loloi|first1=Oren|title=What is Jewish paper-cutting?|url=https://www.papercutsbyoren.com/jewish-papercutting/|website=Paper Cuts by Oren|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/migzerot-neyar-omanut-yehudit-amamit/oclc/27227163 Frankel's 1983 book], ''The Art of the Jewish Papercut'' (Migzerot neyar: omanut Yehudit amamit), was produced after 50 years of painstaking research. 

Today, Jewish papercut art has grown in popularity beyond ritual items to art and expressions of Jewish faith, not only in Israel but worldwide. Loloi contends that the resurgence in papercutting's popularity is in part due to its contemporary near-ubiquity as part of the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract), which is a contemporary site of ''hiddur mitzvah'', the Jewish principle of honouring the Divine by beautifying ritual objects. Contemporary papercutting art may also be seen in amulets like [[Hamsa|hamsas]], [[Birkat HaBayit|blessings for the home]], [[Mizrah#Mizrah_in_Jewish_homes|mizrahim]], and other art pieces, usually as a wall plaque.

Masada |url=http://www.cyfrowaetnografia.pl/Content/3342/Strony+od+PSL_XLIII_nr1-2-23_recenzje.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giza Frankel brought knowledge of Polish Jewish paper cuts with her when she emigrated to Israel in 1950.&lt;ref name=Goldberg-Mulkiewicz-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg-Mulkiewicz|first=Olga|title=Dr Giza Frenkel (Frankel) 16.09. 1895 Wieliczka - 17.05.1984 Haifa|page=139 |url=http://www.cyfrowaetnografia.pl/Content/3343/Strony+od+PSL_XLIII_nr1-2-24_wspomnienie.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frankel, the most famous Polish papercutters are [[:pl:Marta Gołąb|Marta Gołąb]] and [[:pl:Monika Krajewska|Monika Krajewska]].

=== Marta Gołąb ===
Marta Gołąb is both a graphic artist and papercutter.&lt;ref name=MartaGolab&gt;{{cite web|title=Marta Gołąb z Krakowa: "Wycinanki Żydowskie": 12.09 - 11.10.2002 |url=http://jasnet.pl/ciasna/golab/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125023500/http://jasnet.pl/ciasna/GOLAB/INDEX.HTM |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her papercuts were exhibited in the Jewish Museum (Wien) Skirball Cultural Center, (Los Angeles), in Emanu-El Synagogue (San Francisco), in the Synagogue in Grobzig (Germany) and on the [[Jewish Culture Festival in Krakow]].

=== Monika Krajewska ===
Monika Krajewska's interests was focus on symbols related both to Jewish papercut and sepulchral art, according to [[:pl:Wycinanka żydowska|Wycinanka żydowska]].

== Uses ==
[[Image:Mizrah.jpg|thumb|right|300 pxs|''Mizrah'' papercut, [[Eastern Europe]], 19th century]]

=== Types ===
Depending on their purpose, shape and connection with specific religious and non-religious events, paper cuts are of different types.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce&gt;{{cite book|last=Fränklowa|first=Giza|title=Wycinanka zydowska w Polsce: (Papierschnitte bei den Juden in Polen)|year=1929 |publisher=Nakł Towarzystwa Ludoznawczego |location=Lwów |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10628388|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–57}}

A Mizrah (hebr. The East) is a plaque hung on the east wall of private houses to show the direction of Jerusalem. A shivis’i (hebr. always) is similar to a mizrah, but it hangs on the east side of a synagogue. Its name is connected with a sentence from the Bible: 'Shivis'i adonai l'negdi tamid' ('I have set the LORD always before me').&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|4}} Shivis’i in the form of paper cuts rather than some more durable material were only used in poor synagogues.

There were also various paper cuts made for special, religious celebrations. Shevuoslekh ("little Shavuots") and ''royzelekh'' (rosettes) decorated windows for [[Shavuot]]. Royzelekh are circle-shaped paper cuts, while Shevuoslekh are rectangular. They were often made by pupils in elementary Jewish religious schools ([[Cheder]]s). They were sometimes decorated with motifs unconnected to religion, such as soldiers or riders.

Flags for [[Simchat Torah|Simchat-Torah]] were also made by ''cheder'' pupils. Created from colourful paper, each paper cut symbolized one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The other side of the paper showed an image of Torah with moving doors cut in paper. Paper cuts made for Sukkot were formed into lanterns, chains and birds, hung in [[Sukkah]]s.

Paper cuts often decorated a plaque with a prayer called Ushpizin, made for Sukkot. Paper cuts were also created for Purim, often containing the Hebrew sentence: ”Mishenekhnas adar marbin b’simcha’ (‘We should rejoice because (the month of) Adar begins') and cut into an image of a bottle and glasses, a symbol of rejoicing.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Papercutting also has connections with other forms of Jewish tradition. For example, [[Ketubah]]s (marriage agreements) were sometimes prepared in the form of paper cut, or decorated with paper cutting elements. Also cut into paper, memorial plaques were made to commemorate the names of ancestors’ names and dates of birth and death. Lanterns with papercut walls were placed in synagogues for anniversaries of great men’s death.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Amulets like a [[Hamsa]] often showed an image of a palm with an eye on it.

== Characteristics ==

=== Features ===
Paper cuts traditionally were created with the use of shoemaker’s knife. It is likely that most artists were men, though in later years, schoolgirls (and boys) made little rosettes (called ''royzelekh'' or ''reyzelekh'' in [[Yiddish]]) with scissors, to decorate their notebooks or for holiday decorations in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michlic|first1=Joanna Beata|title=Toys and Games|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Toys_and_Games|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist first drew the pattern on a paper or parchment, and then cut it. Sometimes, they painted their work in watercolors. Paper cuts were usually glued to a contrasting background in a specific way, to bring the cut paper into relief. Hebrew sentences were important element of the composition. The words were either cut or drawn on paper. Elements of [[micrography]], another traditional type of Jewish folk art, can be seen in these blocks of text created with the artist's knife. Due to [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism's aniconism]], it is rare to see a paper-cut from this period that depicts the human figure. Exceptions are Sephardic [[Ketubot]] depicting the bride and bridegroom.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

=== Styles ===
Traditionally, paper cuts made by [[Sephardic]] and Ashkenazi Jews differed from each other. Ashkenazi papercuts were rich, highly detailed, and colourful. In this style, artists tried to fill the free space with as many elements as is possible. By contrast, the Sephardic compositions were more minimalist, including motifs such as the menorah, columns, [[Arabesque|arabesques]] and lanterns.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt; Modern Jewish paper cut art is done in many styles and is not limited to the aforementioned symbols and motifs. They may be single-layered or multi-layered.

=== Symbols ===
Every element of Jewish paper cut has its own symbolism. Some are typical of general Jewish culture, others are peculiar to the art of paper cutting. The most important symbols are placed along the [[axis of symmetry]].

The main symbols are usually a [[Torah]] or a [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]:
* The image of the Torah symbolizes God’s law, Judaism, Israel. The [[Star of David]] symbolizes Judaism and Israel
* The Menorah symbolizes Israel, Judaism, and [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The middle flame is a symbol of ‘[[Shekinah]]’ (Hebrew for God’s presence); the other flames are shown as leaning towards the main flame. The bottom of the menorah is often shown as a complicated ornament symbolizing [[infinity]]

A range of animals are depicted in paper cuts:
* [[Lions]], a biblical symbol of the [[Tribe of Judah]], are associated with strength, bravery, power&lt;ref name=Litin-KehilaLinks&gt;{{cite web|title="Mizrah" Papercut for a Succah - Litin, Ukraine - 1858|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/litin/papercut.html|work=Litin, Ukraine|publisher=JewishGen|format=KehilaLinks}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Deer]] symbolize the [[Tribe of Naphtali]]&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name=Shivtei-Yisrael&gt;{{cite web|last=Mael|first=Rabbi Fishel|title=Characteristics of the Tribe of Naphtali|url=http://www.britam.org/mael/Mael13Naphtali.html|work=Shivtei Yisrael|publisher=Brit-Am}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Birds]] are associated with the human soul 
* [[Fish]] are usually connected with fertility
* A [[squirrel]] biting a nut symbolizes the effort put into reading the Torah
* The Four Animals (a [[leopard]], an [[eagle]], a [[gazelle]], and a [[lion]]) are connected with a sentence from [[Pirkei Avot]]: “Be strong as the leopard, swift as the eagle, fleet as the gazelle, and brave as the lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven”&lt;ref name=Mishnah-Pirkei-Avot&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishnah Pirkei Avot|url=http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|work=Ethics Of The Fathers|location=Chapter 5, Number 23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190001/http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[snake eating its own tail]] symbolizes [[infinity]]&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

Papercut flora is usually connected with the biblical [[Tree of Life]],&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}} with some of the plants having their specific symbolism. For example, [[vine]] was associated with the land of Israel and with fertility, [[pomegranates]] symbolized fertility, etc.

Others symbols were connected both with tradition and with everyday life:
* [[Signs of the Zodiac]] showed the sequence of Jewish celebrations during the year
* Often positioned above the Torah or a Menorah, the crown is a symbol of God, the Torah, the Kingdom of Israel or the Priesthood&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|5}} 
* Columns and other [[wikt:architectonic|architectonic]] elements are associated with the Temple in Jerusalem
* Hands with joined thumbs are a gesture of blessing
* A jug filled with water and a bowl symbolize the [[Tribe of Levi]], blessing or the Priesthood

== Methodology ==
The images are created by cutting a design into a folded piece of paper. When the paper is unfolded, the symmetrical design is revealed.&lt;ref name=Bib-Arch-Shadur&gt;{{cite web|last=Shadur|first=Yehudit|title=How Yehudit Shadur Makes a Paper-Cut|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBR&amp;Volume=2&amp;Issue=2&amp;ArticleID=14|work=BR (Bible Review)|date=Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper can be cut using either scissors or a craft knife.

'''Lance Fung''' is an art [[curator]] who has been responsible for several major exhibitions including "Snow Show" at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Torino, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/11890/art-at-the-olympics-and-beyond-a-chat-with-lance-fung-the-collaborationist/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/garden/02snow.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Fung founded Fung Collaboratives, an inter-disciplinary arts organization. Most recently, Fung transformed vacant lots in [[Atlantic City]] into a park system through his exhibition ''Artlantic''. These “giant living sculptures” attract local residents and visiting art enthusiasts to experience art in “green” settings designed by Fung and the participants Diana Balmori, Robert Barry, Peter Hutchinson, Ilya &amp; Emilia Kabakov, John Roloff, and Kiki Smith.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/arts/design/artlantic-weathers-hurricane-in-atlantic-city.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Fung is curating ''Nonuments'' in Washington D.C. for the 5 x 5 project organized by the [[DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities]]. This project will result in five temporary monuments commemorating current issues such as the survivors of human trafficking, global warming, and immigrant conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://dcarts.dc.gov/release/district-will-be-canvas-25-public-art-installations-fall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the5x5project.com/lance-fung/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Light Motion Dance Company''' is a two-woman integrated dance company based in [[Seattle]], combining a wheelchair dancer and an able-bodied dancer in performances.

==Overview==
Light Motion Dance Company was founded in 1988. The creative forces behind the company are Charlene Curtiss and Joanne Petroff. Performances feature both choreography and improvised dance. Light Motion Dance tours throughout the United States and internationally.&lt;ref name="NADC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Motion Dance Company|url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/nadc/support-resource/light-motion-dance-company|publisher=National Arts and Disability Center, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workshops for school children and adults are also part of Light Motion Dance's initiatives.&lt;ref name="NWRSCIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinal Cord Injury Update (Fall 1997): Dancing on Wheels|url=http://sci.washington.edu/info/newsletters/articles/97f_dancing_on_wheels.asp|publisher=Northwest Regional Spinal Cord Injury System|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performances feature the choreography of Curtiss, who developed "front-end" wheelchair manoeuvers through her own experimentation and practise. Performances have been described as "virtuosic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Ann Cooper|title=Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance|year=1997|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819563156|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlene Curtiss began using a wheelchair after a gymnastics accident resulted in her becoming paraplegic at age 17 (Curtiss has T12 paraplegia). She became a lawyer, but her interest in wheelchair dance led to her leaving law, and forming the Light Motion Dance Company. In 1990, Curtiss added able-bodied dancer Joanne Petroff to the company. Curtiss has several years' experience as a college-level competitive swimmer, and as a wheelchair athlete in track and field competitions. She also occasionally delivers training in wheelchair aerobics and front-end chair control techniques to inpatients and outpatients at the [[University of Washington Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="NWRSCIS"/&gt;

In addition to performance work, Light Motion Dance Company has helped in the establishment of other integrated dance companies in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref name="NADC"/&gt;

A '''literary agent''' (sometimes ''[[publishing]] agent'', or ''writer's representative'') is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] who represents [[writer]]s and their written works to [[publisher]]s, [[theatrical producer]]s, [[film producer]]s, and [[film studio]]s, and assists in the sale and deal negotiation of the same. Literary agents most often represent [[novelist]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, and non-fiction writers. They are paid a fixed percentage (usually twenty percent on foreign sales and ten to fifteen percent for domestic sales)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/|title=LITERARY AGENTS – SFWA|work=SFWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the proceeds of sales they negotiate on behalf of their clients.

== Advantages ==
Literary agents perform various services for authors. They connect the author's work with appropriate publishers, negotiate contracts, ensure royalty payments, and mediating problems between author and publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howpublishingreallyworks.com/?page_id=166 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501141451/http://howpublishingreallyworks.com/?page_id=166 |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents can help new authors get public recognition. Agents also help publishing houses and others expedite the process of review, publication, and distribution of authors' works. Many well-known, powerful, and lucrative publishing houses (such as the [[Big Five (publishers)|Big Five]]) are generally less open than smaller publishers to unrepresented submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherylreif.com/2012/04/27/small-vs-big-six-publishers-whats-the-difference/|title=Small vs Big Six Publishers: What’s the Difference?|author=Cheryl Reif|work=Cheryl Reif Writes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A knowledgeable agent knows the market, and can be a source of valuable career advice and guidance. Being a publishable author doesn't automatically make someone an expert on modern publishing contracts and practices—especially where television, film, or foreign rights are involved.  Many authors prefer to have an agent handle such matters. This prevents straining the author's working relationship with the [[editing|editor]] with disputes about royalty statements or late checks. 

An agent can also function as an adviser, showing an author the various aspects of how to make a living writing. Literary agents often transition from jobs in other aspects of the publishing industry. Though [[self-publishing]] is becoming much more popular, literary agents still fulfill a useful role as gatekeepers to publishing houses.

== Diversity ==
Literary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent—for example—authors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry.

Legitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to ''[[Writer's Market]]'' listings, many agents in the [[United States]] are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaronline.org/Join|title=Association of Authors' Representatives, Inc. - Join|work=aaronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective professional agents often learn their trade while working for another agent, though some cross over to agenting after working as editors.

== Cost ==
Legitimate agents do not charge reading or other upfront fees (e.g., retainers), or bill authors for most operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pred-ed.com/pubagent.htm|title=Preditors &amp; Editors|work=pred-ed.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722044734/http://pred-ed.com/pubagent.htm|archivedate=2012-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachellegardner.com/2011/08/questionable-practices-by-literary-agents/|title=Questionable Practices by Literary Agents|work=Rachelle Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also do not offer to place work with a [[vanity press|vanity or subsidy press]].

== Querying ==
A client typically establishes a relationship with an agent through ''querying'', though the two may meet at a writers' conference, through a contest, or in other ways.  A query is an unsolicited proposal for representation, either for a finished work or unfinished work.  Various agents request different elements in a query packet, and most agencies list their specific submission requirement on their Website or in their listing in major directories. It typically begins with the author sending a query letter (1-2 pages) that explains the purpose of the work and any writing qualifications of the author. Some agencies want a synopsis or outline as part of the query.  Often, the author sends the first three chapters (typically around 50 pages) of their work. For paper queries, the author must include a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] to receive a response, though email submissions are increasingly common.

If an agency rejects a written query, they send the response—typically a form letter—in the self-addressed stamped envelope.  A rejection that is not merely a form letter, or has hand-written comments (especially a message to the effect of "query me for other projects") is typically a good sign.

== Notable agents ==

The first literary agents appeared around the year 1880 ([[#References|Publishing]]).

'''''Lucretia''''' is a 1666 history painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Rembrandt]] in the collection of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]].

==Painting ==
[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''[[Lucretia (Rembrandt, 1664)|Lucretia]]'', 1664 (attribution debated)]]

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote:"220. LUCRETIA. [[Eugène Dutuit|Dut.]] 115 ; Wb. 267. She has a dagger in her right hand, and holds a cord in her left hand. "Of nobler composition and greater breadth of light than is usual in Rembrandt ; at the same time the treatment is of singular breadth and spirit" ([[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]]). Dated 1666. In the Wombwell collection, London, 1854 (Waagen, ii. 308).&lt;br&gt;
220a. Lucretia with the Dagger. The sitter is a genuine Dutch-woman, but the expression of pain is well rendered not only in the features but also in the pale colour. Admirably painted. Mentioned by Waagen, iv. 477. In the Radziwill collection, according to the Burdon catalogue. 
''Sales''. London, 1853 (Burdon). W. W. Burdon of Newcastle, London, 1862 (bought in)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn06hofsuoft#page/144/mode/1up  Entry 220 for ''''Lucretia''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the RKD both catalog number 220 and 220a refer to the same painting, in the collections of John Calvert Wombwell and [[Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/59675 Lucretia] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years earlier Rembrandt possibly made [[Lucretia (Rembrandt, 1664)|another painting]] of Lucretia, depicting the moment before she stabs herself; the attribution is debated.

Fraser left drumming to join [[Graeae Theatre Company]], Europe's leading [[disabled]] theatre company after their production of Ubu inspired him to change careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roguesandvagabonds.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/archive-interview-%E2%80%A2-mat-fraser-%E2%80%A2-on-blindness-%E2%80%A2-2004/|title=Rogues and Vagabonds|last=Vernon|first=Sarah|date=2004|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in forum theatre for Graeae for several months, then landed the part of Dr Prentice in Joe Orton's ''What the Butler Saw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/03/features11.g29|title=The Guardian|date=3 March 1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is now a patron of Graeae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.graeae.org/patrons/mat-fraser/|title=Graeae|date=|website= graeae.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent theatre roles in the '90s included the Group K production of ''Marisol'' and the title role in ''Johnny Sol'' at the Croydon Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/932307/| title= B.F.I.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote 2005's ''[[Thalidomide!! A Musical]]'', in which he and Anna Winslet played all the roles.

His first major television role was in the three-part World War II drama series Unknown Soldier  (ITV, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/932307/|title= B.F.I. Screenonline |date= |website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 he appeared in Channel Four's ''[[Cast Offs]]'', a six-part comedy-drama series satirising reality television .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/6624315/Cameras-love-the-disabled-but-not-disability-says-Cast-Offs-star.html|title=The Telegraph|last=Craig|first=Olga|date=21 Nov 2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fraser has been associated with the use of term "spacking up" to describe when a non-disabled actor plays the part of a disabled person rather than the part going to a disabled actor, as a play on [[blackface|"blacking up",]] used to describe the controversial practice where non-black actors take on the characters of black people. The term was actually coined by one of the show's writers, in the line "spacking up is the new blacking up&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoinbutler.com/interviews/i%E2%80%99m-a-bit-surprised-to-be-referred-to-as-%E2%80%9Cyou-people%E2%80%9D-isn%E2%80%99t-that-kind-of-condescending/ I’m a bit surprised to be referred to as “you people”… Isn’t that kind of condescending?] EoinButler.com (Irish Times), 6 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Fraser was cast as Shakespeare’s King Richard III, ‘a disabled guy gets cast as a disabled guy’,  a role he discussed with Emma Tracey, presenter for [[BBC Radio]]’s service for disabled people, "Ouch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p051dzt1 |title= Richard III: A disabled guy gets cast as a disbled guy |date=28 April 2017 |website= [[BBC]] |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Fraser was cast in the upcoming [[BBC One]] [[His Dark Materials (TV series)|adaptation]] of [[Philip Pullman]]'s fantasy trilogy [[His Dark Materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/his-dark-materials |title= BBC and Bad Wolf unveil cast and creative team of His Dark Materials |date=27 July 2018 |website= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television presenting ==
Fraser was one of the original co-hosts of the [[BBC]]'s ''Ouch! Podcast''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/podcast Ouch! It's a disability thing] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

He presented the short-lived Channel Four series "Freak Out"&lt;ref name="Abnormally Funny People"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abnormallyfunnypeople.com/mat-fraser|title=Abnormally Funny People|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He presented the 2004 Channel Four documentary "Happy Birthday Thalidomide", documenting how the drug was being used in Brazil to treat leprosy, but that its use in a country with low levels of literacy and a black market in drugs was leading to new thalidomide births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/mar/30/lifeandhealth.brazil|title=The Guardian|last=Fraser|first=Mat|date=30 March 2004|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
Fraser played the lead character, Sparky, in BBC Radio Four's Saturday Playhouse production, "Inmates" (1997), by Allan Sutherland and Stuart Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/52bd80623abd43609377c46b56e12e03|title=BBC|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a regular performer on the BBC Radio Four sketch show "Yes Sir, I Can Boogie".&lt;ref name="Abnormally Funny People"/&gt;

== CDs ==
Fraser has released two rap albums:

"Survival of the Shittest"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Mat-Fraser-Survival-Of-The-Shittest/release/4537250|title=Discogs:Survival Of The Shittest|date=|website=|publisher=Discogs|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freak shows ==
Fraser has shown a continuing interest in freak shows.

His 2001 play 'Sealboy: Freak' draws on the life history of Stanislaus Berent, a sideshow performer with naturally occurring phocomelia who worked under the stage name [[Sealo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/932307/|title=B.F.I. Screenonline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser's 2002 television documentary "Born Freak" looked at this historical tradition and its relevance to modern disabled performers.  This work has become the subject of academic analysis in the field of disability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/575/752|title=Disability Studies Quarterly|author1=Mitchell, David  |author2=Snyder, Sharon|date=Summer 2005|website=Volume 25, No. 3|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the documentary, Fraser performed in a Coney Island freak show.  He was invited to return to work there professionally and has since worked several summer seasons there.

Fraser's 2011 show, " From Freak to Clique", charted the history of portrayals of disability, including freak show performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/chicago-theater/news/03-2011/mat-fraser-to-perform-from-freak-to-clique-at-vict_35532.html|title=Theatermania|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Cabinet of Curiosities" ==
Fraser was commissioned by the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries at the University of Leicester to create a new artistic work, shaped out of a collaborative engagement with museum collections, research and expertise in medical history, museums and disability.  The resulting  performance, "Cabinet of Curiosities: How disability was kept in a box" was performed at the Thackray Medical Museum, Leeds, the Silk Mill Museum, Derby and Manchester Museum.  It won the Observer Ethical Awards, Arts and Culture 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/rcmg/projects/cabinet-of-curiosities|title=University of Leicester|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guardian's Lyn Gardner stated that, "by making a spectacle of himself, Fraser is not only raising the spectre of the Victorian freak show but also subverting it by questioning what is exhibited and what isn't, and making us confront what we are shown and what we are not shown, both in art and in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2014/jan/22/disability-mat-fraser-museum-cabinet-curiosities-theatre|title=The Guardian|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=22 January 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mihalarias Art Center''' was established in [[Kolonaki]] in the center of Athens, Greece in 1984. It  went on to open other branches in the city, at the Kifissia Gallery and at the Art City in [[Malakassa]]. 

The gallery Mihalarias Art was officially opened in [[Kifissia]] in May 2005. Stavros Mihalarias, experienced in the establishment of art centers like the neo-classical houses in Athens and the contemporary Art City in Malakasa, renovated the listed building on [[Kifissias Avenue]] and Diligianni with the aim of creating a multifaced art gallery.

Built in the beginning of the 20th century, this building is a jewel in the center of Kifissia with an outside area designed to host exhibitions of sculpture. Paintings and sculptures by Greek and international artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, antiquities, icons and many other works of art are on permanent exhibition in its rooms. Periodical shows and exhibitions in collaboration with international galleries are also organized.

'''''Myojakdo''''' (literally, "Painting of Cats and Sparrows") is a [[Korean painting]] depicting two cats and sparrows on an old tree, drawn by [[Byeon Sang-byeok]] during the late period of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). It is regarded as a representative [[animal painting]] (''yeongmohwa'') and is painted on silk with light coloring over the [[ink and wash painting]] (''sumukhwa''). The Myojakdo is 93.7&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 42.9&amp;nbsp;cm in width.  It forms part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=139066&amp;v=44 |script-title=ko:묘작도 猫雀圖 |trans-title=Myojakdo |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]]/ [[Britannica]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=253618&amp;v=44 |script-title=ko:묘작도 猫雀圖 |trans-title=Myojakdo |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]]/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to as the nicknames, "Byeon goyangi" (literally Byeon cat),&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Hong-jun, [http://sjeas.skku.edu/upload/200605/06_Yu%20Hong-jun.pdf ''An Approach through the theory on Art to theory on Painting of Scholars of the Korean Practical Science"], Sungkyun Journal of East Asian Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2004, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; and "Byeon dak" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. The ''myojakdo'' backs up the record in which Byeon favored cats and devoted to cat paintings.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

Cats and sparrows were often subjects for Korean paintings drawn to celebrate the joy of longevity because of their similar pronunciations with other words that have auspicious meanings. The pronunciation of ''myo'' ({{linktext|猫}}; cat) and ''jak'' ({{linktext|雀}}, sparrow) in [[hanja]] word, or [[Sino-Korean words]] are respectively linked with ''mo'' ({{linktext|耄}}; old person) which refers to 80 or 90 years old, and ''jak'' ({{linktext|鵲}}) which indicates [[Korean magpie|magpie]] having been regarded as an auspicious bird in [[History of Korea|Korean society]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; 

In this painting, cats and sparrows are depicted realistically in a simple and dynamic composition. The depiction of a group of chirping sparrows on twigs are illustrated precisely with very detailed brushstrokes. Byeon's mastered drawing techniques are also noted with the lively facial expressions and moves of the two cats. One cat clinging to the side of an old tree exchanges glances with the other on the ground in the diagonal composition as if they communicated with each other. On the other hand, the body of the old tree is drawn with rather wild brushstrokes, which represents the meager texture and the distorted shape having formed for a long time. The stark contrast between the way the animals and trees are applied gives a strong feeling of movement to the picture.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19653">{{Distinguish|Religion and mythology}}
{{Anthropology of religion}}
'''Myth and ritual''' are two central components of religious practice. Although [[myth]] and [[ritual]] are commonly united as parts of [[religion]], the exact relationship between them has been a matter of controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is "the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory," held notably by the so-called [[Cambridge Ritualists]], which holds that "myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal61"/&gt; This theory is still disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"/&gt;

==Overview==
The "[[myth and ritual school]]" is the name given to a series of authors who have focused their [[philological]] studies on the "ritual purposes of myths."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica entries on [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-400991/Myth-and-Ritual-School Myth and Ritual School (religion)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these scholars (e.g., [[W. Robertson-Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[S. H. Hooke]]) supported the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis, which claimed that "every myth is derived from a particular ritual and that the [[syntagmatic]] quality of myth is a reproduction of the succession of ritual act."&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"&gt;Meletinsky, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the important approaches to the study of [[mythological]] thinking have been those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the [[Soviet school]], and the Myth and Ritual School.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Soviet researchers such as [[Jakov E. Golosovker]], [[Frank-Kamenecky]], [[Olga Freidenberg]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], "grounded the study of myth and ritual in [[folklore]] and in the [[world view]] of [[popular culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meletinsky, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the [[semantic]] study of myth and ritual, particularly by [[Bill Stanner]] and [[Victor Turner]], has supported a connection between myth and ritual. However, it has not supported the notion that one preceded and produced the other, as supporters of the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis would claim. According to the currently dominant scholarly view, the link between myth and ritual is that they share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"/&gt;

==Ritual from myth==
One possibility immediately presents itself: perhaps ritual arose from myth. Many religious rituals—notably [[Passover]] among Jews, [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] among Christians, and the [[Hajj]] among Muslims—commemorate, or involve commemoration of, events in religious literature.

===E. B. Tylor===
Leaving the sphere of historical religions, the ritual-from-myth approach often sees the relationship between myth and ritual as analogous to the relationship between science and technology. The pioneering anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] is the classic exponent of this view.&lt;ref name="Segal63"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He saw myth as an attempt to explain the world: for him, myth was a sort of proto-science.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual is secondary: just as technology is an application of science, so ritual is an application of myth—an attempt to produce certain effects, given the supposed nature of the world: "For Tylor, myth functions to explain the world as an end in itself. Ritual applies that explanation to control the world."&lt;ref name="Segal63"/&gt; A ritual always presupposes a preexisting myth: in short, myth gives rise to ritual.

==Myth from ritual (primacy of ritual)==
Against the intuitive idea that ritual reenacts myth or applies mythical theories, many 19th-century anthropologists supported the opposite position: that myth and religious doctrine result from ritual. This is known as the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis.

===William Robertson Smith===
This view was asserted for the first time by the bible scholar [[William Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"&gt;Meletinsky pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar [[Meletinsky]] notes that Smith introduced the concept "dogmatically."&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"/&gt; In his ''Lectures on the Religion of the Semites'' (1889), Smith draws a distinction between ancient and modern religion: in modern religion, doctrine is central; in ancient religion, ritual is central.&lt;ref name="Segal61"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, Smith argues, ancients tended to be conservative with regard to rituals, making sure to pass them down faithfully. In contrast, the myths that justified those rituals could change. In fact, according to Smith, many of the myths that have come down to us arose "after the original, nonmythic reason [...] for the ritual had somehow been forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, Smith gives the worship of [[Adonis]]. Worshipers mourned Adonis's mythical death in a ritual that coincided with the annual withering of the vegetation. According to Smith, the ritual mourning originally had a nonmythical explanation: with the annual withering of plants, "the worshippers lament out of natural sympathy [...] just as modern man is touched with melancholy at the falling of autumn leaves."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Once worshipers forgot the original, nonmythical reason for the mourning ritual, they created "the myth of Adonis as the dying and rising god of vegetation [...] to account for the ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal63"/&gt;

===Stanley Edgar Hyman===
In his essay "The Ritual View of Myth and the Mythic," (1955) Stanley Edgar Hyman makes an argument similar to Smith's:
{{quote|"In Fiji [...] the physical peculiarities of an island with only one small patch of fertile soil are explained by a myth telling how Mberewalaki, a culture hero, flew into a passion at the misbehavior of the people of the island and hurled all the soil he was bringing them in a heap, instead of laying it out properly. Hocart points out that the myth is used aetiologically to explain the nature of the island, but did not originate in that attempt. The adventures of Mberewalaki originated, like all mythology, in ritual performance, and most of the lore of Hocart's Fijian informants consisted of such ritual myths.  When they get interested in the topology of the island or are asked about it, Hocart argues, they do precisely what we would do, which is ransack their lore for an answer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 68, No. 270, ''Myth: A Symposium'' (1955), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Hyman argues against the etiological interpretation of myth, which says that myths originated from attempts to explain the origins ([[etiology|etiologies]]) of natural phenomena. If true, the etiological interpretation would make myth older than, or at least independent of, ritual—as E.B. Tylor believes it is. But Hyman argues that people use myth for etiological purposes only after myth is already in place: in short, myths didn't originate as explanations of natural phenomena. Further, Hyman argues, myth originated from ritual performance. Thus, ritual came before myth, and myth depends on ritual for its existence until it gains an independent status as an etiological story.

===James Frazer===
The famous anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] claimed that myth emerges from ritual during the natural process of religious evolution. Many of his ideas were inspired by those of [[Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"/&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890; 1906–1915), Frazer famously argues that man progresses from belief in magic (and rituals based on magic), through belief in religion, to science.&lt;ref name="Frazer711"&gt;Frazer, p. 711''&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows.

Man starts out with a reflexive belief in a natural law. He thinks he can influence nature by correctly applying this law: "In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate for his own ends."&lt;ref name="Frazer711"/&gt;

However, the natural law man imagines—namely, magic—does not work. When he sees that his pretended natural law is false, man gives up the idea of a knowable natural law and "throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself."&lt;ref name="Frazer711"/&gt; In other words, when man loses his belief in magic, he justifies his formerly magical rituals by saying that they reenact myths or honor mythical beings. According to Frazer,
{{quote|"myth changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Jane Ellen Harrison and S. H. Hooke===
The classicist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] and the biblical scholar [[S. H. Hooke]] regarded myth as intimately connected to ritual. However, "against Smith," they "vigorously deny" that myth's main purpose is to justify a ritual by giving an account of how it first arose (e.g., justifying the Adonis worshipers' ritual mourning by attributing it to Adonis's mythical death).&lt;ref name="Segal71"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, these scholars think a myth is largely just a narrative description of a corresponding ritual: according to Harrison, "the primary meaning of myth ... is the spoken correlative of the acted rite, the thing done."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison and Hooke gave an explanation for why ancients would feel the need to describe the ritual in a narrative form. They suggest that the spoken word, like the acted ritual, was considered to have magical potency: "The spoken word had the efficacy of an act."&lt;ref&gt;Hooke; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Frazer, Harrison believed that myths could arise as the initial reason a ritual was forgotten or became diluted. As an example, she cited rituals that center on the annual renewal of vegetation. Such rituals often involve a participant who undergoes a staged death and resurrection. Harrison argues that the ritual, although "performed annually, was exclusively initiatory";&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; it was performed on people to initiate them into their roles as full-standing members of society. At this early point, the "god" was simply "the projection of the euphoria produced by the ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; Later, however, this euphoria became personified as a distinct god, and this god later became the god of vegetation, for "just as the initiates symbolically died and were reborn as fully fledged members of society, so the god of vegetation and in turn crops literally died and were reborn."&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; In time, people forgot the ritual's initiatory function and only remembered its status as a commemoration of the Adonis myth.&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt;

==Myth and ritual as non-coextensive==
Not all students of mythology think ritual emerged from myth or myth emerged from ritual: some allow myths and rituals a greater degree of freedom from one another. Although myths and rituals often appear together, these scholars do not think every myth has or had a corresponding ritual, or vice versa.

===Walter Burkert===
The classicist [[Walter Burkert]] believes myths and rituals were originally independent.&lt;ref name="Segal76"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; When myths and rituals do come together, he argues, they do so to reinforce each other. A myth that tells how the gods established a ritual reinforces that ritual by giving it divine status: "Do this because the gods did or do it."&lt;ref name="Segal76"/&gt; A ritual based on a mythical event makes the story of that event more than a mere myth: the myth becomes more important because it narrates an event whose imitation is considered sacred.&lt;ref name="Segal76"/&gt;

Furthermore, Burkert argues that myth and ritual together serve a "socializing function."&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Burkert gives the example of hunting rituals. Hunting, Burkert argues, took on a sacred, ritualistic aura once it ceased to be necessary for survival: "Hunting lost its basic function with the emergence of agriculture some ten thousand years ago. But hunting ritual had become so important that it could not be given up."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1979), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; By performing the ritual of hunting together, an ancient society bonded itself together as a group, and also provided a way for its members to vent their anxieties over their own aggressiveness and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronisław Malinowski===
Like William Smith, the anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] argued in his essay ''Myth in Primitive Psychology'' (1926) that myths function as fictitious accounts of the origin of rituals, thereby providing a justification for those rituals: myth "gives rituals a hoary past and thereby sanctions them."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malinowski also points out that many cultural practices besides ritual have related myths: for Malinowski, "myth and ritual are therefore not coextensive."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt; In other words, not all myths are outgrowths of ritual, and not all rituals are outgrowths of myth.

===Mircea Eliade===
Like Malinowski, the religious scholar [[Mircea Eliade]] thinks one important function of myth is to provide an explanation for ritual. Eliade notes that, in many societies, rituals are considered important precisely because they were established by the mythical gods or heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approvingly quotes Malinowski's claim that a myth is "a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality."&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, "Myth in Primitive Psychology" (1926; reprinted in "Magic, Science and Religion" [New York: 1955], pp. 101, 108), quoted in Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade adds: "Because myth relates the ''gesta'' [deeds] of Supernatural Beings [...] it becomes the exemplary model for all significant human actions."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional man sees mythical figures as models to be imitated. Therefore, societies claim that many of their rituals were established by mythical figures, thereby making the rituals seem all the more important. However, also like Malinowski, Eliade notes that societies use myths to sanction many kinds of activities, not just rituals: "For him, too, then, myth and ritual are not coextensive."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt;

Eliade goes beyond Malinowski by giving an explanation for why myth can confer such an importance upon ritual: according to Eliade, "when [ritually] [re-]enacted myth acts as a time machine, carrying one back to the time of the myth and thereby bringing one closer to god."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt; But, again, for Eliade myth and ritual are not coextensive: the same return to the mythical age can be achieved simply by retelling a myth, without any ritual reenactment. According to Eliade, traditional man sees both myths and rituals as vehicles for "eternal return" to the mythical age (see [[Eternal return (Eliade)]]):
{{quote|"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic [[hero]], or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myths, Dreams and Mysteries," p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recital of myths and enactment of rituals serve a common purpose: they are two different means to remain in sacred time.

The '''New Romantic''' movement was a pop culture movement that originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1970s.  The movement emerged from the nightclub scene in [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] at venues such as Billy's and The Blitz.&lt;ref name=Johnson2009&gt;D. Johnson, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/04/spandau-ballet-new-romantics "Spandau Ballet, the Blitz Kids and the birth of the New Romantics"], ''Observer'', 4 October 2009, retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Romantic movement was characterised by flamboyant, eccentric [[fashion]] inspired by fashion boutiques such as PX in London and [[Kahn and Bell]] in Birmingham. Early adherents of the movement were often referred to by the press by such names as [[Blitz Kids]], New Dandies and Romantic Rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapersofthe80s.com/blitz-kids/ |title=BLITZ KIDS, Shapers of the 80s |publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8&gt;T. Cateforis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MVrM3zKrHQC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s''] (University of Michigan Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-472-03470-7}}, pp. 47–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[David Bowie]], [[Marc Bolan]] and [[Roxy Music]], it developed [[glam rock]] and historical fashions, gaining its name from the styles of the early [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]. Several music acts at the start of the 1980s adopted the style of the movement and became known to epitomise it within the music and mainstream press, including [[Steve Strange]] (of [[Visage (band)|Visage]]), [[Duran Duran]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Classix Nouveaux]] and [[Boy George]] (of [[Culture Club]]). [[Ultravox]] were also often identified as New Romantics by the press although they did not exhibit the same visual styles of the movement, despite their link to the band Visage.{{Ref|UltraVisage}}  [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Adam and the Ants]] were also labeled as New Romantic artists by the press, although both repudiated this and neither had any direct connection to the original scene.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt; A number of these bands adopted [[synthesizer]]s and helped to develop [[synth-pop]] in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK, and then, via [[MTV]], play a major part in the [[Second British Invasion]] of the U.S. charts.

By the end of 1981, the original movement had largely dissipated&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; and, although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived [[romo]] movement.

==Characteristics==
The New Romantic movement is sometimes seen as a reaction to punk,&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p132&gt;S. Borthwick and R. Moy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4bmVbNSnk4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+duran&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=lFgrTsbUK9S78gOOvZ3mCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6wEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20duran&amp;f=false ''Popular Music Genres: an Introduction''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7486-1745-0}}, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and was heavily influenced by former [[glam rock]] stars of the 1970s such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Roxy Music]].&lt;ref name=Buckley2005p318&gt;D.

Evans, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mDnc4apw_0C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22new+romantic%22+blitz&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=uyotTun_FsiZhQfn17iqCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20romantic%22%20blitz&amp;f=false ''Remember the 80s: Now That's What I Call Nostagia!''] (London: Anova Books, 2009), {{ISBN|1-906032-12-2}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes often dressed in counter-sexual or [[androgyny|androgynous]] clothing and wore cosmetics such as [[eyeliner]] and [[lipstick]], partly derived from earlier punk fashions.&lt;ref name=Steer2009p.37/&gt; This "[[gender bending]]" was particularly evident in figures such as [[Boy George]] of [[Culture Club]] and [[Marilyn (singer)|Marilyn]] (Peter Robinson).&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p132/&gt;

Fashion was based on varied looks inspired by [[Romanticism|historical romantic themes]], including frilly [[fop]] [[Poet shirt|shirts]] in the style of the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period,&lt;ref name=Steer2009p.37&gt;D. C. Steer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgU5OQuHTRcC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=androgyny+%22new+romantic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WIUtTuD4CsKp8QOMzpiMDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The 1980s and 1990s''] (Infobase Publishing, 2009), {{ISBN|1-60413-386-4}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian constructivism]], [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], French [[Incroyables and Merveilleuses|Incroyables]] and 1930s' [[Cabaret]], Hollywood [[Actress|starlets]], [[Puritan]]s and the [[Pierrot|Pierrot clown]], with any look being possible if it was adapted to be unusual and striking.&lt;ref name=Steele2010p525&gt;V.

New Romantic looks were propagated from fashion designer Helen Robinson's Covent Garden shop PX,&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; began to influence major collections and were spread, with a delay, through reviews of what was being worn in clubs via magazines including ''[[i-D]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.&lt;ref name=Steele2010p525/&gt; The emergence of the New Romantic movement into the mainstream coincided with [[Vivienne Westwood]]'s unveiling of her "pirate collection", which was promoted by [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Adam and the Ants]], who were managed by her then partner [[Malcolm McLaren]].&lt;ref&gt;R. O'Byrne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BpOn6lJ68OkC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=vivienne+westwood+new+romantic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kn8sTpvJFYi78gPJ7cmSDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD0Q6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vivienne%20westwood%20new%20romantic&amp;f=false Style City: How London Became a Fashion Capital] (London: Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2895-7}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the post-punk Adam Ant himself has always denied being a New Romantic, and reiterated this in 2012.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead2012&gt;D.

The band [[Japan (band)|Japan]] also refuted any connection with the New Romantic movement, having adopted an androgynous look incorporating make-up ever since their inception in the mid-1970s at the tail-end of the glam rock era, many years before the New Romantic movement began. In an October 1981 interview, vocalist [[David Sylvian]] commented "There's a period going past at the moment that may make us look as though we're in fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Rimmer, Dave. Japanese Boys (an interview with David Sylvian and Mick Karn). Smash Hits. Volume 3, issue 22, pages 42–43, October 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, he stated "I don't like to be associated with them (New Romantics). The attitudes are so very different." Of Japan's fashion sense, Sylvian said "For them (New Romantics), fancy dress is a costume. But ours is a way of life. We look and dress this way every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author-link=| title=Rolling Stone Random Notes| newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News| publication-place=Tuscaloosa, AL| date=17 July 1981| page=6| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ricdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R6UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3175,3968351&amp;dq=japan+sylvian&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the electronic duo [[Soft Cell]] also denied any connection to the New Romantic scene. In an interview published in January 1984, keyboardist [[David Ball (musician)|Dave Ball]] reflected back on their first year of success (1981) and stated "At this time we were linked to the whole New Romantics thing, but we were never a part of that. It was just a trendy London club thing with Steve Strange."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Peter. ''Soft Cell: That Was Then But This Is Now'' (an interview with Marc Almond and Dave Ball). ''Smash Hits''. Volume 6, issue 1, page 6, January 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

While some contemporary bands, particularly those of the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska revival, dealt with issues of unemployment and urban decay, New Romantics adopted an escapist and aspirational stance.&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005p326&amp;410&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 326 and 410.&lt;/ref&gt; With its interest in design, marketing and image, the movement has been seen by some as an acceptance of [[Thatcherism]] and style commentator [[Peter York]] even suggested that it was aligned with the [[New Right]].&lt;ref name=Borthwick&amp;Moy2004p124&gt;S.

==Names==
In its early stages the movement was known by a large number of names, including "new dandies", "romantic rebels", "peacock punk", "the now crowd", "the futurists", "the cult with no name"&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"/&gt; and eventually as the "Blitz Kids". As the scene moved beyond a single club the media settled on the name New Romantics.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2011pp47-8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1983p119&gt;T.

Steve Strange worked as the club's doorman and Egan was the [[disk jockey|DJ]] at the Blitz. The club became known for its exclusive door policy and strict dress code. Strange would frequently deny potential patrons admission because he felt that they were not costumed creatively or subversively enough to blend in with those inside the club. In a highly publicised incident, [[Mick Jagger]] tried to enter the club while under the influence of alcohol, but was denied entry by Strange.&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;S.

While still at Billy's, Strange and Egan joined [[Billy Currie]] and [[Midge Ure]] of [[Ultravox]] to form the band [[Visage (band)|Visage]]. Before forming Culture Club, Boy George and Marilyn worked as [[cloakroom]] attendants at the Blitz.&lt;ref&gt;R.

In Birmingham the origins of the New Romantic movement lay in the opening in 1975 of the [[Hurst Street, Birmingham|Hurst Street]] shop of the fashion designers [[Kahn and Bell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rimmer|first=Dave|year=2003|title=New Romantics: The Look|publication-place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|pages=105–106|isbn=0711993963}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose elaborate and theatrical designs brought together futuristic visual elements and influences as diverse as Egyptian, African and Far Eastern art,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1175728/bustier/|title=Bustier|accessdate=30 June 2013|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would largely define the movement's look.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Nick|last=Rhodes|title=How we opened the door to the 1980s|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3651745/How-we-opened-the-door-to-the-1980s.html|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=22 April 2006|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977 a small scene featuring Jane Kahn and Patti Bell themselves, [[Martin Degville]], [[Boy George]] and Patrick Lilley had emerged in pubs such as The Crown and clubs such as Romulus and Barbarella's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rimmer|first=Dave|year=2003|title=New Romantics: The Look|publication-place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|pages=100–102|isbn=0711993963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles of music===
{{Main|Synthpop}}
Many bands that emerged from the New Romantic movement became closely associated with the use of [[synthesizer]]s to create [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]]. This synthpop was prefigured in the 1960s and 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]] [[art rock]], [[disco]], the "[[Kraut rock]]" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]], the three albums made by Bowie with [[Brian Eno]] in his "Berlin period", and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s early albums.

After the breakthrough of [[Tubeway Army]] and [[Gary Numan]] in the [[British Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound and they came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s. Bands that emerged from the New Romantic scene and adopted synthpop included [[Duran Duran]], [[Visage (band)|Visage]], and [[Spandau Ballet]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp334-5&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 334–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early synthpop has been described as "eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing", using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop.&lt;ref name=AMsynthpop&gt;{{Citation |last = |title = Synth pop |journal = Allmusic |date = |url = {{Allmusic |class=explore |id=style/d18 |pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5x6RaN2Dj?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/synth-pop-d18| archivedate =10 March 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Duran Duran, who emerged from the Birmingham scene, have been credited with incorporating a dance-orientated [[rhythm section]] into synthpop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles.&lt;ref name=AMsynthpop/&gt;

Of groups associated with the New Romantic movement, Culture Club avoided a total reliance on synthesizers, producing a sound that combined elements of [[Motown]], the [[Philly sound]] and [[lovers rock]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp412-3&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam and the Ants]] utilised the African influenced rhythms of the "Burundi beat".&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005pp306-7&amp;311&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, pp. 306–7 and 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second British invasion===
{{Main|Second British Invasion}}
In the US the cable music channel [[MTV]] reached the media capitals of New York City and Los Angeles in 1982.&lt;ref name=Cateforis2009&gt;{{Citation|author=T.

They would be followed by a large number of acts, many of them employing synthpop sounds, over the next three years, with Duran Duran's glossy videos symbolising the power of MTV and this [[Second British Invasion]]. The switch to a "[[New Music (music industry)|New Music]]" format in US radio stations was also significant in the success of British bands.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt;

This 80s invasion had been prefigured in May 1981 when the first New Romantic synthpop group [[Spandau Ballet]], house-band of London’s Blitz club, had flown to New York City to stage not only a live gig but a fashion show by the Axiom collective of designers, who included [[Sade Adu]]. These former Blitz Kids, “21 in number and 21 their average age”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shapersofthe80s.com/revolution/1981-first-blitz-invasion-of-the-us/|title=First Blitz invasion of the US, Shapers of the 80s |publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; came by invitation of [[Jim Fouratt]] who hosted the event at the Underground club.

During 1983, 30% of the US record sales were from British acts. On 18 July 1983, 18 singles in the top 40, and 6 in the top 10, were by British artists.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine ran an issue which featured [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Boy George]] on the cover of one of its issues, with the caption "Britain Rocks America&amp;nbsp;– Again", while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' would release an "England Swings" issue with Boy George on the cover.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005pp340&amp;342-3"/&gt; In April 1984, 40 of the top 100 singles, and in a May 1985 survey 8 of the top 10 singles, were by acts of British origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1946331.stm |title=UK acts disappear from US charts |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TarnishedGold&gt;Von R.

===Decline and revivals===
[[File:Live Aid at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, PA.jpg|thumb|The [[Live Aid]] stage at the [[JFK Stadium]] in Philadelphia in July 1985, where Duran Duran played, while Ultravox and Spandau Ballet appeared on the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] stage in the UK]]
Music journalist Dave Rimmer considered the [[Live Aid]] concert of July 1985 as the peak for the various acts that rose from the New Romantic scene of the early 80s, commenting that after which "everyone seemed to take hubristic tumbles".&lt;ref&gt;D. Rimmer, ''New Romantics: The Look'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-7119-9396-9}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Reynolds also notes the "[[Do They Know Its Christmas]]" single in late 1984 and Live Aid in 1985 as turning points, with the acts that the movement spawned as having become decadent, with "overripe arrangements and bloated videos" for songs like Duran Duran's "[[Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]" and Culture Club's "[[The War Song]]".&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005p517"&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of acts using synthesisers had led to an anti-synth backlash, with groups including Spandau Ballet, Soft Cell and [[ABC (band)|ABC]] incorporating more conventional influences and instruments into their sounds by 1983.&lt;ref name=Reynolds2005p342&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adam Ant - Parkpop 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Pop star [[Adam Ant]], seen here in 2012, wearing New Romantic-inspired clothing reminiscent of his early 80s period: [[hussar]] jacket, [[pirate shirt]] and leather gloves.]]
An American reaction against European synthpop and "haircut bands" has been seen as beginning in the mid-1980s with the rise of [[heartland rock]] and [[roots rock]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds2005p535"&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the arrival of [[indie rock]] bands, particularly [[The Smiths]], has been seen as marking the end of synth-driven [[new wave music|new wave]] and the beginning of the guitar rock that would come to dominate rock into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =S.

In the mid-1990s, the New Romantic era was the subject of nostalgia-oriented club nights&amp;nbsp;— such as the Human League inspired "Don't You Want Me", and "Planet Earth", a Duran Duran-themed night club whose promoter told ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' "It's more of a celebration than a revival".&lt;ref&gt;S. Langan, "Worst of times", ''The Sunday Times'' 19 Nov 1995; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period it was also an inspiration for the short-lived [[romo]] musical movement. It was championed by ''[[Melody Maker]]'', who proclaimed on its front cover in 1995 that it was a "future pop explosion" that had "executed" Britpop, and including bands [[Orlando (band)|Orlando]], Plastic Fantastic, [[Minty (band)|Minty]], Viva, Sexus, Hollywood and Dex Dexter. None made the British top 75,&lt;ref&gt;D.

The '''New Zealand Maritime Museum Hui Te Anaui A Tangaroa''' is a maritime museum in [[Auckland, New Zealand]]. It is located on Hobson Wharf, adjacent to the [[Viaduct Harbour]] in central Auckland. It houses exhibitions spanning New Zealand's maritime history, from the first [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] explorers and settlers to modern day triumphs at the [[America's Cup]]. Its Maori name is '' 'Te Huiteanaui-A-Tangaroa' '' - holder of the treasures of [[Tangaroa]] (the Sea God).

The museum's founding director was [[T. L. Rodney Wilson]], who from 1989 led fundraising efforts to establish the museum, which opened in 1993, the year the [[America's Cup]] regatta was held in Auckland.&lt;ref name = 'AM'&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum pays tribute to former director|url=https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/about-us/recent-news/2013/museum-pays-tribute-to-former-director|website=Auckland Museum|accessdate=4 January 2016|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tribute to: T.L.Rodney Wilson CNZM|url=http://www.maritimemuseum.co.nz/tribute-tlrodney-wilson-cnzm|website=New Zealand Maritime Museum|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seaworthy ships==

In addition to a number of reconstructed or preserved ships in the building itself, the museum also owns a number of vessels that are normally berthed outside of the museum:&lt;ref name="MUSE"/&gt;

*[[Breeze (ship)|''Breeze'']], 1982 reproduction of a [[brigantine]] for NZ coastal trade
*[[Puke (boat)|''Puke'']], late 19th century steam engine [[Ship's tender|tender]] for coastal and river logging trade
*''[[Rapaki]]'', 1926 [[Crane vessel|floating steam crane]], built in Scotland for the [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton Harbour Board]]
*''[[Ted Ashby]]'', 1993 reproduction of [[ketch]]-rigged [[scow]] typical, late 19th century northern NZ. Ted Ashby has public sailings every day except Monday.

All except ''Rapaki'' can be hired from the museums for sailing excursions or functions. ''Rapaki'' can be entered and explored during normal museum visits. Some personnel from the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] are also at times seconded to the museum to assist with maintenance of the ships and exhibition objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil.nz/visit-the-base/recent-activities/maritime-museum.htm Helping out at the New Zealand National Maritime Museum] (from the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] website.

==Extension==
A NZ$8 million extension to the northern end of the museum was built in the late 2000s to house a permanent exhibition, ''Blue Water, Black Magic'', about Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]].

== Commissions ==
The first documented reference to Pace di Valentino is for two [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] made in 1257.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pace-di-valentino_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=PACE di Valentino in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1265 he received two significant commissions: the first was for a large golden [[chalice]] ("''calicem magnum di auro''") weighing about 11 pounds and a corresponding [[paten]], both of which are now lost; the second was for an elaborate gold-plated silver book cover. These were items not made for daily use, and having received these requests suggests that he was well known and well regarded in his field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other notable works attributed to him include the [[chalice]] of San Atto made {{circa|1270}},&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and numerous figures in the late 13th-century Altar of St. James found the [[Pistoia Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT949&amp;dq=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pace%20di%20valentino%22&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia|last=Kleinhenz|first=Christopher|date=2004-08-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135948801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians suggest that he made the [[reliquary]] of [[Galgano Guidotti|San Galgano]]'s head, now found in Siena's [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Siena)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.operaduomo.siena.it/museo_approfondimento.htm|title=Opa - cattedrale panorama museo cripta battistero oratorio siena|last=21|first=Studio|website=www.operaduomo.siena.it|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is disputed by others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, other extant documents indicate the details of his purchases of gold, silver, pearls, beads, and precious stones for use in his shop, as well as details of payments for works commissioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

He was the first Sienese goldsmith to work for the papal court (under popes [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]], [[Martin IV]], [[Honorius IV]], and [[Boniface VIII]])&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was actively working for Boniface VIII in the region of [[Montefiascone]] until at least 1296.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=cucRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;dq=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Benedetto XI: papa domenicano (1240-1304)|last=Viganò|first=Alberto|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Nerbini|isbn=9788888625430|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influential on other goldsmiths of the following generation, including [[Guccio di Mannaia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pCQ4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=pace+di+valentino+guccio+di+mannaia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ueGqZ7GBo&amp;sig=E9pg1fQgjjWkW4469fZkj4Bd7g0&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4vj6merRAhWDmBoKHSw4A1g4ChDoAQgjMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=pace%20di%20valentino%20guccio%20di%20mannaia&amp;f=false|title=Splendori Di Assisi.

[[File:Albrecht_Dürer_-_Paumgartner-Altar_-_Alte_Pinakothek_München.jpg|thumb|''Paumgartner altarpiece'', oil on wood, 157 cm × 248 cm. [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]]]
[[File:Paumgartner Altar old.jpg|thumb|100 px|The right panel as it appeared before the 1903 restoration]]
The '''''Paumgartner altarpiece''''' (c. 1500) is an early [[triptych]] painting by [[Albrecht Dürer]], commissioned by the Paumgartner family of [[Nuremberg]]. The central panel depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity scene]], while the wings depict [[Saint George]] (left) and [[Saint Eustace]] (right). The saint's faces are [[donor portrait]]s of the brothers Stephan and Lukas Paumgartner, respectively. Other members of the Paumgartner family are depicted as small figures in the center panel.

In 1616 the painting was bought by [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]] and taken to [[Munich]]. There it was altered to suit 17th century tastes. This entailed adding helmets, horses, and landscape backgrounds to the portraits of the saints and painting over the small donor figures in the center panel. These embellishments were removed by restorators in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;''Dürer und Grünewald, Der Frankfurter Heller-Altar'', Bernhard Decker, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFTrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Paumgartner+altar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H84oT5HUL8iZgwelqsjdBA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Paumgartner%20altar&amp;f=false Brief article] from a contemporary periodical about the restoration&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1988, the ''Paumgartner altarpiece'' was one of three paintings at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] that were attacked with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] by the serial art vandal [[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xKyeh1_V7IC&amp;pg=PA283|page=283|title=Albrecht Dürer: a guide to research|author=Jane Campbell Hutchison|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8153-2114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alone suffered at least $12 million worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/22/arts/3-durer-masterpieces-vandalized-with-acid.html 3 Durer Masterpieces Vandalized With Acid.]" ''New York Times'', 22 April 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After 21 years of restoration, it was returned to display in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, John.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6000">A '''philosophical poet''' is an author or scholar who employs [[Poetry|poetic devices, styles, or forms]] to explore subjects common to the field of [[philosophy]]. Their writing often addresses questions related to the meaning of life, the nature of being ([[ontology]]), theories of knowledge and knowing ([[epistemology]]), principles of beauty ([[aesthetics]]), first principles of things ([[metaphysics]]) or the existence of God. Some may make broad philosophical inquires and engage with diverse philosophical topics throughout their poetry, while others may concentrate within one branch of philosophical poetry. For example, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] is considered by some to be both a philosophical poet, in a general sense, as well as a metaphysical poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QbBcPW-JF8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=philosophical+poet+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yv0rOa2M80&amp;sig=gqL4IWFwaFATG3oO3HQlUog55U8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQv5ypgdPMAhWH4IMKHee2DIQ4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophical%2520poet%2520definition&amp;f=false|title=The Early T. S. Eliot and Western Philosophy|last=Habib|first=Rafey|date=1999-06-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521624336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a group discussion may provide fruitful conditions for some to explore philosophical themes, poetry may be seen an alternative entry into philosophical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFogBQAAQBAJ|title=The Philosophy Shop: Ideas, activities and questions to get people, young and old, thinking philosophically|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2012-09-27|publisher=Crown House Publishing|isbn=9781781350614|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children and young writers may find it easier to begin writing philosophical poetry if they start by using poetic styles other than rhyme, such as repetitive form, since rhyme can be distracting and may interfere with the free flow of their philosophical thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFogBQAAQBAJ|title=The Philosophy Shop: Ideas, activities and questions to get people, young and old, thinking philosophically|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2012-09-27|publisher=Crown House Publishing|isbn=9781781350614|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, philosophical poets do eventually develop one preferred form of philosophical verse when it comes to the style of their writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/2012/01/two-philosophical-poets-on-t-s-eliot-and-kay-ryan/|title=Two Philosophical Poets: On T. S. Eliot and Kay Ryan « Kenyon Review Blog|website=www.kenyonreview.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Rumi]] and [[Hafez|Hafiz]] often utilize the single [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] form, while [[Emily Dickinson|Dickinson]] usually adheres to the [[Quatrain|quatrain form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/2012/01/two-philosophical-poets-on-t-s-eliot-and-kay-ryan/|title=Two Philosophical Poets: On T.

'''Posthumanist art''' refers to [[art]] that can only be created in some part through the aid of [[digital technology]]. [[posthumanism|Posthumanist]] art can be either human-conceived, or machine-produced in whole or in part. The extent to which the human element is involved in the creation, whether by direct manipulation of the [[technology]], or by creation of the [[algorithm]] through which the art is created, can vary.

[[File:Thomas Cole - Prometheus Bound - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|450px|''Prometheus Bound'' (1847). Oil on canvas; 163 cm (64 in) x  244 cm (96 in). [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]]. [http://art.famsf.org/thomas-cole/prometheus-bound-199728 1997.28] ]]

'''''Prometheus Bound''''' is an 1847 oil painting by American artist [[Thomas Cole]]. ''Prometheus Bound'' is one of Cole's largest paintings, and like his other major works of the 1840s it was not the result of a commission.  It draws from the ancient Greek tragedy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' by [[Aeschylus]]. In the painting, [[Prometheus]] is chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus in [[Scythia]]. [[Zeus]] has punished him for endowing humans with life, knowledge, and specifically for giving humans fire. Each day a raptor comes to feed on Prometheus's liver, which regrows between visits, making Zeus's punishment even more cruel.

The [[allegorical]] painting is among Cole's last works, but Cole never commented on the theme of the work. Art historians have tentatively linked the bondage of Prometheus to [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] sentiment by reviewing the presentation of the mythical figure in contemporaneous literature. Cole sent it to London for an 1847 exhibit and competition to decorate the Houses of Parliament, and the painting was still in London when he died. It thus received little exhibition in the United States in the 1840s, making its reception (and its theme) difficult to judge.

==Description==

Cole was a [[landscape painter]] who often employed allegory in his works, such as ''[[The Titan's Goblet]]'' and ''[[The Voyage of Life]]''. The story of Prometheus strictly belongs to the genre of [[history painting]]. In ''Prometheus Bound'', the landscape is appropriately desolate; above Prometheus are imposing, snowy mountains and a cold sky. The figure himself blends in with the rocks, a conscious decision of the artist that adds an element of surprise for the viewer when the figure is finally seen; the viewer's surprise emphasizes Prometheus's desperate and desolate situation.&lt;ref&gt;Junker, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon further inspection a vulture is seen lower in the painting, swooping up toward Prometheus. The raptor comes at dawn, when the planet Jupiter (the "morning star") is seen in the sky.&lt;ref&gt; Cole wrote, "The Artist has supposed the time [to] be the dawn of day. Jupiter the Morning Star" in a note for an exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] is the equivalent of Zeus, Prometheus's antagonist symbolically watches over him.

Technically, the rendition of light on snow is very skilled; Cole used a red [[underpaint]] with white to render the mountains. The famous American landscape artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]] wrote in 1876 to Cole's son, "I've always admired greatly the sky of that picture, deeming it the finest morning effect I ever saw painted".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Junker, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

There is no record of Cole commenting on the theme of ''Prometheus Bound''. Art historian Patricia Junker notes that writers and artists often took up the myth of Prometheus in the decades before Cole's painting; they include [[Lord Byron]], [[James Gates Percival]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[James Russell Lowell]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. Prometheus in bondage was seen as having an "indomitable spirit" and could "serve as a potent object lesson for political and social reform".&lt;ref&gt;Junker, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau had recently translated Aeschylus's play, noting in his forward the increasing interest in Prometheus. Percival published an anti-slavery poem called "Prometheus" in 1843, a time when [[slavery]] and [[abolitionism]] were controversial topics in the U.S. It is possible that Cole used the bondage of Prometheus as a comment on slavery, as he saw art as a potential moral influence on society.&lt;ref&gt;Junker (2000) and {{Cite book |title=Ancient Slavery and Abolition: From Hobbes to Hollywood |last=Hall |first=Edith |last2=Alston |first2=Richard |last3=McConnell |first3=Justine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780199574674 |pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and early reception==

Painted toward the end of Cole's life, ''Prometheus Bound'' followed a period in which Cole worked on his ambitious but never-finished painting series ''The Cross and the World''. In this five-part series he had intended to contrast two travellers as they set out from the central image, one on a spiritual and the other a worldly journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Albany Institute of History &amp; Art: 200 Years of Collecting |last=Albany Institute of History and Art |date=1998 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9781555951016 |pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in February 1846, Cole abandoned that project and developed sketches and studies over the next fifteen months for ''Prometheus Bound''. The 1840s saw Cole developing larger, monumental canvases. Confident in his work and not limited in subject by commissions, he conceived his larger paintings as exhibition works. Cole submitted ''Prometheus Bound'' to the 1847 exhibition at [[Westminster Hall]], London, the third in a series of competitions to select art for the [[British Houses of Parliament]]. The competition offered cash prizes, the possibility of a fresco commission, and the chance for recognition in the press through reproductions in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' and [[lithograph]]s by print publishers. However, the painting's subject matter was a poor fit, as the exhibit required any allegorical paintings to relate to the history of Great Britain; and during the exhibition it was "skied"—placed very highly on the wall where viewers might not have seen the details. The painting did not win a prize and received little press attention.&lt;ref name="epic"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Epic in American Culture: Settlement to Reconstruction |last=Phillips |first=Christopher N. |publisher=JHU Press |year=2012 |isbn=9781421404899 |pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To gauge public response, Cole first showed the work at the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts along with the collection of his one-time patron [[Luman Reed]]. It was well received; the ''Literary World'' wrote, "The whole composition produces in the mind of the spectator a feeling of utter loneliness and desertion; which was, unquestionably, the artist's aim. The star of Jupiter is seen above, hovering within sight of his victim, and one feels, in looking at him, as if he were placed there for all time to gloat on the agonies of the tortured Prometheus.... We wish Mr. Cole could find it in his heart and in his way to treat us oftener to his imaginative creations. They give a dignity to art which the mass of modern artists do not seem to appreciate".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Junker, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole's early biographer, Louis Legrand Noble, commented on the painting: 

{{quote|[It] is an image of the physical sublime. Earth and air—dark blue depths of illimitable ether—vasty foundations—mighty summits helmeted with the crystal of eternal winter, glittering under the white cold Jupiter, in the first golden flashes of the day. It is the huge embodiment of that single thought, haunting the universe, {{smallcaps|The Everlasting}}, ... it is almost utter simplicity—one and simple as a roll of thunder. It is the product of a single blow of genius.... 

The failing of the Prometheus—no great, if we choose to drop the name, and call it the Alps, or Andes in the dawn—is its deficiency in moral meaning. The sense of suffering is well nigh hushed in the deep strong voice of visible nature. The passion of the figure ... is almost entirely swept away in the tide of the one mighty expression of the landscape: and would have been so, had that figure been painted by Michael Angelo himself.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Legrand Noble, ''The Life and Works of Thomas Cole''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles Lanman]] included ''Prometheus Bound'' in his ''The Epic Paintings of Thomas Cole'' (1848), praising it as "one of the wildest and most splendid efforts of the painter's pencil ... one of the most truly sublime paintings we have ever seen".&lt;ref name="epic"/&gt;

The painting was still in London when Cole died in 1848. The [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] acquired it in June 1997.

In music, a '''radio edit''' is a modification, typically truncated, intended to make a song more suitable for [[airplay]], whether it be adjusted for length, [[profanity]], subject matter, instrumentation, or form. Radio edits may also be used for commercial single versions, which may be denoted as the ''7" version''.  However, not all "radio edit" tracks are played on radio.

==Editing for time==
Radio edits often shorten a long song in order to make it more commercially viable for radio stations. The normal length for songs played on the radio is 3 to 4 minutes.  Occasionally, the song will simply [[fade (audio engineering)|fade out]] earlier, common on tracks with long instrumental endings. For instance, the radio edit of '[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]' by [[David Bowie]] fades in shortly before the beginning of the third verse and fades out shortly before the vocal [[Ostinato#Vamp|vamping]] at the end of the song. Another example is [[B.o.B]]'s song, "[[Nothin' On You]]" featuring [[Bruno Mars]], whose radio edit skips the first 5 seconds &amp; starts with the 6th second in which Bruno Mars starts singing the first chorus. The second half of the first chorus is sometimes skipped, along with the last 24 seconds which is the normal fade-out part in which [[B.o.B]] says, "Yeah, and that's just how we do it/And I'ma let this ride/[[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]]", and the radio edit ends with the fourth and last chorus with an earlier fade-out. A 3rd example would be the song, "[[The Man (Aloe Blacc song)|The Man]]" by [[Aloe Blacc]], in which the radio edit skips the "I'm the man/Go ahead &amp; tell everybody/What I'm saying ya all" part &amp; the first 10 seconds. Also, the 3rd chorus of the song is shortened. However, many radio edits will also edit out verses, bridges, and interludes, such as the original single edit of "[[Piano Man (song)|Piano Man]]" by [[Billy Joel]] which substitutes the end of the third verse for the ending of the second verse. Another example for this case is [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", where the radio edit cuts the entire "You are the love of my life" part.  Another example would be [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]'s "[[Back That Thang Up]]" where [[Lil' Wayne]]'s outro is faded out in the "wobble de wop" part.

Some songs will be remixed heavily and feature different arrangements than the original longer versions, occasionally even being completely different recordings. A popular example of this is "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" by [[The Beatles]] which is a completely different recording from the version which appears on ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]''. Another example is [[Miley Cyrus]]'s "[[Adore You]]", whose original album version is a slow, quiet version clocking in at 4 minutes &amp; 37 seconds; the radio edit is a completely different version which is a remix done by [[Cedric Gervais]] running at 3 minutes &amp; 36 seconds. Likewise, an attempt at a radio edit for [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s 18-minute epic "[[Alice's Restaurant]]" scrapped the entire monologue that served as the main base of the song's popularity and instead was a 4-minute, three-verse rock and roll song. This also became more prevalent with the rise of the 12" record, as artists like [[New Order (band)|New Order]] started making songs specifically for the format. Many of the 7" mixes aimed for pop radio airplay of their songs feature very different arrangements, such as "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]", or even a completely different recording, such as "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation]]".

Some long songs do not have a radio edit, despite being as long as 5, 6, 7, or 8 minutes in length, presumably due to listener demand from radio stations. Examples of this include the following 10 songs: "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]" (2006) by [[Tool (band)|Tool]] at 7 minutes and 6 seconds, "[[Hey Jude]]" (1968) by [[The Beatles]] at 7 minutes and 11 seconds long,  "[[You're the Voice]]" (1986) by John Farnham at 5 minutes and 4 seconds long, "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" (1971) by [[Led Zeppelin]] at 8 minutes and 3 seconds, "[[One (Metallica song)|One]]" (1989) by [[Metallica]] at 7 minutes and 24 seconds, "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" (1971) by Don McLean with a length of 8 minutes and 32 seconds, "[[Me &amp; My Brother|Georgia Dome]]" (2004) by [[Ying Yang Twins]] (which actually has a radio edit but removing profanity &amp; not shortening it) at 6 minutes and 6 seconds, "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" (1965) by [[Bob Dylan]] at 6 minutes &amp; 13 seconds, "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]" (1975) by [[Elton John]] at 6 minutes &amp; 45 seconds, and "[[Again (Fetty Wap song)|Again]]" (2015) by [[Fetty Wap]] at 5 minutes and 13 seconds. The idea of extended songs receiving airplay on commercial radio was extremely rare until the birth of [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive radio]] in the mid-1960s; most rock music formats descend from progressive radio, and as such, rock songs tend to be played at their longer original length than songs of other formats.

On rare occasions, a radio edit might be longer than the original album version. This may occur when the song is edited for form, such as in the cases of "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" by [[Radiohead (band)|Radiohead]], "[[2 On]]" by [[Tinashe]], and "[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]" by [[Lit (band)|Lit]]. "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]"'s radio edit has a 4-second drumstick count off before the regular first second, "[[2 On]]" repeats part of the chorus 1 more time than it does on the normal version, and [[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]'s radio edit adds the chorus between the first and second verses. Some radio edits lengthen some parts of the song while shortening others. For example, the radio edit of "[[Thinking Out Loud]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] has a 6-second introduction before the first verse but later in the song cuts from the end of the second verse to the beginning of the last chorus, omitting the second chorus and the guitar solo. Different radio stations may edit songs differently for length; an example is "[[Uptown Funk]]" by [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. Some radio stations cut the bridge and outro, some shorten the hooks and others go from the second chorus to the outro.

The syndicated radio format "QuickHitz", notably adopted by the [[Calgary]] radio station [[CKMP-FM]] in August 2014, utilizes even shorter edits of songs, from 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes in length.&lt;ref name=fp-ampquickhitz&gt;{{cite news|title=This Calgary radio station has started cutting songs in half so listeners don’t get bored|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/08/01/quickhitz-calgary-amp/|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=Financial Post|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ri-ampcalgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Amp Radio Calgary relaunches with QuickHitz|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89494/amp-radio-calgary-prepping-relaunch/|website=RadioInsight|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editing for content==

{{Listen |filename=Lily Allen Fuck You radio edit.ogg |title=Lily Allen, Fuck You (radio edit) |description=The radio edit version of [[Fuck You (Lily Allen song)|Fuck You]] by Lily Allen uses sound effects in place of the word 'Fuck' |pos=right}}

Radio edits often come with any necessary [[censorship]] done to conform to decency standards imposed by government agencies, such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the [[United States]], the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] in [[Canada]], the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] in [[Australia]], and [[Ofcom]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The offending words may be silenced, reversed, distorted, or replaced by a [[Bleep censor|tone]] or sound effect. The edits may come from the record label itself, [[mass media|broadcasters]] at the corporate level before the song is sent for airplay to their stations, or in rarer cases, at a radio station itself depending on local standards. 

Some individual stations may be more lenient with words that tread the broadcast-appropriate line, depending on their management and programming format; for instance a [[rhythmic AC]], [[classic hits]], [[adult contemporary]] or [[urban contemporary]] station may indeed make several radio edits to a song to appeal to a broad base of listeners, while a [[rhythmic contemporary]], [[modern rock]] or [[hip-hop]]-focused station might be more apt to have a light hand in their radio edits to appeal both to listeners and artists who would be favorable to the station's reputation. Some edits might even be done for promotional reasons; for instance a song that mentions a city's name or a certain radio station might see a special 'station cut' where the station and its community are mentioned in the song (as heard in [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]", which has a reference to Nebraska that is easily substituted with another region, state or city; similarly [[Sia (musician)|Sia]]'s "[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]" is sometimes edited to replace the line "turn the radio on" with "...turn [station name] on" to promote the radio station on which the song is playing).

One example would be "[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]" by [[Taio Cruz]], replacing the word, "fuck" with a sound effect. Another example is "[[Talk Dirty (Jason Derulo song)|Talk Dirty]]" by [[Jason Derulo]] featuring [[2 Chainz]], in which the radio edit omits 3 of the words present in the song: "penis", "sex", &amp; "pussy". "Penis" is replaced with an elephant sound effect, "sex" is replaced by an echo of the word "oral" that precedes it in the standard album version from ''[[Tattoos (album)|Tattoos]]'' &amp; ''[[Talk Dirty (album)|Talk Dirty]]'', &amp; "pussy" is replaced with a sound effect of a cat meowing. Occasionally, the song may be re-recorded with different lyrics, ranging from just the replacement of one line being re-recorded, like [[James Blunt]]'s "[[You're Beautiful]]," which replaces "fucking high" with "flying high" in the second verse, to the entire song be completely changed, such as [[D12]]'s "[[Purple Hills]]", which replaces profanity, drug references, and other inappropriate lyrics from the original "[[Purple Pills]]". Another example of the first type (one-line replacement) is [[The Black Eyed Peas]] song "[[Let's Get It Started]]", whose original title was "Let's Get Retarded" but was changed to make it suitable for radio play. [[Sean Kingston]]'s "[[Beautiful Girls (Sean Kingston song)|Beautiful Girls]]", in some radio edits, changed "You got me suicidal" to "in denial". The whole chorus of [[Cee Lo Green]]'s "Fuck You" substituted the word "Fuck" with "Forget", thus changing the title to "[[Fuck You (Cee Lo Green song)|Forget You]]" on the radio edit. In [[Bruno Mars]]' song "[[That's What I Like (Bruno Mars song)|That's What I Like]]", as played on ''[[The Steve Harvey Morning Show]]'', "You and your ass invited" is replaced by an instrumental version; the same occurs in the line, "Sex by the fire at night".

Radio edits may have more or fewer words edited than the "clean version", because of the stations' or agencies' standards.  An "amended" radio edit which only removes the major profanities while keeping the small profanities can be produced for some stations that allow small profanities (e.g. "[[You're Going Down]]" by [[Sick Puppies]] and "[[Bad Girlfriend]]" by [[Theory of a Deadman]]) whereas a "dirty" radio edit preserving the offensive language but maintaining the shorter play time may be produced, which may be aimed at club play, nighttime radio, and non-terrestrial radio stations. [[Kid Rock]] wrote the term "radio edit" into two of his songs, both of which are the same on radio and album versions. After two million copies of Michael Jackson's "[[They Don't Care About Us]]" had already been shipped, the lyrics of the original track with the words "Jew me" and "Kike me" were replaced with "do me" and "strike me" due to its controversial anti-Semitic references. Radio edit versions of the track remained with the original version until the edited version was pressed and released. An example occurs in [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", where the line, "P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face" is misheard as, "P-p-p-poker face, p-p-fuck her face".  Some radio stations repeated the word "poker" from the first part of the line, while others played the original version.  A promotional CD single is available containing both of these versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Lady-Gaga-Poker-Face/release/11549829|title=Lady Gaga - Poker Face|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edited version is available on the compilation ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 31 (U.S. series)|Now 31]]'' in the US.

The '''Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra''' ({{lang-sv|Kungliga Filharmonikerna}} or {{lang|sv|Kungliga Filharmoniska Orkestern}}, literal translations, "Royal Philharmonic" or "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra"&lt;ref&gt;In Swedish, "Stockholm" is not included in the orchestra's title. The English version of the orchestra's name includes "Stockholm" to distinguish this orchestra from the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Swedish orchestra based in [[Stockholm]].  

The orchestra was founded in 1902 as the '''Stockholm Concert Society''' (''Stockholms Konsertföreningens orkester''). It became a permanent ensemble in 1914. Since 1926, it has been based at [[Stockholm Concert Hall]] (Konserthuset). Starting in 1937, Radiotjänst (now [[Swedish Radio]]) utilized the orchestra as its main broadcast orchestra, in lieu of having its own in-house orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Joseph E., "European Radio Orchestras. II" (October 1955).  ''The Musical Times'', '''96''' (1352): pp. 525-527.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, it was renamed the '''Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra''' (''Stockholms Filharmoniska Orkester''). In 1992 it acquired its present name, with patronage from the [[Swedish royal family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Daniel J.

[[Georg Schnéevoigt]] was the first principal conductor of the orchestra, from 1915 to 1924. Its current principal conductor is [[Sakari Oramo]], since 2008, with an initial contract of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Vivien Schweitzer | title=Sakari Oramo to Succeed Alan Gilbert at Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/4259.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=31 March 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Oramo's contract with the orchestra was extended until 2015.

The orchestra participates annually in the [[Nobel Prize]] ceremonies and the [[Polar Prize]] for music celebrations. It also holds two annual festivals at its home, the Stockholm Concert Hall, namely the Stockholm International Composer Festival and Composer Weekend in May, focusing on a contemporary Swedish composer.

The '''Symphony No. 1''' "La nuit des tropiques" (lit. Night of the Tropics), D. 104 (RO 255), is [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]]'s first and most well-known [[symphony]].

==Background==
The symphony was probably completed in 1858; the first movement, sometimes subtitled ''La nuit des tropiques'', was premiered in [[Havana]] during the winter of the following year. Fourteen months later, the full symphony, with the second movement, "Une Fête sous les tropiques" (lit. A day in the tropics), was performed at one of Gottschalk's "monster concerts" with an orchestra of over 600 players, inspired by [[Berlioz]]'s similar performance venues.&lt;ref name="Louis Moreau Gottschalk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.gottschalk-pianist.com/gotts2_b2.php|website=Louis Moreau Gottschalk|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript survived in Havana until 1932, when it was stolen, only to reappear in a [[New York Public Library]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Reel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reel|first1=James|title=Symphony No. 1: "La nuit des tropiques" (Night in the Tropics), for orchestra, D. 104 (RO 255)|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/symphony-no-1-la-nuit-des-tropiques-night-in-the-tropics-for-orchestra-d-104-ro-255-mc0002658241|website=AllMusic|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first premiere in the US was not until 5 May 1955, when [[Howard Shanet]] conducted the [[Columbia University]] Orchestra with his own arrangement of the score for a smaller orchestra.&lt;ref name="NYPhil"&gt;{{cite web|title=1976 May 21 / Subscription Season / Kostelanetz|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/512baeaa-2231-4eaf-8ae7-b8bff9e63457/fullview#page/2/mode/2up|website=NYPhil|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was first recorded in 1971, with an edition by [[Igor Buketoff]] that called for a total of only 150 players, including a full symphony orchestra, an extra band, and many [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]] percussion instruments.&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholas|first1=Jeremy|title=Symphony No 1 'La nuit des tropiques', RO5|url=http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/tw.asp?w=W3767|website=Hyperion Records|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The symphony is written in two movements:
#Andante
#Allegro moderato
The first movement, a sublime "divine tropical sunset-with-storm," begins and ends with strings, building into an agitated section, where the winds and brass support them before coming back to the opening phrases.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horowitz|first1=Joseph|title=Tracing The Spirit Of The Early American Symphony|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2013/07/11/201231850/tracing-the-spirit-of-the-early-american-symphony#|website=NPR|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered more "European" than the second movement, which historically is probably the first orchestral setting of a [[samba]].&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt; Forty-four measures from the end of the second movement are missing, most likely for the orchestra to improvise in a jazz-like manner.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Richard|title=Gottschalk: Orchestral Works|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559320&amp;catNum=559320&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English|website=Naxos|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical performance takes approximately 20 minutes.

'''''The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins''''' is a children's book, written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and published by [[Vanguard Press]] in 1938. Unlike the majority of Geisel's books, it is written in [[prose]] rather than [[rhyming]] and [[meter (poetry)|metered verse]]. Geisel, who collected hats, got the idea for the story on a commuter train from New York to New England while he was sitting behind a businessman wearing a hat; the passenger was so stiff and formal that Geisel idly wondered what would happen if Geisel took his hat and threw it out the window. Geisel concluded that the man was so "stuffy" that he would just grow a new one.

==Plot summary==
Set in [[feudal times]], the story begins in the Kingdom of Didd, when King Derwin is riding through a street past peasant protagonist Bartholomew Cubbins. Ordered to remove his hat, according to the laws, Bartholomew does so, but another hat mysteriously appears; when he attempts to remove this one, yet another one appears; as this continues, the hats begin to grow in extravagance and beauty from the 451st hat onwards. Ultimately the 500th hat, studded with massive gems and gilding, leaves Bartholomew's head bare. Stunned by the beauty of the hat, King Derwin grants him reprieve and trades him 500 gold coins for the 500th hat.

==Reception==
The book received positive reviews from critics. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer called the book "a lovely bit of tomfoolery which keeps up the suspense and surprise until the end."&lt;ref name="Morgan89"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; ''Booklist'', which had criticized Geisel's previous book, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'', for containing only enough material for one comic strip, praised ''The 500 Hats'' as "a brand-new idea, developed into a complete tale, not too long, not too short, just right. Somewhere between the Sunday supplements and the [[Brothers Grimm]], Dr. Seuss has produced a picture book combining features of both."&lt;ref name="Morgan89"/&gt; Alexander Laing, who had worked with Geisel on the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' humor magazine, wrote in his review of the book in the ''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine'', "His several other occupations, madly fascinating as they are, may have been only preludes to a discovery of his proper vocation. That he is a rare and loopy genius has been common knowledge from an early epoch of his undergrad troubles. It now becomes plain that his is the self-consistent, happy madness beloved by children. I do not see what is to prevent him from becoming the Grimm of our times."&lt;ref name="Morgan89"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
* Not long after publication, the story was adapted for an album issued by RCA Victor (Y-339). Narrated by Paul Wing, the audio adaptation had a running time of 13 minutes and 37 seconds. The dramatization featured music and sound effects on two 10" 78rpm records in a bi-fold sleeve. This recording was played in elementary school classrooms during the early 1940s. 
*Geisel wrote the script for the 1943 [[Puppetoon]] short of the same name for [[Paramount Pictures]], which was produced by [[George Pal]]. It also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short (Cartoon).&lt;ref&gt;http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1414808197185{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035602/fullcredits?ref_=ttrel_sa_1&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the book's illustrations, in which Cubbins' hats were all the same one, the hats in the film were of many different kinds.
*Minnesota's [[Children's Theatre Company]] produced a version of ''The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins'' for the stage in 1973, and says this was the first theater adaptation of a Dr. Seuss work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenstheatre.org/about-us/newsfeed/588-ctc-and-the-seuss-connection Children's Theatre Company and the Seuss Connection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
The characters of Bartholomew and King Derwin returned a decade later in ''[[Bartholomew and the Oobleck]]''.

'''''The Book of Mirdad''''' is an allegorical book of philosophy by Lebanese author [[Mikha'il Na'ima]]. The book was first published in Lebanon in 1948 and was initially written in English, with Na'ima later translating it into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Mikhail Naimy: Poet of Meditative Vision|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|date=July 1993|volume= 24|issue= 2|page=175|doi=10.1163/157006493x00041|jstor=4183302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima initially sought to have the book published in London, where it was rejected for "[advancing] a religion with 'a new dogma'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matar|first=Nabil I.|title=Adam and the Serpent: Notes on the Theology of Mikhail Naimy|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|year=1980|volume= 11|pages=56–61|doi=10.1163/157006480x00045|jstor=4183028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the book was adapted into a three-act play by Padukone Ramanand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramanand|first=Padukone|title=Mirdad: Mikhail Naimy's Famous Work 'The Book of Mirdad' Made Into a Play in Three Acts|year=1973|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mirdad_Mikhail_Naimy_s_Famous_Work_The_B.html?id=DuHNiWmguwEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is presented as a series of dialogues between Mirdad, the abbot of a monastery, and his disciples. ''The Book of Mirdad'' draws on a variety of philosophies, including that of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Sufi Islam]]. Through the allegories in the book presented by Mirdad, Na'ima presents several themes and calls for the unity of different people groups in universal love, as well as criticizing materialism and empty religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aida Imangulieva|title=Gibran, Rihani &amp; Naimy: East-West Interactions in Early Twentieth-Century Arab Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWH62rLHcg8C&amp;pg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Anqa Publishing|isbn=978-1-905937-27-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirdad's dialogs gives out teachings which show us how it is possible to transform our consciousness and uncover the God within, by dissolving our sense of duality. The Book of Mirdad is ranked among the great religious classics of the twentieth century and a must have constant companion of any spiritual seeker.

A reviewer for ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' praised the book, citing Na'ima's "power of enthusiasm and persuasion" as a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaligero|first=Massimo|title=Review: The Book of Mirdad, A Lighthouse and a Haven by Mikhail Naimy|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=March 1960|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages=54–55|jstor=29754226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian mystic [[Rajneesh|Osho]] mentioned ''The Book of Mirdad'' in his book ''A Song Without Words'', saying that it "can be of immense help if you don't expect, and it is a book worth reading thousands of times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osho|title=A Song Without Words|year=2006|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=8171827357|pages=130, 140, 143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii6_XQlvv3UC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=The+Book+of+Mirdad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OHCoUOnwDorn0QH--ICAAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mirdad is considered a masterpiece of spiritual wisdom to rank alongside [[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]].

The '''Bubble Project''', as proclaimed by its [[manifesto]], aims to counteract corporate [[marketing]] and [[advertising|advertisement]] messages in public spaces.

The project was conceived by [[Ji Lee]], an artist and art director who originally printed 15,000 [[sticker]]s that look like [[speech bubbles]] used in [[comic strips]]. He posts these blank speech bubbles on top of [[Advertising|advertisement]]s throughout [[New York City]] allowing anyone who sees them to write in their comments and thoughts. By filling in the bubbles people engage in the project and transform "the corporate monologue into an open dialogue". After time passes, the comments are photographed and posted on the project's [http://thebubbleproject.com website].

The Bubble Project has quickly gained popularity and independent efforts have sprung up in other parts of the world in countries such as [[Italy]] or [[Argentina]].

On June 1, 2006, a [http://talkbackbook.com book] written by Lee himself was released. It explains the whole idea behind the project and shows the best pictures taken in the first 4 years, showing the results of the project.

'''''The Holy Kinship''''' is a circa 1495 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting of [[Holy Kinship]] by the workshop of the renaissance artist [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/58546 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Holy Kinship'' shows the Virgin and Child in the left center with Saint Elizabeth and [[John the Baptist]] slightly more prominently positioned center right.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The "kinship" members have been further identified as Saint Anne with a book on the left with her husband Joachim behind her and behind him [[Saint Joseph]] holding a lily towards his wife as a gesture of the immaculate conception. Three young cousins of the infants, the later disciples Simon, Jacob and John, pour wine into a chalice in the centre of the painting which is a reference to the [[Eucharist]], and beyond them a sculpture of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac]] on the altar represents God's sacrifice of [[Jesus]]. A young [[Judas]] stands lighting the candles of the choir gate. In the doorways of the choir gate stand the other two former husbands of Saint Anne, the fathers of the other two Marias who are positioned behind St. Elisabeth.

==Provenance==
This painting is a former altarpiece of an unspecified church, though it is tempting to imagine similarities to the ''Commanderie van Sint-Jan'' where Geertgen is known to have lived and worked: [[Janskerk, Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=Geertgen&gt;''Geertgen was hier: meesterschilder, lekenbroeder en inspirator''’, exhibition catalog Geertgen tot Sint-Jans in De Vishal and Janskerk (18 September – 13 October), Haarlem, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of this painting only goes back to a Brussels sale in 1797 however, and indeed the painting was purchased in 1808 as a work by Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]]. It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-500/catalogus-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting. In his translated ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'', [[Hessel Miedema]] reported that Geertgen died somewhere between 1486 and 1492, while recent [[dendrochronology]], on the other hand, places the painting around 1496 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=Wallert&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2001/11/wallert01.html The Holy Kinship.

This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all ''Highlights of the Rijksmuseum'' catalogs. It was the subject of a mini-exhibition after 17 years were spent 1983-2000 restoring 12 centimeters of water damage at the bottom of the painting.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

{{distinguish|Art theory}}

At the broadest level, a '''theory of art''' aims to shed light on some aspect of the project of defining art or to theorize about the structure of our concept of ‘art’ without providing classical definitions, namely definitions formulated in terms of “necessary and sufficient” conditions. 

== Aesthetic response ==

'''Aesthetic response''' or '''functional theories of art''' are in many ways the most intuitive theories of art. At its base, the term "[[aesthetic]]" refers to a type of phenomenal experience and aesthetic definitions identify artworks with artifacts intended to produce aesthetic experiences. Nature can be beautiful and it can produce aesthetic experiences, but nature does not possess the function of producing those experiences. For such a function, an intention is necessary, and thus agency – the artist.

[[Monroe Beardsley]] is commonly associated with aesthetic definitions of art. In Beardsley’s words, something is art just in case it is “either an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic character or (incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of arrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity” (''The aesthetic point of view: selected essays'', 1982, 299). Painters arrange “conditions” in the paint/canvas medium, and dancers arrange the “conditions” of their bodily medium, for example. According to Beardsley’s first disjunct, art has an intended aesthetic function, but not all artworks succeed in producing aesthetic experiences. The second disjunct allows for artworks that were intended to have this capacity, but failed at it (bad art).

[[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] is the paradigmatic counterexample to aesthetic definitions of art. Such works are said to be counterexamples because they are artworks that don't possess an intended aesthetic function. Beardsley replies that either such works are not art or they are “comments on art” (1983): “To classify them [Fountain and the like] as artworks just because they make comments on art would be to classify a lot of dull and sometimes unintelligible magazine articles and newspaper reviews as artworks” (p.25). This response has been widely considered inadequate (REF). It is either question-begging or it relies on an arbitrary distinction between artworks and commentaries on artworks. A great many art theorists today consider aesthetic definitions of art to be extensionally inadequate, primarily because of artworks in the style of Duchamp{{Citation Needed|date=October 2013}}.

==Formalism==
{{main|Formalism (art)}}
The '''formalist theory of art''' asserts that we should focus only on the formal properties of art--the "form" not the "content". Those formal properties might include, for the visual arts, color, shape, and line, and, for the musical arts, rhythm and harmony. Formalists do not deny that works of art might have content, representation, or narrative-rather, they deny that those things are relevant in our appreciation or understanding of art.

==Institutional==

The '''institutional theory of art''' is a theory about the nature of [[art]] that holds that an object can only be(come) art in the context of the [[institution]] known as "the [[artworld]]".

Addressing the issue of what makes, for example, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]" art, or why a pile of [[Brillo]] cartons in a supermarket is not art, whereas [[Andy Warhol]]'s famous ''Brillo Boxes'' (a pile of Brillo carton replicas) is, the art critic and philosopher [[Arthur Danto]] wrote in his 1964 essay "The Artworld":
{{quote|To see something as art requires something the eye cannot descry—an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an artworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danto |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Danto |date=October 1964 |title=The Artworld |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=61 |issue=19 |pages=571–584 |doi=10.2307/2022937}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Robert J. Yanal, Danto's essay, in which he coined the term ''artworld'', outlined the first institutional theory of art.

Versions of the institutional theory were formulated more explicitly by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] in his article "Defining Art" (''American Philosophical Quarterly'', 1969) and his books ''Aesthetics: An Introduction'' (1971) and ''Art and the Aesthetic: An Institutional Analysis'' (1974). An early version of Dickie's institutional theory can be summed up in the following definition of [[work of art]] from ''Aesthetics: An Introduction'':
{{quote|A work of art in the classificatory sense is 1) an artifact 2) on which some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld) has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aesthetics, An Introduction |last=Dickie |first=George |authorlink=George Dickie (philosopher) |year=1971 |publisher=Pegasus |isbn=978-0-672-63500-7 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Dickie has reformulated his theory in several books and articles. Other philosophers of art have criticized his definitions as being circular.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Noël |authorlink=Noël Carroll |editor=Robert J. Yanal |title=Institutions of Art: Reconsiderations of George Dickie's Philosophy |year=1994 |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]] |isbn=978-0-271-01078-6 |page=12 |chapter=Identifying Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==

'''Historical theories of art''' hold that for something to be art, it must bear some relation to existing works of art. The correct extension of ‘art’ at time t (the present) includes all the works at time t-1 and additionally any works created in the elapsed time. For these additional works to be ''art'', they must be similar or relate to those previously established artworks. Such a definition begs the question of where this inherited status originated. That is why historical definitions of art must also include a disjunct for first art: something is art if it possesses a historical relation to previous artworks, or is first art.

The philosopher primarily associated with the historical definition of art is [[Jerrold Levinson]] (1979). For Levinson, "a work of art is a thing intended for regard-as-a-work-of-art: regard in any of the ways works of art existing prior to it have been correctly regarded" (1979, p. 234). Levinson further clarifies that by "intends for" he means: “[M]akes, appropriates or conceives for the purpose of'" (1979, p. 236). Some of these manners for regard (at around the present time) are: to be regarded with full attention, to be regarded contemplatively, to be regarded with special notice to appearance, to be regarded with "emotional openness" (1979, p. 237). If an object isn't intended for regard in any of the established ways, then it isn't art.

==Anti-essentialist==
Some art theorists have proposed that the attempt to define art must be abandoned and have instead urged an '''anti-essentialist theory of art'''. In ‘The Role of Theory in Aesthetics’ (1956), [[Morris Weitz]] famously argues that individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions will never be forthcoming for the concept ‘art’ because it is an “open concept”. Weitz describes open concepts as those whose “conditions of application are emendable and corrigible” (1956, p. 31). In the case of borderline cases of art and ''prima facie'' counterexamples, open concepts “call for some sort of decision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover this, or to close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case and its new property” (p. 31 ital. in original). The question of whether a new artifact is art or not, “is not factual, but rather a decision problem, where the verdict turns on whether or not we enlarge our set of conditions for applying the concept” (p. 32). For Weitz, it is “the very expansive, adventurous character of art, its ever-present changes and novel creations,” which makes the concept impossible to capture in a classical definition (as some static univocal essence).

While anti-essentialism was never formally defeated, it was challenged and the debate over anti-essentialist theories was subsequently swept away by seemingly better essentialist definitions. Commenting after Weitz, Berys Gaut revived anti-essentialism in the philosophy of art with his paper ‘“Art” as a Cluster Concept’ (2000). Cluster concepts are composed of criteria that contribute to art status but are not individually necessary for art status. There is one exception: Artworks are created by agents, and so being an artifact is a necessary property for being an artwork. Gaut (2005) offers a set of ten criteria that contribute to art status:

::(i) possessing positive aesthetic qualities (I employ the notion of positive aesthetic qualities here in a narrow sense, comprising beauty and its subspecies); 
::(ii) being expressive of emotion; 
::(iii) being intellectually challenging; 
::(iv) being formally complex and coherent; 
::(v) having a capacity to convey complex meanings; 
::(vi) exhibiting an individual point of view; 
::(vii) being an exercise of creative imagination; 
::(viii) being an artifact or performance that is the product of a high degree of skill; 
::(ix) belonging to an established artistic form; and 
::(x) being the product of an intention to make a work of art. (274)

Satisfying all ten criteria would be sufficient for art, as might any subset formed by nine criteria (this is a consequence of the fact that none of the ten properties is necessary). For example, consider two of Gaut’s criteria: “possessing aesthetic merit” and “being expressive of emotion” (200, p. 28). Neither of these criteria is necessary for art status, but both are parts of subsets of these ten criteria that are sufficient for art status. Gaut’s definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria to be sufficient for art status, which leads to a highly pluralistic theory of art.

The theory of art is also impacted by a philosophical turn in thinking, not only exemplified by the aesthetics of [[Kant]] but is tied more closely to [[ontology]] and [[metaphysics]] in terms of the reflections of [[Heidegger]] on the essence of modern technology and the implications it has on all beings that are reduced to what he calls 'standing reserve', and it is from this perspective on the question of being that he explored art beyond the history, theory, and criticism of artistic production as embodied for instance in his influential opus: [[The Origin of the Work of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;. This has had also an impact on architectural thinking in its philosophical roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic creation==
Zangwill&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''Aesthetic Creation'', OUP 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the '''aesthetic creation theory of art''' as a theory of “how art comes to be produced” (p. 167) and an “artist-based” theory. Zangwill distinguishes three phases in the production of a work of art:

::[F]irst, there is the insight that by creating certain nonaesthetic properties, certain aesthetic properties will be realized; second, there is the intention to realize the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, as envisaged in the insight; and, third, there is the more or less successful action of realizing the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, an envisaged in the insight and intention. (45)

In the creation of an artwork, the insight plays a causal role in bringing about actions sufficient for realizing particular aesthetic properties. Zangwill does not describe this relation in detail, but only says it is “because of” this insight that the aesthetic properties are created. 

Aesthetic properties are instantiated by nonaesthetic properties that “include physical properties, such as shape and size, and secondary qualities, such as colours or sounds.”(37) Zangwill says that aesthetic properties supervene on the nonaesthetic properties: it is because of the particular nonaesthetic properties it has that the work possesses certain aesthetic properties (and not the other way around).

==What is "art"?==
[[File:Siproeta epaphus Galawebdesign.jpg|thumb|Harmony of colours]]

How best to define the term "art" is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term "art".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Davies, ''Definitions of Art'', Cornell University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in his ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' 1969 "It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident."&lt;ref name="Danto2003"&gt;Arthur Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that vary considerably. Furthermore, it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term "art" has changed several times over the centuries, and has continued to evolve during the 20th century as well.

The main recent sense of the word "art" is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or "[[fine art]]." Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the "finer" things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a [[craft]] instead of art, a suggestion which is highly disputed by many [[Studio Craft|Contemporary Craft]] thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered design instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called [[applied art]]. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', Temple University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Art usually implies no function other than to convey or communicate an idea. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that was not trying to be beautiful could not count as art. The [[cubism|cubists]], [[dada]]ists, [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and many later [[art movement]]s struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to [[Danto]], "Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960's but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well."&lt;ref name="Danto2003"/&gt; Perhaps some notion like "expression" (in [[Benedetto Croce|Croce's]] theories) or "counter-environment" (in [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan's]] theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. [[Brian Massumi]] brought back "beauty" into consideration together with "expression".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression," ''CRCL'', '''24''':3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another view, as important to the philosophy of art as "beauty," is that of the "sublime," elaborated upon in the twentieth century by the [[postmodern]] philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. A further approach, elaborated by André Malraux in works such as ''The Voices of Silence'', is that art is fundamentally a response to a metaphysical question ('Art', he writes, 'is an 'anti-destiny'). Malraux argues that, while art has sometimes been oriented towards beauty and the sublime (principally in post-Renaissance European art) these qualities, as the wider history of art demonstrates, are by no means essential to it.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan. ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps (as in Kennick's theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] fashion (as in [[Morris Weitz|Weitz]] or [[Joseph Beuys|Beuys]]). Another approach is to say that "art" is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This "institutional definition of art" (see also [[Institutional Critique]]) has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider the depiction of a store-bought [[Urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the associations that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. If a poet writes down several lines, intending them as a poem, the very procedure by which it is written makes it a poem. Whereas if a journalist writes exactly the same set of words, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. [[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims in his ''What is art?'' (1897) that what decides whether or not something is art is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). '

Marxist attempts to define art focus on its place in the mode of production, such as in [[Walter Benjamin]]'s essay ''The Author as Producer'',&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Walter, ''Understanding Brecht'', trans. Anna Bostock, Verso Books, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-85984-418-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or its political role in class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjinicolaou, Nicos, ''Art History and Class Struggle'', Pluto Press; 1978. {{ISBN|978-0-904383-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revising some concepts of the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gary Tedman]] defines art in terms of social reproduction of the relations of production on the aesthetic level.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, Gary, Aesthetics &amp; Alienation, Zero Books; 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==What should art be like?==
Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "On Modernist Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dada]]ist [[Tristan Tzara]] on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. "We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits."&lt;ref&gt;Tristan Tzara, [http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4115716 "Sept Manifestes Dada."]&lt;/ref&gt; Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.

==The value of art==
Tolstoy defined art as the following: "Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them." However, this definition is merely a starting point for his theory of art's value. To some extent, the value of art, for Tolstoy, is one with the value of empathy. However, sometimes empathy is not of value. In chapter fifteen of ''What Is Art?'', Tolstoy says that some feelings are good, but others are bad, and so art is only valuable when it generates empathy or shared feeling for good feelings. For example, Tolstoy asserts that empathy for decadent members of the ruling class makes society worse, rather than better. In chapter sixteen, he asserts that the best art is "universal art" that expresses simple and accessible positive feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Gracyk, "Outline of Tolstoy's What Is Art?", [http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/tolstoy.outline.htm course web page].&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument for the value of art, used in the fictional work ''[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'', proceeds that, if some external force presenting imminent destruction of Earth asked humanity what its value was—what should humanity's response be? The argument continues that the only justification humanity could give for its continued existence would be the past creation and continued creation of things like a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt painting or a Bach concerto. The suggestion is that these are the things of value which define humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Adams]], ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever one might think of this claim — and it does seem to undervalue the many other achievements of which human beings have shown themselves capable, both individually and collectively — it is true that art appears to possess a special capacity to endure ("live on") beyond the moment of its birth, in many cases for centuries or millennia. This capacity of art to endure over time — what precisely it is and how it operates — has been widely neglected in modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, [http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/Art-and-Time1-4438-4400-4.htm ''Art and Time''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318222226/http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/Art-and-Time1-4438-4400-4.htm |date=18 March 2013 }} Cambridge Scholars, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thomas William Robertson.jpg|right|frame|Engraving of Tom Robertson]]
'''Thomas William Robertson''' (9 January 1829 – 3 February 1871), usually known professionally as T. W. Robertson, was an English [[dramatist]] and innovative stage director best known for a series of [[realism (arts)|realistic]] or [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] plays produced in London in the 1860s that broke new ground and inspired playwrights such as [[W.S. Gilbert]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark-upon-Trent]], [[Nottinghamshire]], England, Robertson was the oldest son of William Robertson, a provincial actor and manager.  His family was famous for producing actors.  The actress [[Madge Kendal|Margaret (Madge) Robertson]] was his youngest sister.  As a child, Robertson acted in juvenile parts in ''Rob Roy'', ''Pizarro'', ''The Stranger'', "French" parts and eccentric comedy on the Lincoln Circuit and at the Marylebone in London.  He also visited Paris as the stage manager and interpreter for an English company.&lt;ref name=Utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289-301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Never a successful actor himself, he wrote numerous plays, mostly comedies, many of which achieved popularity.  Robertson died at the age of 42 and is buried, as is his wife Elizabeth, at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in [[Stoke Newington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savin|first=Maynard|title=Thomas William Robertson: his plays and stagecraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=jwFeTPO2N5SQOKLjtL0J&amp;ct=result&amp;id=XU0GAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=buried|year=1950|publisher=Brown University|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
As a dramatist, Robertson began with adaptations of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] novels and wrote [[music hall]] songs for comedians.&lt;ref name=Utility/&gt;  He produced a farcical comedy, ''A Night's Adventure'' at London's [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1851, but this did not catch on, and he remained for several more years in the provinces, acting and continuing with play writing and writing for newspapers.  In 1860, he moved to London and worked as an editor, also writing a novel, later dramatised under the title ''Shadow Tree Shaft''.  He also wrote a farce entitled ''A Cantab'', which was played at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] in 1861.  This brought him a reputation among a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] clique of writers, the ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine gang (including [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]], and [[F. C. Burnand]]), but so little profit that he thought of abandoning the profession to become a tobacconist.  Finally, in 1864, he had his first notable playwriting success, ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] with [[Edward Sothern]] in the title role.  Robertson also wrote the libretto to the 1865 [[comic opera]] ''Constance'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]].

Robertson found fame in 1865 with the production of his comedy ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', under the management of [[Squire Bancroft]] and his wife [[Effie Bancroft|Marie (née Wilton)]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The play includes a scene that fictionalized the ''Fun'' gang, who frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Information about the bohemian round tables]&lt;/ref&gt;  This play became regarded as a milestone in Victorian drama because of its realism in sets, costume, acting and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Edgar Pemberton|Pemberton, T. Edgar]]. [https://archive.org/stream/societyandcastee00robeuoft/societyandcastee00robeuoft_djvu.txt ''The English Drama from its Beginning to the Present Day'' – ''Society'' and ''Caste''], D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Publishers Boston USA and London (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Robertson's popular plays, except for ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', were produced by the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.  Other Robertson successes included the domestic dramas ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869), and ''M.P.'' (1870).  He also wrote ''Dreams'' for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], which opened that new theatre in 1868 together with Gilbert's ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]''.  His last play, ''War'', was produced at the [[St. James's Theatre]] in 1871, the year in which he died.  Robertson's plays are still occasionally seen.  For example, ''Ours'' was given a professional production in July 2007 at the [[Finborough Theatre]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/2007/ours.htm Information about the 2007 production of ''Ours'' at the Finborough Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations in realism and directing===
Robertson's plays became known as 'problem plays', because they dealt seriously and sensitively with issues of the day.  In the 1850s and 1860s, Robertson's plays, both in style and substance, were considered revolutionary.  ''Caste'' was about marriage across the class barrier and explored prejudices towards social climbing.&lt;ref name=Cup&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/0-9/19th-century-theatre/ "Cup and Saucer drama,"] 19th Century Theatre, Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://members.tripod.com/FootlightNotes/index.html Information about ''Caste'', especially the 1910 revival.]  Footlight Notes, No. 315, 27 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These plays were notable for their "cup and saucer" realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were realistic, unlike the oversize acting in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s that were popular at the time.&lt;ref name=bruegge&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Vorder Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=2011-05-03 }}, accessed March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, whereas previously a designer would put as many chairs into a dining room scene as there were actors who needed to sit down, Robertson would place on stage as many chairs as would realistically be found in that dining room, even if some were never actually used.  Or, if someone came in from a blizzard, snow would blow in from the doorway.  In ''Ours'', a pudding was made on stage, and this caused a major furore – people were not used to seeing such realistic tasks in a stage setting.  Also, the characters spoke in normal language and dealt with ordinary situations rather than declaiming their lines.&lt;ref name=Cup/&gt;

In addition, the importance of everyday incidents, the revealing of character through apparent "small talk", and the idea that what is not said in the dialogue is as important as what is said are all Robertson trademarks.  Some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson's plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, but many admired the new style of play and new style of acting.  [[George Bernard Shaw]] called Robertson's play ''Caste'' "epoch making" and referred to Robertson's innovations as a "theatrical revolution".  It is now disputed whether Robertson really originated some of his innovations, but ''Society'' and its successors were viewed at the time as something new and, in a quiet way, revolutionary.

The Bancrofts, impressed with Robertson's dedication and skill, gave Robertson unusual artistic freedom to control his scripts and direct (or as it was then called, "stage manage") his plays.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  Before Robertson and [[James Robinson Planché]], star actors generally had control of scripts, and theatre managers had control of casting in the theatre.  Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions - a novel concept at that time.  Robertson directed his own plays and aimed to get rid of the unreal stylisation and bombast of the old [[melodrama]]s.  He did not act in his plays but instead took on the role of a professional director to control the action on stage.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  W. S. Gilbert attended Robertson's rehearsals to learn from the older playwright's use of "stagecraft" and personally directed his own plays and operas based on what he had learned. Gilbert later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why, he invented stage management. It was an unknown art before his time. Formerly, in a conversation scene for instance, you simply brought down two or three chairs, and people sat down and talked, and when the conversation was ended the chairs were replaced. Robertson showed how to give life and variety and nature to the scene, by breaking it up with all sorts of little incidents and delicate by-play. I have been at many of his rehearsals and learnt a great deal from them.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. ''Real Conversations'', 1904, ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These pioneers opened the way for later proponents of realism in drama, such as Shaw, and for modern methods of play production.  Robertson was also a leader in requiring a fee from his managers for every performance of his plays, thus pioneering the modern royalty system.
