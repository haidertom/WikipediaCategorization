{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''abiotic components''' or '''abiotic factors''' are non-living chemical and [[Physical property|physical]] parts of the [[Natural environment|environment]] that affect living [[organism]]s and the functioning of [[ecosystem]]s. Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin all biology. 

Abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living [[Resource (biology)|resources]] that affect living organisms in terms of [[Developmental biology|growth]], [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]], and [[reproduction]].  Resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R.E. 2005. ''The Economy of Nature, 6th edition''. WH Freeman, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, H.A. Mooney, M.C. Chapin, and P. Matson. 2011. Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiotic Factors.tif|thumb|These are different settings on earth that are abiotic factors, which mean they are not living organisms, that contribute to the earth in many different ways.]]
Component degradation of a substance occurs by [[chemical process|chemical]] or [[Physical change|physical process]]es, e.g. [[hydrolysis]].  All non-living components of an ecosystem, such as atmospheric conditions and water resources, are called abiotic components.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. ISO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In biology, abiotic factors can include water, light, radiation, temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmosphere]], and soil. The macroscopic climate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=EoEarth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |year=2010 |last=Hogan |first=C.

Consider the differences in the mechanics of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]], and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants in regulating the influx of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[Calvin-Benson Cycle]] in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage [[photorespiration]], whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate [[PEP Carboxylase]] enzyme to prevent photorespiration, thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chuali|last2=Guo|first2=Longyun|last3=Li|first3=Yixue|last4=Wang|first4=Zhuo|title=Systematic Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants Based on Metabolic Network Analysis|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=2012|volume=6|issue=59|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubisco and C4 Plants|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/066/Rubisco%20and%20C4%20plants.pdf?v=1353967268963|website=RSC: Advancing the Chemical Sciences|publisher=RSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Archea]] require very high temperatures, pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur; this is due to their specialization into extreme conditions. In addition, fungi have also evolved to survive at the temperature, the humidity, and stability of their environment.&lt;ref name=UWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |title=Abiotic Components |publisher=Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, [[University of the Western Cape]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425160041/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/SCI_ED/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there is a significant difference in access in both water and humidity between [[temperate rain forest]]s and [[desert]]s. This difference in water availability causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that survive in these areas. These differences in abiotic components alter the species present both by creating boundaries of what species can survive within the environment, as well as influencing competition between two species. Abiotic factors such as salinity can give one species a competitive advantage over another, creating pressures that lead to speciation and alteration of a species to and from generalist and specialist competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunson|first=William A.|date=November 1991|title=The Role of Abiotic Factors in Community Organization|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/stable/pdf/2462508.pdf|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=138 |issue=5|pages=1067–1091|doi=10.1086/285270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4371">A '''bad date list''' (also known as a '''bad date book''' or '''Ugly Mugs''') circulates details of persons that may pose a threat to sex workers.  Bad date lists can serve as a warning system, so that sex workers can avoid persons who fit descriptions on the list.

Bad date lists contain reports of 'bad dates' or incidents of violent or dangerous clients or other persons, which describe the incident, and frequently provide a description of the person, their vehicle (if applicable) and their phone number (if applicable).

Bad date lists can be handed out to outdoor sex workers.  Reports can be collected by outreach workers who are distributing the list.  Bad Date List websites are also frequently used, mainly by indoor sex workers.  Sometimes information comes from the police or the media.

The first Canadian bad date book was published in Vancouver, Canada by the “Alliance for Safety of Prostitutes” (ASP) in 1983.  The Prostitution Collective in Victoria, Australia developed the first Ugly Mugs Scheme in May 1986, using the term ‘ugly mugs’ to describe punters who become unreasonable and violent.

Many organizations produce a "bad date list" including:

In the [[demolition|controlled demolition]] industry, '''building implosion''' is the strategic placing of [[explosive material]] and timing of its detonation so that a structure collapses on itself in a matter of seconds, minimizing the physical damage to its immediate surroundings.  Despite its terminology, building implosion also includes the controlled demolition of other structures, such as [[bridge]]s, [[Chimney|smokestacks]], [[tower]]s, and [[tunnel]]s.

Building implosion (which reduces to seconds a process which could take months or years to achieve by other methods) typically occurs in urban areas and often involves large landmark structures.

The actual use of the term "implosion" to refer to the destruction of a building is a [[misnomer]]. This had been stated of the destruction of [[1515 Tower]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. "What happens is, you use explosive materials in critical structural connections to allow gravity to bring it down."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/taking-down-1515-tower-no-implosion-not-quite-223838.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Radio Network House implosion.ogv|thumb|left|upright|Implosion of Radio Network House, damaged by the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], in the [[Christchurch Central City]]]]
{{Rquote|right|The term "implosion" was coined by my grandmother back in, I guess, the '60s. It's a more descriptive way to explain what we do than "explosion". There ''are'' {{sic}} a series of small explosions, but the building itself isn't erupting outward. It's actually being pulled in on top of itself. What we're really doing is removing specific support columns within the structure and then cajoling the building in one direction or another, or straight down.|[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html Stacy Loizeaux]|[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]], December 1996}}

The term ''building implosion'' can be misleading to [[laymen]]: The technique is not a true [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] phenomenon. A true implosion usually involves a difference between internal (lower) and external (higher) pressure, or inward and outward forces, that is so large that the structure collapses inward into itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In contrast, building implosion techniques do not rely on the difference between internal and external pressure to collapse a structure. Instead, the goal is to induce a [[progressive collapse]] by weakening or removing critical supports, therefore the building can no longer withstand gravity loads and will fail under its own weight{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Numerous small explosives, strategically placed within the structure, are used to catalyze the collapse. [[Nitroglycerin]], [[dynamite]], or other explosives are used to shatter reinforced concrete supports.  [[Shaped charge|Linear shaped charges]] are used to sever steel supports.  These explosives are progressively detonated on supports throughout the structure. Then, explosives on the lower floors initiate the controlled collapse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

A simple structure like a chimney can be prepared for demolition in less than a day. Larger or more complex structures can take up to six months of preparation to remove internal walls and wrap columns with fabric and fencing before firing the explosives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Historical overview==
[[Image:Buffalo Implode2 2.jpg|thumb|Demolition by controlled explosion in [[Buffalo, New York]]]]
[[File:Demolition of the New Haven Coliseum.gif|thumb|right|The demolition of the [[New Haven Coliseum]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]]]
As part of the [[demolition]] industry, the history of building implosion is tied to the development of [[Explosive material|explosives]] technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One of the earliest documented attempts at building implosion was the 1773 razing of Holy Trinity Cathedral in [[Waterford]], [[Ireland]] with 150 pounds of [[gunpowder]], a huge amount of explosives at the time. The use of [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low velocity explosive]] produced a deafening explosion that instantly reduced the building to rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Dick Grogan | title = Pillars of the church may save the nave | page = 2 | publisher = The Irish Times, City Edition; Home News Section; From the South-East | date = 1997-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th Century saw the erection of&amp;nbsp;— and ultimately the need to demolish&amp;nbsp;— the first [[skyscraper]]s, which had more complicated structures, allowing greater heights.  This led to other considerations in the explosive demolition of buildings, such as worker and spectator safety and limiting collateral damage. Benefiting from the availability of [[dynamite]], a high-velocity explosive based on a stabilized form of [[nitroglycerine]], and borrowing from techniques used in rock-blasting, such as staggered detonation of several small charges, building demolition edged toward efficient building implosion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Following [[World War II]], European demolition experts, faced with huge reconstruction projects in dense urban areas, gathered practical knowledge and experience for bringing down large structures without harming adjacent properties.&lt;ref name=HEDA&gt;
{{cite conference | author = Brent Blanchard | title = A History of Explosive Demolition in America | booktitle = Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique | pages = 27–44 |date=February 2002 | issn = 0732-619X | publisher = International Society of Explosives Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the emergence of a demolition industry that grew and matured during the latter half of the twentieth century.  At the same time, the development of more efficient high-velocity explosives, such as [[RDX]], and non-electrical firing systems combined to make this a period of time in which the building implosion technique was extensively used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Meanwhile, public interest in the spectacle of controlled building explosion also grew.  The October 1994 demolition of the Sears Merchandise Center in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] drew a cheering crowd of 50,000, as well as protesters, bands, and street vendors hawking building implosion memorabilia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}   Evolution in the mastery of controlled demolition led to the world record&lt;ref name="HEDA" /&gt; demolition of the [[Seattle Kingdome]] on March 26, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Controlled Demolition, Inc. | title = Seattle Kingdome demolition | url  = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/sites/default/files/kingdome.mpg | accessdate = 2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Royal Canberra Hospital implosion]] in Canberra, Australia experienced disaster. The main building did not fully disintegrate and had to be manually demolished. Far worse, the explosion was not contained on the site and large pieces of debris were projected towards spectators 500 metres away, in a location considered safe for viewing. A twelve-year-old girl was killed instantly, and nine others were injured. Large fragments of masonry and metal were found 650 metres from the demolition site.&lt;ref name="Coronersintro"&gt;{{cite web | last = Madden (ACT Coroner) | first = Shane G. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1999 | url = http://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/dec/bender/Sect01.htm | archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090609035707/http://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/dec/bender/Sect01.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-06-09 | title = General Chronology and Overview | work = The Bender Coronial Decision | publisher = ACT Magistrates Court and Tribunals (Coroner's Court) | accessdate = 2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 1998, the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition]] became the tallest, and the largest, building ever imploded.

On December 13, 2009, an unfinished 31-story condominium tower, known as the [[Ocean Tower]], was imploded in [[South Padre Island, Texas]]. Construction on the new tower had begun in 2006, but it had been sinking unevenly during construction, halted in 2008, and could not be saved.  It is believed to be one of the tallest reinforced concrete structures ever imploded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5b3_1261953820 LiveLeak.com - Tallest reinforced concrete structure ever imploded] [[liveleak.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/rubble-106263-family-span.html Ocean Tower implodes into pile of rubble] - [[The Brownsville Herald]], December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building implosion has been successfully used at Department of Energy sites such as the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina and the Hanford Site in Washington. The SRS 185-3K or "K" Area Cooling Tower, built in 1992 to cool the water from the K Reactor, was no longer needed when the Cold War ended and was safely demolished by explosive demolition on May 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/21-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20003_185-3K%20Cooling%20Tower%20Demolition%20-%20Final.pdf The Use of Explosives to Demolish the 185-3K Cooling Tower ](D&amp;D KM-IT Best Practice)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hanford Site Buildings 337, 337B, and the 309 Exhaust Stack, built in the early 1970s  and vacated in the mid-2000s due to deteriorating physical condition, were safely razed by explosive demolition on October 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/18-FINAL_337%20Building%20Explosion%20Demolition_BP.pdf Explosive Demolition of Buildings 337, 337B and the 309 Stack at the Hanford’s 300 Area ](D&amp;D KM-IT Best Practice)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Association for Irish Studies''' (L'association canadienne d'études irlandaises)  or CAIS was founded in 1973. Its objective is to promote the study of Irish culture in [[Canada]], and its particular aim is to attract young scholars to the field. It uses conferences, publications and online resources to promote discussion of current ideas relating to Irish studies and culture.

CAIS has members throughout Canada. Others can be found in [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]], Europe, Asia and Australasia.

Among the Association's activities are an annual conference at a university in Canada. These conferences are attended by students, scholars and members of the public.

The Association also publishes the semi-annual ''Canadian Journal of Irish Studies'' and a newsletter.

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, ''Tom Jones'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the [[theatre]] or [[film|cinema]], involves "the illusion of being a human person".&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective [[impersonation]]  by an actor.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chimie ParisTech''' (officially '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (''National Chemical Engineering Institute in Paris''), also known as '''ENSCP''' or '''Chimie Paris'''), founded in 1896 within the [[University of Paris]], is an [[Engineering education|engineering school]] and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University]] specialised in [[Chemistry|chemical science]]. It is located in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].

The students enter the school after highly competitive exams known as the ''[[:fr:Concours Communs Polytechniques|Concours Communs Polytechniques]]'', following at least two years of ''[[classes préparatoires]]''. The school is known as France's most selective chemical engineering college&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccp.scei-concours.fr/sccp.php?page=cpge/statistique/statistique_accueil_cpge.html&amp;onglet=statistiques CCP : un concours pour écoles d'ingénieurs]. Ccp.scei-concours.fr (2013-09-16). Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The school is a research center hosting ten laboratories which conduct high level research in various fields of chemistry.

==History==
The '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' was founded in 1896 by [[Charles Friedel]], a chemist and mineralogist who headed the school until 1899. At the time, the school was called the '''Laboratoire de chimie pratique et industrielle'''. It was located in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] (rue Michelet), where it stayed until 1923.

After the death of Friedel, [[Henri Moissan]] took the reins of the school. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for chemistry in 1906, while he was director. Moissan made student admission subject to competitive exams and renamed the school '''Institut de chimie appliquée''' (Institute of Applied Chemistry).

In 1907, the school began delivering a prestigious masters of engineering. In the same year, Moissan died and a transitional directorate was created. Soon thereafter, Camille Chabrié was named director. The school closed when [[World War I]] started and reopened in 1916. This was also the first year a female student was admitted; the ENSCP was one of the first engineering schools in France to do so.

In 1923, the school moved to its current location, on the rue Pierre et Marie Curie (in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]]). The buildings were designed and built by [[Henri-Paul Nénot]], architect of the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1932, the school became '''l'Institut de Chimie de Paris''' (Paris Institute of Chemistry). Finally, in 1948, it became the '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (ENSCP).

A '''domatium''' (plural: '''domatia''', from the Latin "domus", meaning home) is a tiny chamber produced by plants that houses arthropods.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=O'Dowd |first=Dennis J. |author2=Mary F. Willson |date=June 1991 |title=Associations Between Mites and Leaf Domatia |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=179–182 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90209-G}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ideally domatia differ from [[gall]]s in that they are produced by the plant rather than being induced by their inhabitants, but the distinction is not sharp; the development of many types of domatia is influenced and promoted by the inhabitants. Most domatia are inhabited either by [[mites]] or [[ants]], in what can be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relationship, but other arthropods such as [[thrips]] may take parasitic advantage of the protection offered by this structure. 

Domatia occupied by ants are called '''myrmecodomatia'''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O., The Insect Societies,  Publisher: Belknap Press 1971, {{ISBN|978-0-674-45490-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important class of myrmecodomatia comprise large, hollow spines of certain acacias such as ''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', in which ants of the genera ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' and ''[[Tetraponera]]'' make their nests. Plants that provide myrmecodomatia are called '''[[myrmecophyte]]s'''. The variety of the plants that provide myrmecodomatia, and the ranges of forms of such domatia are considerable. Some plants, such as ''[[Myrmecodia]]'', grow large bulbous structures riddled with channels in which their ants may establish themselves, both for mutual protection and for the nutritive benefit of the ants' wastes.

Often domatia are formed on the lower surface of leaves, at the juncture of the midrib and the veins.  They usually consist of small depressions partly enclosed by leaf tissue or hairs.  Many members of the [[Lauraceae]] family develop leaf domatia.  Domatia are also found in some rainforest tree species in the families [[Alangiaceae]], [[Elaeocarpaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Icacinaceae]], [[Meliaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], [[Sapindaceae]] and [[Simaroubaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative''' is a global initiative which aims to increase awareness of the economic consequences of [[land degradation]] and promote [[sustainable land management]]. The ELD Initiative provides a platform for discussion between stakeholders from the policy, science, and private sectors, and is focused on developing globally relevant data and methodology on the economic benefits of land and land based ecosystems for decision makers. The Initiative highlights the benefits derived from adopting sustainable land management practices and seeks to establish a global economic analyses of land management. The ELD Initiative was co-founded by the Secretariat of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)]], the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development|German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)]], the [[European Commission|European Commission (EC)]] and is hosted by the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH]]. The ELD Secretariat is based in [[Bonn]], Germany.

==Background==
[[Land degradation]] and [[desertification]] threaten people’s livelihood on a global scale. Every year, 20 million hectares of fertile land become degraded and within the last 40 years, around one third of the total agricultural land on earth has become unproductive through degradation processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmz.de/de/publikationen/themen/umwelt/Desertifikation.pdf BMZ on the German Engagement within the UNCCD]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developing country|Less developed countries]] are more vulnerable to desertification and land degradation, as they lack the infrastructure and capital to deal with this threat and implement long-term [[sustainable land management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-Interim_Report_web.pdf ELD Scientific Interim Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Soil on degraded land is less resilient and crops grown on degraded soil produce lower yields. 
Land degradation also negatively influences global [[food security]]: in the next 25 years, global food production might drop by up to 12%. This will lead to an increase in average food prices of up to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unccd.int/Lists/SiteDocumentLibrary/WDCD/DLDD%20Facts.pdf Global Facts and Figures on Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought by UNCCD]&lt;/ref&gt;
Estimates show that the annual costs of land degradation are up to €3.4 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD_Business_Brief.pdf TEEB Interim Report in ELD Business Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; Paired with the growing world population and an increasing demand for alternative land management products such as biofuels land degradation causes poverty, food insecurity, reduced availability of clean water, and increased vulnerability towards [[climate change]] and extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-Interim_Report_web.pdf ELD Scientific Interim Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Land is covered by different [[ecosystem]]s, which can be valued to include all the services they provide to life on earth: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural [[Ecosystem services|services]]. These ecosystem services were estimated, in 2011 to have a global worth of USD 125 trillion/yr. This shows a decrease of USD 20.2 trillion/yr since 1997, caused by land use and management changes [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-main-report_08_web-72dpi_01.pdf .&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[6]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] Sustainable land management practices are not usually costly to take up, and could deliver up to USD 1.4 trillion, merely in crop production, if adopted [http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ELD-Interim-Report-Web-Version4.pdf. .&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[7]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]

Achieving a land degradation neutral world by 2030 is now a stated target in the recently ratified United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG’s), where Land Degradation Neutrality is explicitly outlined in the universally applicable target 15.3. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) COP 12 decisions also explicitly recognizes the need for economic assessments of desertification, sustainable land management, and the resilience of rural areas. The ELD Initiative is in very close alignment and support of these targets in all of its efforts.

==Formation and partner organisations==
In 2010, a scientific foundation was created to promote the issues of sustainable land management and food security and increase public awareness for the importance of productive soils. In October 2011, a [[Memorandum of understanding]] was signed between the German [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development]], the [[European Commission]], and the permanent Secretariat to the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|(UNCCD)]]. Additionally, the [[Korea Forest Service]] supports the ELD Initiative as a political partner.

The ELD Initiative established a broad scientific network including the [http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/ CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems], [http://inweh.unu.edu/ United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH)], the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]], [[UNDP]], [[UNEP]], the [[Australian National University]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Wyoming]], the [http://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html University of Bern,] [http://www.ifpri.org/ IFPRI],  [http://www.global-mechanism.org/ Global Mechanism] and [http://www.iucn.org/ IUCN]. 
The ELD Initiative further focuses on collaborating with the [[Private sector]] as one of the main drivers for land degradation processes&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental_assessment_report_2003_10 &lt;nowiki&gt;[9]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;, to help businesses identify investment opportunities and incentives linked to the preservation and sustainable management of soils.

==  Vision ==
The partners’ vision of Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative is to transform global understanding of the value of land and create awareness of the economic case for sustainable land management that prevents loss of [[natural capital]], secures livelihoods, preserves ecosystem services, combats climate change, and addresses food, energy, and water security, and to create capacity for the utilisation of economic information for sustainable land management.

== Structure ==
Guided by Steering Group members and coordinated by the ELD Secretariat, the ELD Initiative produces reports, case studies, and other outputs. These outputs are compiled by its policy, private sector, and scientific partners. The ELD Secretariat is responsible for the coordination of processes within the Initiative and its communication, and also serves as first contact point for all existing and potential Partners.

Besides the Steering Group members, the ELD network includes senior experts from [[Crawford School of Public Policy]] - [[Australian National University]], [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] Africa Center, [[University of Leeds]], [[CGIAR]] ([[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas|ICARDA]]), Korea Forest Service and international organizations such as UNEP, UNDP and IUCN, amongst others.

==Outputs==
As of mid-2014, the ELD Initiative has published a “Scientific Interim Report’’ which details the general approach and methods considered by the Initiative and a “Business Brief’’ which outlines a methodology for risk assessment. In 2015, the ELD Initiative published three additional reports; one main report titled ‘The Value of Land, as well as reports tailored for policy-/decision makers and the private sector. The ELD Initiative further offers [[Capacity building]] activities for decision-makers. In 2014 for example a first [[Massive Open Online Course|Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)]] on the Economics of Land Degradation was offered in cooperation with UNU-INWEH. A second Massive Open Online Course titled 'Options and Pathways for Action: Stakeholder Engagement' took place on May 5 - June 27, 2015.

In September 2015, ELD produced a comprehensive synthesis or ‘main’ document, [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-main-report_08_web-72dpi_01.pdf The Value of Land]. This reference report details the monetary worth of land, the steps and methods that can be used to effectively conduct economic assessments of land values, and actions for the successful management and use thereof. Additionally, it provides global scenarios with information on important ecosystems and the potential future impacts based on the various possible economic conditions governing its management. The significance of stakeholder engagement is outlined with country-level examples.  The report was launched at the 70th United Nations General Assembly in Brussels. For video, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PM9rwkQUKE here].

An ancillary [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-pm-report_08_web_72dpi.pdf Report for Policy and Decision Makers] was released in parallel in September 2015, consisting of practical guidance and recommendations for policy-making in the use of economic instruments for sustainable management of land in the context of the SDG implementation process.

== Services and Products ==
The services offered by the ELD Initiative can be categorised into three key themes:  stakeholder dialogues, capacity-building as well as technical expertise and development of solutions. Such services and products can be outlined as follows:

* Total economic valuation methods which aid decision-making in land-use investments and planning.
* Building capacity amongst African, Asian and Central and Latin American countries to assess their land’s value.
* Providing practitioners and decision-makers with skills and tools to make an economic case for sustainable land management.
* Informing private sector of the opportunities available for investment in sustainable land management.
* Case studies on local regions with all the necessary information on the value of the land, relevant stakeholders, and methods of effectively managing land so as to be used more sustainably.

== Going Forward ==
After the presentation of the core reports the ELD Initiative in its coming Implementation Phase will be working on three key themes identified as targets are capacity development, awareness raising and communication, and knowledge management. ELD network partners have developed and discussed on strengths, weaknesses, and actions for the ELD going forward in this context.

Following various high-level presentations of the Initiative’s reports in the course of 2015, ELD has received a number of requests from national representatives for support through national studies and awareness raising activities. ELD Initiative will bring to bear the results of its scientific work and implement the ELD methodology in a number of additional national case studies closely linked with dialogues between decision makers and land managers, but also with capacity building activities in cooperation with local partners.

In this next phase, ELD aims to make economics of land degradation an integral part of policy strategies and decision making by increasing the political and public awareness of the costs and benefits of sustainable management of  land-based ecosystems and to increase the capacity to utilize economic data and [][http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/content/success-and-strategy-eld-takes-bangkok methodology].

The '''Energy efficiency in Europe''' study is part of the [[Odyssee project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/ Odyssee International Project].&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to monitor [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] progress and [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]]-reduction for the EU-28 countries and [[Norway]], understand the [[energy demand]] trends for European countries, compare the countries in their relative [energy efficiency performance, as well as to benchmark values, measuring the contribution of innovative energy efficiency and renewables technologies to the Lisbon targets to make Europe more competitive and analyse and evaluate the performance of energy efficiency policies in the different EU Member States and at EU level.

The [[ODYSSEE MURE]] is a program coordinated by [http://www2.ademe.fr/servlet/getDoc?id=11433&amp;m=3&amp;cid=96 ADEME] and supported under the [[Intelligent Energy Europe Programme]] of the [[European Commission]].

Energy efficiency is at the heart of the EU’s Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and of the transition to a [[Resource efficiency|resource efficient]] economy. According to EU Commission the EU needs to act now (2011) to get on track to achieve its target while the EU is on course to achieve only half of the 20% objective. The combined effects of full implementation of the measures will generate financial savings of up to €1000 per household annually; improve Europe’s industrial competitiveness; create up to 2 million jobs; and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 740 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52011DC0109:EN:HTML:NOT Energy Efficiency Plan 2011] European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Energy Efficiency Action Plans ==
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan plans offer an opportunity to compare the national energy efficiency measures in the European countries and review the actual national achievements compared to the targets. The first Energy Efficiency Action Plans NEEAP 2008–2010 were delivered in 2007. The second plans should cover the plans from 2011 forward.

=== NEEAP 2008–2010 ===
The action plan reports state the status in 2000–2005 and give the national policies and measures to energy savings by the national governments by sectors by 2016 and 2020.

The British plan sets a target that all new buildings will be zero-carbon from 2011 in Wales and make all homes in England zero carbon by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/uk_en.pdf UK Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2007] Defra Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (www.defra.gov.uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|According to the German plan energy efficiency constitutes a key competitive factor, greater security of supply of the exhaustible energy sources and the most effective means, from the point of view of costs, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The German target by 2020 is energy productivity double compared with 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/germany_en.pdf National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP) of the Federal Republic of Germany] Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Technology 27 September 2007 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
The "Energy efficiency in Europe" study gathers representatives, such as energy agencies, from the 28 EU Member States plus Norway and it aims at monitoring energy efficiency trends and policy measures in Europe. The [[Energy Technology Data Exchange#Energy Database|energy databases]] are managed by [[Enerdata]], which updates the Odyssee database twice by year.
Odysse measures the energy efficiency progress by main sector (industry, transport, households) and for the whole economy (all final consumers). MURE is a database on policy measures. This project is part of the activity of the [[EnR Club]].

==Energy efficiency in Europe : highlights and figures by sector==
Energy efficiency in the EU-27 improved by about 13% between 1996 and 2007, corresponding to 160 Mtoe energy savings in 2007.

===Industry===
Energy efficiency improved by about 2.1%/year since 1990. Each branches, except textile contributed to decrease the overall industrial efficiency index. Since 1998, structural changes towards less energy-intensive branches now strengthen the influence of efficiency improvements on actual energy intensity in industry. However the impact of these structural changes is limited : they explain about 13% of the reduction in the industrial intensity since 1998. The situation is meanwhile different in countries: structural changes explain a high share of the reduction in 5 countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Sweden, Ireland)

===Households===
In [[households]], energy efficiency improved by 1.1%/year since 1990. Space heating and large appliances experienced the greatest energy efficiency improvement: since 1990, close to 1.5%/year each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Energy Label|url=https://www.ovenu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pb13466-eu-energy-label.pdf|website=Ovenu UK|publisher=Europa.EU|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
Energy efficiency improved by 0,8% /year since 1990 .
The specific consumption of cars in liters/100&amp;nbsp;km is regularly decreasing (-0.9%/year since 1990), with a more rapidly improvements for new cars since 1995 (-1.6%/year). However, part of this gain is offset by a shift to larger cars.
For road goods transport, the energy consumption per ton-km has decreased regularly since 1993 because of a better management (increase in ton-km/veh except from 1998 to 2002)

==Energy efficiency indicators: objectives and methodology==
According to [http://www.enerdata.net Enerdata],  energy efficiency indicators can be used to make several types of analysis :

* Monitor the targets set at the national and international levels in energy efficiency and CO2 abatement programmes.
* Evaluate of the energy efficiency policy and programmes. Ministries, energy agencies or organisations in charge of the implementation of energy efficiency programmes need to provide regular evaluations to justify their action and the large amounts of public money that have been spent to support these programmes or to operate the energy efficiency agencies. In January 2013, the [[European Court of Auditors]] declare that reducing the primary energy consumption by 20% will be possible only by strengthening these evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/20590745.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plan future actions, including R&amp;D programmes,
* Feed the energy demand forecasting models and improving the quality of forecasts, technico-economic models, that are characterised by a high level of desegregation (end-uses) make use of energy efficiency indicators to account for future changes in energy efficiency.
* And finally, make cross-country comparisons in a harmonized way.

The energy intensity indicator is the most often used indicator to measure the energy efficiency. It is calculated per unit of [[Gdp|GDP]] for the overall indicator and transports or value added for services and agriculture or private consumption  for households. However, the ODEX index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/registred/definition_odex.pdf Definition of ODEX indicators in ODYSSEE data base]&lt;/ref&gt; represents a better proxy for assessing energy efficiency trends at an  aggregate level (e.g. overall economy, industry, households, transport, services) than the traditional energy intensities, as they are cleaned from structural changes and from other factors not related to energy efficiency (more appliances, more cars...).&lt;ref&gt;World Energy Council :[http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/energy_efficiency_policies_around_the_world_review_and_evaluation/2_energy_efficiency_trends/1181.asp Energy Efficiency Policies around the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ODEX index is used in the ODYSSEE-MURE project to measure the progress of energy efficiency by main sector (industry, transport, households) and for the whole economy (all final consumers).
For each sector, the index is calculated as a weighted average of sub-sectoral indices of energy efficiency progress; sub-sectors being industrial or service sector branches or end-uses for households or transport modes.

The sub-sectoral indices are calculated from variations of unit [[energy consumption]] indicators, measured in physical units and selected so as to provide the best “proxy” of energy efficiency progress, from a policy evaluation viewpoint. The fact that indices are used enables to combine different units for a given sector, for instance for households kWh/appliance, koe/m2, tep/dwelling…

The weight used to get the weighted aggregate is the share of each sub- sector in the total energy consumption of the sub–sectors considered in the calculation.

A value of ODEX equal to 90 means a 10% energy efficiency gain.

'''Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff''' (born 24 November 1949) is a Danish author and philosopher who has published within the genres of science fiction, science, [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[prose]] and non-fiction.

== Life ==
Neutzsky-Wulff is the son of [[Aage Neutzsky-Wulff]] (1891–1967). His half-sister [[Vita Andersen]] is known for her poetry and fiction.

Neutzsky-Wulff attended courses in philosophy at the [[University of Copenhagen]], but broke off his studies after his first year. Having lived in [[Copenhagen]] all of his life, he moved into an abandoned school in [[Vinstrup]] north of [[Randers]] with his wife, where he presently spends his time expanding his authorship. He occasionally holds courses on themes drawn from extensive interests.

== Competencies and influence ==
Neutzsky-Wulff has written in both fiction and non-fiction, on subjects as diverse as history, philosophy, [[cognition]], religion, the [[occult]], [[psychology]] and [[horror fiction]]. He also authored a number of books on [[computer programming]] during the 1980s. He is mainly self-taught and has mastered several languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latin]], German, French, English and the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]].

== Activities and interests ==
Neutzsky-Wulff keeps in touch with his readers through his fan magazine ''Bathos''{{Ref label|Bathos|2}} and his official home page. ''[[Bathos]]'', in addition to offering reviews of mainly old [[horror film]]s, also contains in-depth articles on philosophy, religion, culture and various [[esoteric]] subjects. In addition, the magazine expounds on the author's philosophy and on various themes in his literature.

== Works ==
In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The ''[[Dialog om det 21. århundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer]]{{Ref label|Dialogue|3}}'', (1971), is a philosophical [[dialogue]] modelled on the classical style of [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new [[humanistic]] view on mankind and its new ideology (or anti-ideology), called ''[[Wulffianism]]''. ''Wulffianism'' is [[anarchism|anarchic]] in the word's real sense, entailing an accept of violence as a mean and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy.{{Ref label|Controversy|4}} Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned [[dialogue]]s. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in [[rhymed|rhyme]], [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] with a touch of subtle [[pastiche]].

With the [[episodic novel]] ''[[Adam Harts Opdagelser]]'' &lt;'''5'''&gt; (1972), Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as "[[occult detective]]s". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' &lt;'''6'''&gt; (1977) ''[[Victor Janis og søn]]'' &lt;'''7'''&gt; (1977), both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, ''[[Oiufael]]'' (1977), mainly written on verse. An episode from ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' was adapted as the short film ''[[Adam Hart i Sahara]]'' (1990), based on his own screenplay.

Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the [[genre]], Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. ''[[Anno Domini]]'' (1975) tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a [[macrohistorical]] version of the evolution of humankind. In ''[[Gud (novel)|Gud]]'' &lt;'''8'''&gt; (1976), the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With ''[[Den 33. marts]]'' &lt;'''9'''&gt; (1977), the plot is altered from ''outer'' to "''inner space''", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, [[Philip K. Dick]]. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]], this person "[[hallucinates]]" about another world where he features as an awaited [[Messiah]]. ''[[Havet]]'' &lt;'''10'''&gt; (1978) is, like ''Anno Domini'' and ''Gud'', a novel about [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. The supernatural setting pivots around the [[Tarot cards|cards of Tarok]]. In ''[[Menneske]]'' &lt;'''11'''&gt; (1982), a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a [[human being]] is like. Consequently, it embarks on a [[stone age]] [[odyssey]], following the history of man, ending in a [[parody]] of the 1970s of Denmark.

=== Demons and computers ===
Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff describes by novel form esoteric initiation and demonic possession in ''[[Indsigtens sted]]'' &lt;'''12'''&gt; (1980). The narration is set through a schoolteacher's diary as he is experiencing increasingly interest in the occult. This is an effective horror story which distinguishes itself from his other books. For Neutzsky-Wulff, the eighties were to stand under the parole of prose. Neutzsky-Wulff had taught himself computer programming and when the first [[home computer]]s entered the market, he published an introductory manual, ''[[Mikrodatamaten]] – Programmering og anvendelse'' (1982), followed by several similar guides the following years. At the time, computer programming was still seen as an intellectual pursuit in a rather anti-intellectual climate.

His prosaic studies of the supernatural followed with ''[[Okkultisme]]'' &lt;'''13'''&gt; (1985) and ''[[Magi]]'' &lt;'''14'''&gt; (1986). ''Okkultisme'' raises its groundwork from epistemology, modern physics and neurology, as well as interpretations of visionary [[lyrics]], for instance [[William Blake]]'s. The book's second part gives an historical briefing on the [[history of religion]]s, from [[tribe|tribal]] religion through [[Judaism]] and Christianity, to [[Satanism]]. "Satanism" is in Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship used partly as a common denominator of a quite specific group, and partly as a philosophical term for the ideology of modern society. This ideology is, as explained, essentially [[anti-Christian]].

''Magi'' treats themes such as the supernatural, its practice, supernatural experiences and the citizens of the world beyond ours. Our present day civilization is depicted evil to an extent that hatred is given as the primary human condition (p.&amp;nbsp;222). ''Magi'' was followed by ''[[Oprindelse]]'' &lt;'''15'''&gt; (1988), the first and only volume of an abortive world history, covering a time line from the [[Big Bang]] until app. 2700 BC.

''[[Faust]]'', (1989) resembles, by structure and form, to a certain point the earlier "Den 33. marts". Neutzsky-Wulff's modern [[Faust]] is not a theologian, but rather a [[psychoanalyst]] who defies his discipline. On 20 August 1989, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff preached at [[:da:Hellig Kors Kirke|Hellig Kors Kirke]], a church in central Copenhagen, declaring that Christianity had come to an end.

=== Brick novels ===
In Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship the traditional novel form now appears to be cracking, as his novels grow in size and are thoroughly embedded with several subplots parallel to the main story. Furthermore, they attain a more objective form and prosaic essence, which provides his [[ontological platform]] with deeper insights. Also the author himself becomes [[omnipresent]], frequently either commenting on fictional actions or directly addressing the reader. [[2000 (novel)|2000]] (1991) is a science fictional [[Decameron]], where a handful of persons are isolated and share information between themselves. Around them, civilization deteriorates and a brand new kind of [[humankind|human]] is born. In the epic ''Verden'' &lt;'''16'''&gt; (1994), Neutzsky-Wulff includes time travels and similar phenomena, as he tries to delete Christ from history. Døden &lt;'''17'''&gt; (1996), distinguishes itself from other novels by its political main theme, especially the 1990s' emerging [[chauvinist]] and [[neofascist]] tendencies. This novel attracted public spotlights, as the dissolution of the journal [[Faklen]] caused a public dispute between its editors. Neutzsky-Wulff himself added yet another creation to his authorship with ''[[UFO]]'' (1999). ''UFO'' enhances his science fiction-novels of the 70s by reviewing the occult and mythological foundations of the UFO-phenomenon. In between his novel writing, Neutzsky-Wulff translated [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], which was published as ''[[For længe siden]]'' &lt;'''19'''&gt; (2000). In his ''[[Abattoir]]'' &lt;'''20'''&gt; (2003), he returns to his lighter style, reminiscent of the Adam Hart series.

=== A modern grimoire ===
[[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcend]]ent ambitions forges the massive arguments appearing in Rum &lt;'''21'''&gt; (2001), his greatest fictional work to date, and the prose work ''[[Det overnaturlige]]'' &lt;'''22'''&gt; (2004) expounding on the essence and forms of religious experience and reality itself, treating much the same topics as the earlier ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', only now in much more depth. These parallel works fulfil these ambitions fully from two different holds.

The heavy ''Rum'' is illustrated with a deliberate "bad taste" by [[Jørgen Bitsch]]. The plot is set in separated rooms: A girl selling herself as a [[sex slave]], a man in a bunker after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], an expedition to an [[alien planet]], a [[haunted house]] investigator and finally, a poet not knowing he is an inspirational source for a [[mass murderer]]. These rooms can be thought of as [[:wikt:interlink|interlinked]]: They are books read by the man in the bunker or visions seen by the slave girl etc. Neutzsky-Wulff and his wife also appear. Later, the characters exchange locations. Reality constrains itself to self-created rooms and the apparently incoherent action is deliberately supposed to influence the reader to assume a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] way of thinking. It is an abyssal book, hardly fully comprehensible by any but a few.

The prose ''Det overnaturlige'', more or less exact than ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', is at the same time meant to displace them by writing a modern [[grimoire]]. It is information-dense, cut to the bone and indirectly demands that the reader study a number of texts only referred to in the book to properly understand it. The book describes the [[mysticism|mystic]] initiation, a radical practice requiring women to be sexually [[Slavery|enslaved]] (as in ''Rum''), whereas men have to undergo a kind of virtual [[castration]]. Themes as diverse as [[kabbalah]], the mystic traditions of the [[Holy Grail]], [[Gnosticism]], [[fairy tales]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[The Magic Flute]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] are treated in depth.

=== Critique ===
Neutzsky-Wulff's books are quite unlike most contemporary Danish literature and can read like the texts of a strange, foreign religion at times. Time has shown that critics have a tendency to either praise them wholeheartedly or else distance themselves from them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-15-683800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the [[Kykeon]], the [[sacrament]] used during the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[ancient Greece]] between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an ethnomycologist as such, [[philologist]] [[John Allegro]] has made an important contribution suggesting, in a book controversial enough to have his academic career destroyed, that ''Amanita muscaria'' was not only consumed as a sacrament but was the main focus of worship in the more [[esoteric]] sects of [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian religion]], [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-340-12875-5
  | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Heinrich]] claims that ''Amanita muscaria'' use in Europe was not completely wiped out by [[Orthodox Christianity]] but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as [[medieval]] [[Holy Grail]] [[myth]] makers, [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[Renaissance]] artists.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

The '''European Biophysical Societies' Association''' is an association existing to promote [[Biophysics]] in Europe and to disseminate "knowledge of the principles, recent developments and applications of biophysics, and to foster the exchange of scientific information among European biophysicists and biophysicists in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.M.|title=European Biophysical Societies' Association|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=1984|volume=11|issue=2|pages=77|doi=10.1007/BF00276620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
At the end of the 1970s, there appeared to be an interest in creating a formal association of various existing European Biophysical Societies. In November 1981, a meeting organized by the German Biophysical Society set the stage for developing concrete “aims of the Association…namely to promote scientific contacts and cooperation with the organization of joint meetings.”&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

EBSA was established in 1984, at the 8th IUPAB Congress of Biophysics, held in Bristol, after representatives from 8 European Biophysical Societies (Belgian, British, Danish, German, Italian, Netherlands, Swedish and Swiss) met to develop and sign a founding constitution and rules of association.&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was also in 1984 that the journal Biophysics of Structure and Mechanism became the [[European Biophysics Journal]], published by Springer-Verlag. Since 2000, EBJ has been owned entirely by EBSA and it is currently available free of charge to its members. Ownership of the journal has provided a financial base from which EBSA undertakes many of its activities.&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Because biophysics is a unique combination of diverse scientific subjects, particularly fertile with the advancement of biotechnology and quantitative and analytical methods in biology, EBSA’s has a prolific range of activities geared towards bringing innovative people and ideas together. Every two years EBSA organizes the European Biophysics Congress. The last Congress was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal|title=9th European Biophysics Congress|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2013|volume=42|doi=10.1007/s00249-013-0917-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2015 Congress will be held in Dresden, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th European Biophysics Congress|url=http://www.ebsa2015.org|work=EBSA 2015|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, EBSA offers a variety of sponsorship to institutions and individuals working towards promoting biophysics in Europe, such as organisers of European biophysics meetings and schools with biophysics courses.&lt;ref name="ebsaoffical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsorship|url=http://www.ebsa.org|work=EBSA Official Website|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

EBSA also offers bursaries to young scientists to attend scientific meetings and to participate in the Biophysics Congress, as well as the Young Investigators’ Medal and Prize, which is awarded every Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bursaries|url=http://www.ebsa.org|work=EBSA Official Website|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the recipient of the medal was Justin Molley, from York, UK; in 2003, it was Martin Weik, from Grenoble, France; in 2005, it was Gyorgy Panyi, from Debrecen, Hungary; in 2007, it was [[Marc Baldus]], from Göttingen, Germany; in 2009, it was Michel Valle, from Derio-Bizkaia, Spain; and in 2011, it was Kinneret Keren.

==Organisation==

EBSA membership includes a total of 25 societies throughout Europe. The Executive Committee is composed of ten members drawn from different member societies, and includes a President, Vice-President, Past-President, Secretary, Treasurer and Managing Editor of EBJ. During a General Assembly, the voting representative of each Member Society and a non-voting representative are invited to attend and consider a number of issues and “discuss the direction of EBSA”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of the Association|url=http://www.ebsa.org|work=EBSA Official Webpage|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of [[automotive design]] and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan]], devoted to matters pertaining to the [[Ophthalmology|eye and vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |title=The History of the EyesOn Design Car Show in June at the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe |first=Philip C. |last=Hessburg |publisher=Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132027/http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |archivedate=28 January 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.3ds.com/company/news-media/press-releases-detail/release/dassault-systemes-continues-tradition-of-sponsoring-eyeson/single/2492/?cHash=52d09b3ccc0fc59eaa396693b0dd4e7b |title=Dassault Systèmes Continues Tradition of Sponsoring EyesOn Design Competition |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Dassault Systèmes |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the [[Grosse Pointe Academy]] parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler LLC|Chrysler]]), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]].

To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year.&lt;ref name="beauregard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/features/2002/020715eyesondesign/index.html |title=Eyes on Design 2002 - A weekend of classic design |first=Marc |last=Beauregard |date=15 July 2002| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was held at the [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center]] in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to [[General Motors]], the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |title=Design Automotive Exhibit at the GM Technical Center |publisher=General Motors |date=6 March 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212908/http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt; Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM [[concept car]]s.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/rss_display/item214620/|title=2011 EyesOn Design Awards |first=Eric |last=Gallina |date=21 January 2011| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.candgnews.com/news/eyeson-design-celebrates-25-years-visionary-vehicles |title=EyesOn Design celebrates 25 years of visionary vehicles |first=K.

== Design focus ==
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |last=Wright |first=Richard A. |title=From modest beginnings, Eyes on Design is now a major show| newspaper=The Detroit News |date=7 July 2003 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120318005148/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |archivedate=18 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |title= Honorary Chairman Announced for 2001 Eyes On Design |date=20 April 2001 |publisher= Ford Motor |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092232/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

== Lifetime Design Achievement ==
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/January-February-2010/EyesOn-Design-Celebrates-23-Years-with-the-Launch-of-its-2010-Season/ |title=EyesOn Design Celebrates 23 Years with the Launch of its 2010 Season |date=23 December 2009 |journal=dbusiness |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', a famous [[illuminated manuscript]], is on view to both the public and to scholars only in the form of a high-quality facsimile]]
A '''facsimile''' (from [[Latin]] ''fac simile'' (to 'make alike')) is a copy or reproduction of an old [[book]], [[manuscript]], [[map]], [[Old master print|art print]], or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a "partial facsimile". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for [[media preservation]] and [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]]. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in [[limited edition]]s, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand [[United States dollars]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The term "[[fax]]" is a shortened form of "facsimile" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.

==Facsimiles in the age of mechanical reproduction==
Advances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in [[printmaking]]. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected.&lt;ref name="koeman"&gt;C. Koeman, "An Increase in Facsimile Reprints," ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 18 (1964), pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is the [[Abraham Ortelius]] [[map]] (1598).&lt;ref name="koeman"/&gt; Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of  [[lithography]] and [[aquatint]], facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of [[old master]] drawings that could be studied from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hartley, "Aquatint," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RueMorgueManuscript.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Facsimile of Edgar Allan Poe's original manuscript for ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'']] In the past, a technique such as the [[photostat]], [[hectograph]], or [[lithograph]] was usually used to create facsimiles. More recently, facsimiles have been made by the use of some form of [[photographic]] technique. For documents, a facsimile most often refers to document reproduction by a [[photocopy]] machine. In the digital age, an [[image scanner]], a [[personal computer]], and a [[desktop printer]] can be used to make a facsimile.

==Facsimiles and conservation==
Important [[illuminated manuscript]]s like [[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/about/institutions.aspx Public institutions with facsimile collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDD1E3FF936A15752C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Paul Lewis, "Preservation takes rare manuscripts from the public," ''New York Times''] - 25 January 1987 [accessed 19 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/culturalcollections/exhibitions/facsimile/essay.html Bronwyn Stocks, "The Facsimile and the Manuscript,"] - an exhibition in the Leigh Scott Gallery, [[University of Melbourne]] (on-line catalogue with additional images).&lt;/ref&gt;

Facsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Godfrey, "Reproduction reproductive prints," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as [[replica]]s.

The [[human body]] and even its individual [[body fluid]]s may be [[concept]]ually divided into various '''fluid compartments''', which, although not literally [[fascial compartment|anatomic compartments]], do represent a real division in terms of how portions of the body's [[water]], [[solution|solutes]], and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]]  elements are segregated. The two main fluid compartments are the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular compartment is the space within the organism's [[cell (biology)|cells]]; it is separated from the extracellular compartment by [[cell membrane]]s.&lt;ref name="RhoadesBell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodney A. Rhoades|author2=David R. Bell|title=Medical Phisiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kGcFOKCUzkC&amp;pg=PA5|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-427-3|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two thirds of the [[body water|total body water]] of humans is held in the cells, mostly in the [[cytosol]], and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment. The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types: [[interstitial fluid]] in the "interstitial compartment" (surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals), [[blood plasma]] and [[lymph]] in the "intravascular compartment" (inside the [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymphatic vessel]]s), and small amounts of [[transcellular fluid]] such as [[Aqueous humour|ocular]] and  [[Cerebrospinal fluid|cerebrospinal]] fluids in the "transcellular compartment". The interstitial and intravascular compartments readily exchange water and solutes but the third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, is thought of as separate from the other two and not in dynamic equilibrium with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacob M, Chappell D, Rehm M |title=The 'third space'--fact or fiction? |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=145–57 |year=2009 |pmid=19653435 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intracellular compartment ==

The intracellular fluid, also known as [[cytosol]], is all fluid contained inside the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Thomas A.|title=Rapid Review Physiology|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323072607|page=2|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=mr1KI4lFYekC&amp;pg=PA2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the matrix in which cellular [[organelle]]s are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the [[cytoplasm]]. The [[cell membrane]]s are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 8 litres of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in [[osmosis|osmotic]] equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulphate ions.

== Extracellular compartment ==
The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) contains about one-third of [[total body water]].

=== Interstitial compartment ===
The interstitial compartment (also called "tissue space") surrounds tissue cells.  It is filled with [[interstitial fluid]]. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]] that allows for movement of [[ions]], [[proteins]] and [[nutrients]] across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the [[capillary|blood capillaries]] and recollected by [[lymph capillary|lymphatic capillaries]]. In the average male (70&amp;nbsp;kg) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 litres of fluid.

===Intravascular compartment===
The main intravascular fluid in mammals is [[blood]], a complex [[mixture]] with elements of a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] ([[blood cell]]s), [[colloid]] ([[globulin]]s), and [[solutes]] ([[glucose]] and [[ion]]s). The blood represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside the blood cells) and the extracellular compartment (the [[blood plasma]]). The other intravascular fluid is [[lymph]]. It too represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside its [[lymphocyte]]s) and the extracellular compartment (the noncellular matrix of the lymph, which is roughly equivalent to [[serum (blood)|serum]]). The average volume of plasma in the average (70&amp;nbsp;kg) male is approximately 3.5 liters.  The volume of the intravascular compartment is regulated in part by [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic]] pressure gradients, and by reabsorption by the kidneys.

===Transcellular compartment===
The third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, consists of those spaces in the body where fluid does not normally collect in larger amounts,&lt;ref name="Timby2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Kuhn Timby|title=Fundamental Nursing Skills and Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4HwH5IxfToC&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=9 June 2010|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7909-8|pages=319–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12219956"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redden M, Wotton K |title=Third-space fluid shift in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery: Part 1: Pathophysiological mechanisms |journal=Contemp Nurse |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=275–83 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12219956 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where any significant fluid collection is physiologically nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Drain, Cecil B. |title=Perianesthesia nursing: a critical care approach |publisher=W.B. Saunders Co |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-9257-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vy9K9cWnsV0C]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of transcellular spaces include the eye, the central nervous system, the [[peritoneal cavity|peritoneal]] and [[pleural cavity|pleural]] cavities, and the [[joint capsule]]s. A small amount of fluid, called [[transcellular fluid]], does exist normally in such spaces. For example, the [[aqueous humor]], the [[vitreous humor]], the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the [[serous fluid]] produced by the [[serous membrane]]s, and the [[synovial fluid]] produced by the [[synovial membrane]]s are all transcellular fluids. They are all very important, yet there is not much of each. For example, there is only about 150&amp;nbsp;mL of cerebrospinal fluid in the entire central nervous system at any moment. All of the aforementioned fluids are produced by active cellular processes working with blood plasma as the raw material, and they are all more or less similar to blood plasma except for certain modifications tailored to their function. For example, the cerebrospinal fluid is made by various cells of the CNS, mostly the [[ependyma]]l cells, from blood plasma.

==Fluid shift==
''Fluid shifts'' occur when the body's fluids move between the fluid compartments. Physiologically, this occurs by a combination of [[hydrostatic pressure]] gradients and [[osmotic pressure]] gradients. Water will move from one space into the next passively across a semi permeable membrane until the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients balance each other. Many medical conditions can cause fluid shifts. When fluid moves out of the intravascular compartment (the blood vessels), blood pressure can drop to dangerously low levels, endangering critical organs such as the [[brain]], [[heart]] and [[kidney]]s; when it shifts out of the cells (the intracellular compartment), cellular processes slow down or cease from intracellular dehydration; when excessive fluid accumulates in the interstitial space, [[oedema]] develops; and fluid shifts into the brain cells can cause increased cranial pressure. Fluid shifts may be compensated by [[fluid replacement]] or [[diuretic]]s.

===Third spacing===
"Third spacing" is the abnormal accumulation of fluid into an extracellular and extravascular space. In medicine, the term is often used with regard to loss of fluid into interstitial spaces, such as with [[burn (injury)|burns]] or [[edema]], but it can also refer to fluid shifts into a body cavity (transcellular space), such as [[ascites]] and [[pleural effusion]]s. With regard to severe burns, fluids may pool on the burn site (i.e. fluid lying outside of the interstitial tissue, exposed to evaporation) and cause depletion of the fluids. With [[pancreatitis]] or [[ileus]], fluids may "leak out" into the [[peritoneal cavity]], also causing depletion of the intracellular, interstitial or vascular compartments.

Patients who undergo long, difficult operations in large surgical fields can collect third-space fluids and become intravascularly depleted despite large volumes of intravenous fluid and blood replacement.

The precise volume of fluid in a patient's third spaces changes over time and is difficult to accurately quantify.

Third spacing conditions may include [[peritonitis]], [[pyometritis]], and [[pleural effusion]]s.&lt;ref name="urlFLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/clinsci/wing/fluids/fluids.htm |title=FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY |work= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrocephalus]] and [[glaucoma]] are theoretically forms of third spacing, but the volumes are too small to induce significant shifts in blood volumes, or overall body volumes, and thus are generally not referred to as third spacing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20983">[[Fluorescence]] is used in the life sciences generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysing biological molecules by means of fluorescence.
Some [[protein]]s or [[small molecule]]s in cells are naturally fluorescent, which is called intrinsic fluorescence or [[autofluorescence]] (such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], [[tryptophan]] or endogenous [[chlorophyll]], [[phycoerythrin]] or [[green fluorescent protein]]). Alternatively, specific or general proteins, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[lipids]] or small molecules can be "labelled" with an extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] which can be a small molecule, protein or [[quantum dot]]. Several techniques exist to exploit additional properties of [[fluorophore]]s, such as [[Förster resonance energy transfer|fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], where the energy is passed non-radiatively to a particular neighbouring dye, allowing proximity or protein activation to be detected; another is the change in properties, such as intensity, of certain dyes depending on their environment allowing their use in structural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R.

{{Main|fluorescence}}
The principle behind fluorescence is that the [[fluorophore|fluorescent moiety]] contains [[electrons]] which can absorb a [[photon]] and briefly enter an [[excited state]] before either dispersing the energy non-radiatively or [[Spontaneous emission|emitting it as a photon]], but with a lower energy, i.e., at a longer wavelength (wavelength and energy are inversely proportional).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ Animation for the principle of fluorescence and UV-visible absorbance]&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference in the excitation and emission wavelengths is called the [[Stokes shift]], and the time that an excited electron takes to emit the photon is called a [[Exponential decay|lifetime]]. The [[quantum yield]] is an indicator of the efficiency of the dye (it is the ratio of emitted photons per absorbed photon), and the extinction coefficient is the amount of light that can be absorbed by a fluorophore. Both the quantum yield and extinction coefficient are specific for each fluorophore and multiplied together calculates the brightness of the fluorescent molecule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=4DD9D52E-5056-8A76-4E6E-E217FAD0D86B#brightness Fluorescent Probes].

==Labelling==

===Reactive dyes===
{{Main|fluorophore}}

Fluorophores can be attached to proteins via specific functional groups, such as
* [[amino]] groups (''e.g.'' via [[succinimide]], [[Isothiocyanate]] or [[hydrazine]])
* [[carboxyl]] groups (''e.g.'' via [[carbodiimide]])
* [[thiol]] (''e.g.'' via [[maleimide]] or [[acetyl bromide]])
* [[azide]] (''e.g.'' via [[click chemistry]])
or non-specificately ([[glutaraldehyde]]) or non-covalently (''e.g.'' via [[hydrophobicity]], etc.).

These fluorophores are either small molecules, protein or quantum dots.

Organic fluorophores fluoresce thanks to delocalized electrons which can jump a band and stabilize the energy absorbed, hence most fluorophores are [[conjugated system]]s. Several families exits and their excitations range from the [[infrared]] to the [[ultraviolet]]. &lt;br&gt;Lanthanides (chelated) are uniquely fluorescent metals, which emit thanks to transitions involving 4''f'' orbits, which are forbidden, hence they have very low [[absorption coefficient]]s and slow emissions, requiring exitation through fluorescent organic [[chelation|chelators]] (''e.g.'' [[Dipicolinic acid|dipicolinate]]-based [[Terbium|Terbium (III)]] chelators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7711110|year=1995|last1=Lamture|first1=JB|last2=Wensel|first2=TG|title=Intensely luminescent immunoreactive conjugates of proteins and dipicolinate-based polymeric Tb (III) chelates|volume=6|issue=1|pages=88–92|journal=Bioconjugate Chemistry|doi=10.1021/bc00031a010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). &lt;br&gt;A third class of small molecule fluorophore is that of the [[transition metal]]-ligand [[Coordination complex|complexes]], which display molecular fluorescence from a [[MLCT|metal-to-ligand charge transfer state]] which is partially forbidden, these are generally complexes of [[Ruthenium]], [[Rhenium]] or [[Osmium]].

===Quantum dots===
[[Quantum dots]] are fluorescent semiconductor [[nanoparticles]].

===Fluorescent proteins===
Several fluorescent protein exist in nature{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, but the most important one as a research tool is [[Green Fluorescent Protein]] (GFP) from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8303295|year=1994|last1=Chalfie|first1=M|last2=Tu|first2=Y|last3=Euskirchen|first3=G|last4=Ward|first4=WW|last5=Prasher|first5=DC|title=Green fluorescent protein as a marker for gene expression|volume=263|issue=5148|pages=802–5|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.8303295}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spontaneously fluoresces upon folding via specific serine-tyrosine-glycine residues. The benefit that GFP and other fluorescent proteins have over [[organic dye]]s or quantum dots is that they can be expressed exogenously in cells alone or as a [[fusion protein]], a protein that is created by ligating the fluorescent gene (e.g., GFP) to another gene and whose expression is driven by a housekeeping gene [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] or another specific promoter. This approach allows fluorescent proteins to be used as reporters for any number of biological events, such as [[sub-cellular localization]] and [[Spatiotemporal gene expression|expression patterns]].
A variant of GFP is naturally found in [[coral]]s, specifically the [[Anthozoa]], and several mutants have been created to span the visible spectra and fluoresce longer and more stably.
Other proteins are fluorescent but require a fluorophore cofactor, and hence can only be used ''in vitro''; these are often found in plants and algae (phytofluors, [[phycobiliprotein]] such as [[allophycocyanin]]).

==Bioluminescence and fluorescence==

[[Fluorescence]], [[chemiluminescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] are 3 different types of [[luminescence]] properties, i.e. emission of light from a substance.
Fluorescence is a property where light is absorbed and remitted within a few nanoseconds (approx. 10ns&lt;!-- Lakowicz' book on page 1, not really an average but a guestimate--&gt;) at a lower energy (=higher wavelength), while [[bioluminescence]] is biological [[chemiluminescence]], a property where light is generated by a chemical reaction of an enzyme on a substrate.
[[Phosphorescence]] is a property of materials to absorb light and emit the energy several milliseconds or more later (due to forbidden transitions to the [[ground state]] of a [[triplet state]], while fluorescence occurs in exited [[singlet state]]s). Until recently was not applicable to life science research due to the size of the inorganic particles. However the boundary between the fluorescence and phosphorescence is not clean cut as [[transition metal]]-ligand complexes, which combine a metal and several organic moieties, have long lifetimes, up to several microseconds (as they display mixed singlet-triplet states).

==Comparison with radioactivity==
{{See also|Radioactivity in biological research}}
Prior to its widespread use in the past three decades [[radioactivity]] was the most common label.

The advantages of fluorescence over radioactive labels are as follows:
* Fluorescence is safer to use and does not require radiological controls
* Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET, whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope such as [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special machinery (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen or a specific dual channel detector)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html |title=The Micro Imager by Biospace Lab |website=Biospacelab.com |accessdate=2011-06-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html |archivedate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Note: a [[Channel (digital image)|channel]] is similar to "colour" but distinct, it is the pair of excitation and emission filters specific for a dye, e.g. agilent microarrays are dual channel, working on cy3 and cy5, these are colloquially referred to as green and red.

Fluorescence is not necessarily more convenient to use because it requires specialized detection equipment of its own.  For non-quantitative or relative quantification applications it can be useful but it is poorly suited for making absolute measurement because of fluorescence [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]], whereas measuring radioactively labeled molecules is always direct and highly sensitive.

Disadvantages of fluorophores include:
* Significantly changes the properties of a fluorescently-labeled molecule
* Interference with normal biological processes
* Toxicity

==Additional useful properties==

The basic property of fluorescence are extensively used, such as a marker of labelled components in cells ([[fluorescence microscopy]]) or as an indicator in solution ([[Fluorescence spectroscopy]]), but other additional properties, not found with radioactivity, make it even more extensively used.

===FRET===

{{Main|Förster resonance energy transfer}}
[[File:Squid's fret.svg|thumb|380px|right|Cartoon of FRET between two protein interacting protein, labelled with [[fluorescein]] and tetramethyl[[rhodamine]]]]
FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) is a property in which the energy of the excited electron of one fluorphore, called the donor, is passed on to a nearby acceptor dye, either a [[dark quencher]] or another fluorophore, which has an excitation spectrum which overlaps with the emission spectrum of the donor dye resulting in a reduced fluorescence.
This can be used to
* detect if two labelled protein or nucleic acids come into contact or a doubly labelled single molecules is hydrolysed
* detect changed in conformation
* measure concentration by a competitive binding assay

===Sensitivity to environment===

{{See also|Solvatochromism}}
[[File:Badan.svg|thumb|380px|Example of an environmentally sensitive dye,  Badan, which having a tertiary amine and a ketone at opposite ends displays a large change in dipole momentum when exited (including an internal charge transfer), which results in turn in a significant lowering of the energy when solvent relaxation occurs]]
Environment-sensitive dyes change their properties (intensity, half-life, and excitation and emission spectra) depending on the polarity (hydrophobicity and charge) of their environments. examples include: [[Indole]], Cascade Yellow, prodan, Dansyl, Dapoxyl, NBD, PyMPO, Pyrene and diethylaminocumarin.&lt;br /&gt;
This change is most pronounced when electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are placed at opposite ends of an aromatic ring system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmeth0305-160b|title=A 'flaky' but useful fluorophore|year=2005|last1=Evanko|first1=Daniel|journal=Nature Methods|volume=2|issue=3|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this results in a large change in [[Electron electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] when excited.

When a fluorophore is excited, it generally has a larger dipole moment (μ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) than in the ground state (μ&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). Absorption of a photon by a fluorophore takes a few picoseconds. Before this energy is released (emission: 1–10 ns), the solvent molecules surrounding the fluorophore reorient (10–100 ps) due to the change in polarity in the excited singlet state; this process is called solvent relaxation. As a result of this relaxation, the energy of the excited state of the fluorophore is lowered (longer wavelength), hence fluorophores that have a large change in dipole moment have larger stokes shift changes in different solvents. The difference between the energy levels can be roughly determined with the Lipper-Mataga equation.

It should be noted that a [[hydrophobic]] dye is a dye which is insoluble in water, a property independent of solvatochromism. &lt;br&gt;Additionally, The term [[chromism|environment-sensitive]] in chemistry actually describes changes due to one of a variety of different environmental factors, such as pH or temperature, not just polarity; however, in biochemistry environment-sensitive fluorphore and solvatochromic fluorophore are used interchangeably: this convention is so widespread that suppliers describe them as environment-sensitive over solvatochromic.

===Fluorescence lifetime===
{{Main|Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy|l1=Fluorescent lifetime}}
Fluorescent moieties emit photons several nanoseconds after absorption following an exponential decay curve, which differs between dyes and depends on the surrounding solvent. When the dye is attached to a macromolecules the decay curve becomes multiexponential. Conjugated dyes generally have a lifetime between 1–10 ns, a small amount of longer lived exceptions exist, notably pyrene with a lifetime of 400ns in degassed solvents or 100ns in lipids and [[coronene]] with 200ns. On a different category of fluorphores are the fluorescent organometals (lanthanides and transition metal-ligand complexes) which have been [[Fluorescence in the life sciences#Reactive dyes|previously described]], which have much longer lifetimes due to the restricted states: lanthanides have lifetimes of 0.5 to 3 ms, while transition metal-ligand complexes have lifetimes of 10 ns to 10 µs. Note that fluorescent lifetime should not be confused with the photodestruction lifetime or the "shelf-life" of a dye.

===Multiphoton excitation===
{{Main|Two-photon excitation microscopy}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Multiphoton excitation is a way of focusing the viewing plane of the microscope by taking advantage of the phenomenon where two simultaneous low energy photons are absorbed by a fluorescent moiety which normally absorbs one photon with double their individual energy: say two NIR photons (800&amp;nbsp;nm) to excite a UV dye (400&amp;nbsp;nm).

===Fluorescence anisotropy===
{{Main|Fluorescence anisotropy}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
A perfectly immobile fluorescent moiety when exited with [[polarized light]] will emit light which is also polarized. However, if a molecule is moving, it will tend to "scramble" the polarization of the light by radiating at a different direction from the incident light.

==Methods==

{{Further|Nucleic acid methods}}
{{Further|Protein methods}}

* [[fluorescence microscope|Fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells or subcellular structures is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labeling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image.
* Automated sequencing of [[DNA]] by the [[chain termination method]]; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labeled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.
[[File:AgarosegelUV.jpg|thumb|right|Ethidium bromide stained [[agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose gel]]. Ethidium bromide fluoresces orange when [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] [[DNA]] and when exposed to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light.]]
* DNA detection: the compound [[ethidium bromide]], when free to change its conformation in solution, has very little fluorescence. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced when it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]]. Ethidium bromide can be toxic – a purportedly safer alternative is the dye [[SYBR Green]].
* The [[DNA microarray]]
* Immunology: An antibody has a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.
* FACS ([[fluorescent-activated cell sorting]])
* [[Microscale Thermophoresis]] (MST) uses fluorescence as readout to quantify the directed movement of biomolecules in microscopic temperature gradients.
* Fluorescence has been used to study the structure and conformations of DNA and proteins with techniques such as [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], which measures distance at the angstrom level. This is especially important in complexes of multiple biomolecules.
* Fluorescence can be applied to study colocalization of various proteins of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.proghi.2009.03.001|title=Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience|year=2009|last1=Zinchuk|first1=Grossenbacher-Zinchuk|journal=Prog Histochem Cytochem|volume=44|issue=3|pages=125–172|pmid=19822255}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then can be analyzed using a specialized software, like [[CoLocalizer Pro]].

Also, many biological molecules have an intrinsic fluorescence that can sometimes be used without the need to attach a chemical tag. Sometimes this intrinsic fluorescence changes when the molecule is in a specific environment, so the distribution or binding of the molecule can be measured. [[Bilirubin]], for instance, is highly fluorescent when bound to a specific site on serum albumin. [[Zinc protoporphyrin]], formed in developing red blood cells instead of hemoglobin when iron is unavailable or lead is present, has a bright fluorescence and can be used to detect these problems.

The number of fluorescence applications in the biomedical, biological and related sciences continuously expands. Methods of analysis in these fields are also growing, often with nomenclature in the form of acronyms such as: [[Fluorescence lifetime imaging|FLIM]], FLI, [[Fluorescence loss in photobleaching|FLIP]], CALI, FLIE, [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer|FRET]], [[Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching|FRAP]], [[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy|FCS]], PFRAP, smFRET, FIONA, FRIPS, SHREK, SHRIMP or [[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]]. Most of these techniques rely on fluorescence microscopes, which use high intensity light sources, usually mercury or xenon lamps, LEDs, or lasers, to excite fluorescence in the samples under observation. Optical filters then separate excitation light from emitted fluorescence to be detected by eye or with a (CCD) camera or other light detector (e.g., photomultiplier tubes, spectrographs). Considerable research is underway to improve the capabilities of such microscopes, the fluorescent probes used, and the applications they are applied to. Of particular note are confocal microscopes, which use a pinhole to achieve [[optical sectioning]], which affords a quantitative, 3D view of the sample.

'''Forest degradation''' is a process in which the biological wealth of a forest area is permanently diminished by some factor or by a combination of factors. "This does not involve a reduction of the forest area, but rather a quality decrease in its condition."The forest is still there, but with less number of trees, or less species of trees, plants or animals, or some of them affected by plagues. This degradation makes the forest less valuable and may lead to [[deforestation]]. Forest degradation is a type of the more general issue of [[land degradation]].

== Interpretations of the term ==

Deforestation is much worse than forest degradation, but it is clear and visible. On the contrary, forest degradation may start and go on without showing clear effects. It is difficult to measure and even the very term is controversial. In a paper&lt;ref name="Lanly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanly|first1=Jean-Paul|date=2003|title=DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION FACTORS|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/article/wfc/xii/ms12a-e.htm|journal=Proceedings of the XII World Forestry Congress|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the XII World Forestry Congress, 2003, Jean-Paul Lanly states:  "The situation is even less satisfactory regarding forest degradation due in particular to the imprecision and multiple, and often subjective, interpretations of the term". In 2009 Lund&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Robert|last2=Pacheco|first2=Pablo|last3=Montero|first3=Juan Carlos|title=El contexto de la deforestación y degradación de los bosques en Bolivia|date=2014|publisher=CIFOR|location=Bolivia|isbn=978-602-1504-29-1|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-100.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  identified more than 50 definitions of forest degradation.

Previously to this August 2017 editing, the Wikipedia page Forest degradation was redirected to [[Secondary forest]], a forest which has re-grown after a timber harvest. This is a confusion: a secondary forest may be perfectly healthy, and a [[primary forest]] may be suffering degradation.

The term "permanently" also poses some difficulties: a forest affected by a mild seasonal [[drought]] may experience a loss of its biological wealth, but if it is seasonally reversed, then it is not considered degradation. On the contrary, a severe prolonged drought may seriously degrade a forest and make human intervention advisable to limit damages.

== Difficulties which hamper the assessment of degradation ==

According to Lanly,&lt;ref name = "Lanly" /&gt; there are 3 difficulties:

* the different choices of the initial state of reference or baseline;
* the chosen criteria: health, biodiversity, production capacity; and
* the opinion on the evolution prospects: will the final result of the process be desirable or undesirable?

For mapping forest degradation in Bolivia, Müller et al.&lt;ref name="Müller" /&gt; consider areas where only between 30% and 70% of the original forest cover remains. If less than 30% remains, the area is considered as deforested, and if more than 70% remains, the forest is considered intact.

Davidar et al.&lt;ref name="Davidar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidar|first1=Priya|last2=Sashoo|first2=Sasmita|last3=Mammen|first3=Pratheesh C.|last4=Acharya|first4=Prashanth|last5=Puyravaud|first5=Jean-Philippe|last6=Arjunan|first6=M.|last7=Garrigues|first7=Jean Pierre|last8=Roessingh|first8=Krista|title=Assessing the extent and causes of forest degradation in India: Where do we stand?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=15 May 2010|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Priya_Davidar/publication/238364841_Assesing_the_extent_and_causes_of_forest_degradation_in_India_Where_do_we_stand/links/55d3116f08ae0a3417225b41/Assesing-the-extent-and-causes-of-forest-degradation-in-India-Where-do-we-stand.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2017|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.04.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; also think that "Loss of dense and moderately dense forest cover is suggestive of forest degradation." but for the moment no parameter exists "that indicates at what speed forests become degraded and how long it will take for the ecosystem to degrade beyond the point of recovery."
 
== Causes ==

The Dominican Center for Agricultural and Forest Development&lt;ref name="Ovalles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ovalles|first1=P.|title=Causas de la deforestación y degradación de bosques en la República Dominicana|url=http://www.cedaf.org.do/REDD/causas.pdf|website=CEDAF|publisher=CEDAF|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following causes of forest degradation:
* Excessive extraction of forest products like timber, charcoal or resin.
* Road building: after it has been built, the road favours soil erosion.
* Open mining: the area where extraction takes place is, of course, completely deforested, but also the surrounding zone suffers a degradation of its fauna and flora. 
* Expansion of urban areas.

Davidar et al.&lt;ref name="Davidar"/&gt; add another:

*  Livestock grazing: goats or sheep eat tree seedlings, thus slowing natural forest regeneration.

Earth Eclipse,&lt;ref name="Eclipse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eclipse|first1=Earth|title=What is Forest Degradation?|url=http://www.eartheclipse.com/environment/causes-of-forest-degradation.html|website=Earth Eclipse|publisher=Earth Eclipse|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a platform of environment research articles, adds the following causes:
* [[Acid rain]]
* Pests and diseases
* Air pollution. Degradation for this cause is specifically called&lt;ref name="InTech"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakravarty|first1=Sumit|last2=Ghosh|first2=S. K.|last3=Suresh|first3=C. P.|last4=Dey|first4=A. N.|last5=Shukla|first5=Gopal|title=Causes, Effects and Control Strategies, Global Perspectives on Sustainable Forest Management|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/36125/InTechDeforestation_causes_effects_and_control_strategies.pdf|website=InTech|publisher=InTech|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Waldsterben'' (German word) or forest death.
* Forest fragmentation: a large forest is broken up in smaller woods, which destroys the habitat of large animals.
* Land pollution
* Soil erosion (''see image above'') and sedimentation

Finally Chakravarty et al.,&lt;ref name="InTech"/&gt; as another cause, point at:
* Excessive or unrespectful tourism

== Remedies to forest degradation ==

Generally, any [[Deforestation#Control|measure to prevent deforestation]] will also reduce forest degradation. Specifically for degradation, Greenpeace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenpeace|first1=-|title=Solutions to Deforestation|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/forests/solutions-to-deforestation|website=Greenpeace|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes:

* Attaining a responsible forest products industry
* [[Sustainable forest management]]

Curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide (to combat acid rain) would also reduce forest degradation for this cause. If a coal-fired power plant uses low-quality coal (with a high sulfur contents), this may be alleviated by [[flue-gas desulfurization]].

== Initiatives against forest degradation ==

* [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+) is an international voluntary climate change mitigation approach to curb deforestation and forest degradation. This mechanism makes part of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) since 2005.
* The [[United Nations REDD Programme|United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (or UN-REDD Programme) is a collaborative programme created in 2008 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). It should not be confused with "REDD+. The UN-REDD Programme supports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PROGRAMME|first1=UN-REDD|title=About the UN-REDD Programme|url=http://www.un-redd.org/|website=UN-REDD|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; its partner countries (more than 60) through direct funding and technical support to national REDD+ programmes and technical capacity enhancing.

'''fraLine''' is a non-profit (research) project of [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-university.de/de/fachbereiche/fb2/forschung_institute_projekte/fraline.html Project on the Website of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; Project and research activities focus on IT services management for schools and the use of digital media in educational settings. fraLine is also a joint project between the University of Applied Sciences and the city of [[Frankfurt]] am Main (represented by the "Stadtschulamt" = municipal school-maintaining body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=4096&amp;_ffmpar_id_inhalt=20557 City of Frankfurt website]&lt;/ref&gt; fraLine and the city of Frankfurt cooperate in the fields of IT support and IT service management in educational contexts as well as technical implementation of digital media in class. fraLine also cooperates with the Hessian state education authority ("[[:de:Staatliches Schulamt|Staatliches Schulamt]]") in the field of media education and digital media training for teachers. 
fraLine was launched in 2001 and employs mainly technical students of the University of Applied Sciences and [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], but also IT professionals, engineers and media educators.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.thomas-knaus.de Dr. Thomas Knaus] and [http://fraline.de/personen/team fraLine team page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development projects==

===Projects===
fraLine conducts research in the fields of [[IT service management]] according to [[ITIL]] recommendations&lt;ref&gt;cf. e.g. [http://fraline.de/images/Downloads/Qualifikationsarbeiten/diplomarbeit_itil_schmelz_09Aug.pdf "Analysis of ITSM elements in the technical support for schools of a major school-maintaining body as to their consistency with ITIL recommendations" by Anthony Schmelz]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the field of IT support and digital media use in educational contexts including [[educational software]], [[media literacy]] etc. 
Research results and concepts are provided to the city of Frankfurt ("Stadtschulamt") for the improvement of information technology in schools and the establishment of a centrally managed school IT infrastructure in the municipal area. Therefore, fraLine also offers advisory services to the city of Frankfurt, to all municipal schools as well as other educational institutions on topics such as acquisition of computers or computer parts, hardware, IT security, remote service etc.

Research in technical areas is complemented by studies in media education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas-knaus.de/index.php/en/research Research projects by Dr. Thomas Knaus]&lt;/ref&gt; Results in the field of media education and current media projects are presented on the annual expert conference "fraMediale"&lt;ref&gt;The list of speakers in 2009 included the mayor of Frankfurt Mrs. [[Jutta Ebeling]] and the President of the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt Dr.-Ing. [[Detlev Buchholz]] as well as several representatives of "Project Lehr@mt" at Frankfurt Goethe University [http://www.zlf.uni-frankfurt.de/wir-ueber-uns/neue-medien/index.html "Project Lehr@mt"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framediale.de Conference webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; which is hosted and organized by fraLine.&lt;ref&gt;A conference volume is published by "kopaed" (German publishing house) under the title [http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=697 "fraMediale - digitale Medien in Bildungseinrichtungen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

fraLine developed the "fraDesk", a multi-user capable [[trouble ticket system]] for coordinating and documenting customer requests, incident reports or general processes based on division of labor. fraLine uses this software in its own everyday routine. The "fraDesk" is free software and was presented at the [[CeBIT]] 2008 in [[Hanover]], Germany.

Other research projects conducted by fraLine employees&lt;ref&gt;cp. [http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications/academic-papers-and-reports List of publications on the project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; include the development of standard resource administration and user management for schools, improvement of school support via remote maintenance and support, but also media educational topics such as content filtering, evaluation of [[educational software]] and media communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=637 "Kommunigrafie - eine empirische Studie zur Bedeutung von Text und Bild in der digitalen Kommunikation" ("An empirical study concerning the meaning of text and image in digital communication") by Dr. Thomas Knaus ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge base for teachers===
fraLine publishes relevant information for schools as well as research results in the form of test reports and academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications Test reports and academic papers]&lt;/ref&gt; a glossary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/de/glossar Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; and a large set of FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fraline.de/faq/ fraLine "FAQ" knowledge database"]&lt;/ref&gt; The FAQ database is a practical [[knowledge base]] [[Knowledge base]] and used as a point of reference for local teachers and others. It includes technical tutorials and information on the Frankfurt local school network, operating systems, software, hardware, peripheral equipment, the Internet, licenses and rights of utilization. 
Additionally, fraLine offers tutorials and introductory courses imparting theoretical and practical knowledge to school teachers and school IT representatives in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support services for schools==
The fraLine student team offers practical IT support to all 152 schools in Frankfurt by operating a telephone hotline, the Internet-based helpdesk "fraDesk" and through on-site service. Financed by public funds through the city of Frankfurt the service is free of charge for schools. It covers everyday troubleshooting relating to [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], as well as software installation, actualisation and handling. In order to coordinate its support services, fraLine cooperates with so-called "IT representatives" in every school. They are appointed by their school principals and responsible for collecting IT-incidents and requests in their schools and communicating them to fraLine. Here, fraLine functions as first point of contact ("single-point-of-contact"). If problems cannot be solved by telephone, fraLine employees visit schools on-site or help them to refer their request to the competent authorities (e.g. school maintaining body ("Stadtschulamt"), or the Department of Information and Communicational Technology).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Deutschherrenschule (secondary school in Frankfurt) includes fraLine in its [http://www.schuleundzukunft.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Medienschulen/Medienkonzept_Deutschherrenschule.pdf  "media concept" (page 3f.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes criticized that IT-support carried out by students does not match the schools´ need for a "professional" support. On the other hand, only senior students who are identified as possessing the necessary qualifications are accepted at the project. 
In addition to the technical support, fraLine also offers training courses for teachers and school administration staff in the fields of IT-infrastructure and media use in educational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As another way to support schools, fraLine launched the project "educational-technical assistance". As part of this project, fraLine employees accompany teachers during class offering them technical assistance with the digital media devices they plan to use in their lesson. The project aims at reducing technical insecurities of teachers and wants to promote a broader use of digital media in education.

==Partnerships, cooperations and awards==
fraLine contributes to various multi-organisational and interdisciplinary initiatives in Frankfurt am Main, in the federal state of Hesse and in Germany responding to the growing demand for a sensible use of media in education. Thus, fraLine maintains close partnerships with its sister projects in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schul-support-service.de/ School support service in the city of Bremen "S3"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3s.hh.schule.de/ School support service in the city of Hamburg "3S"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2007, fraLine was awarded with the "Germany – Land of Ideas" award. "Land of Ideas" is an initiative under the patronage of former German Federal President [[Horst Köhler]]. Public or private institutions that have developed innovations and ideas are nominated as so-called "landmarks in the land of ideas" for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-of-ideas.org/CDA/landmark_of_the_day,6482,1,,en.html?action=detail&amp;id=3303 ''Land of Ideas'' (June 10, 2008), "A Win-Win Situation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John-Garton-reduced 2.jpg|thumb|right|John Garton]]

'''Dr John Garton''', of the firm of Garton Brothers of [[Newton-le-Willows]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was the  Originator of Scientific Farm Plant Breeding. He is credited as the first scientist to show that the common grain crops and many other plants are self-fertilizing. He also invented the process of multiple cross-fertilization of crop plants.

In 1898 the business became known as '''Gartons Limited''' and, under the inspired commercial leadership of '''George Peddie Miln''', was to become the British Empire's largest [[plant breeding]] and [[seed company]]. 

A public company from the start, its shares were traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1947.

==History of the business==

John Garton and his two brothers, Robert and Thomas, were in business with their father, Peter, in Golborne and Newton-le-Willows in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], as corn and agricultural merchants.

As a young man, John Garton (1863–1922),&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 27 May 1922&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to understand that whilst some agricultural plants were self-pollinating, others were cross-pollinating. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops. 

He attracted the friendship and encouragement of a young Scottish seedsman, George Peddie Miln (1861–1928)&lt;ref&gt;The Nurseryman and Seedsman, 4 January 1919&lt;/ref&gt; who had trained in [[Dundee]] and was seed manager of Dicksons Limited of [[Chester]].

Knowing he had developed a far reaching new technique in plant breeding John Garton began to carry out many thousands of controlled crosses on fields at the family farm in Newton-le-Willows. He and his colleagues tried in 1889 to interest the UK Government’s new Board of Agriculture in the invention they called '''Scientific Farm Plant Breeding'''.  But this was to no avail.

===Commercial start===

Robert&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and John Garton made a commercial start as R. &amp; J. Garton.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; They launched their first variety, 'Abundance' oat, in 1892.

Generous publicity followed in the press, together with the publication of articles by botanists in the Journal of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]], and in the Transactions of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]] in 1894 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhass.org.uk Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829144444/http://www.rhass.org.uk/ |date=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Wallace (1853–1939) of the [[University of Edinburgh]] said 'Under the system originated by Mr John Garton an infinite number of new and distinct breeds of oats, barleys, wheats, clovers and grasses have been produced'.&lt;ref&gt;Page 22, 1900 Seed Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 a public company was launched, Gartons Limited. It was based in [[Warrington]]. Many of the 600 or so subscribers for £50,000 cumulative preference shares of 6% rising to 10% were farmers. 

George Peddie Miln joined the company as Managing Director, together with Robert Garton, Thomas R. Garton, Thomas Baxter and Arthur Smith as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian front page, 6 August 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and John Garton agreed to continue to work for the Company for five years for £500 and to receive the entire ordinary share capital of the new company of £50,000.{{clarification needed|perhaps this makes sense to business people, but it sounds as if they absconded with the capital|date=October 2013}}

It rapidly became the United Kingdom's best known plant breeding and seed company, and also exported seeds widely.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 26 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garton Lectureship at Edinburgh University===

In 1900 an endowment was made to found the Garton Lectureship in Indian and Colonial Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19390118&amp;id=uTU1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L6YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3643,2419176|journal=The Glasgow Herald|title=Obituary: Emeritus Professor Robert Wallace, An authority on agricultural matters — 37 years in Edinburgh chair|date=18 January 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garton Lectureship still exists as a biennial award to promising young lecturers in the School of Agriculture but is without [[emolument]]s and is no longer tied to colonial agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Britain's First Chair of Agriculture, Fleming &amp; Robertson, {{ISBN|0-902164-33-3}} pages 47 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity in USA===

Noel Kingsbury writes:&lt;ref&gt;page 140 Kingsbury, Noel. Hybrid : the history and science of plant breeding. University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0-226-43704-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From the late nineteenth century on, seed companies began to play an increasingly important, if not dominant, role in breeding non-cereal crops and a major role in producing varieties for market gardening and for private growers. The production of new cereals was a somewhat different matter - the fact that they were so vitally important for national food supplies and involved large-scale and long-term work made it more likely that they would be the concern of government. 

There were exceptions though, one being the family firm of Gartons of Warrington, Lancashire, in the north of England. Their production of cereals - oats in particular - was appreciated as internationally important during the latter quarter of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth; (The American wheat breeder) [[Mark A. Carleton|Mark Carleton]] visited them in 1898 and was reportedly astonished at their work, Garton varieties were widely exported throughout the British Empire (then by far and away the world's largest political unit) and the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"That private companies could be so effective in breeding cereal grains indicated that there was no link of necessity between their improvement and the publicly funded research that was to so dominate this sector over so much of the next century." 

In 1903 Professor [[Willet M. Hays]] (1859–1927) of the Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Minnesota]], USA said 'No one has done more brilliant work in Agricultural Plant Breeding than Messrs. Garton, and this is from now on to be recognised.'&lt;ref&gt;Page 5, 1902 Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted intellectual property donation===

The introduction to their 1899 Spring Catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Gartons Limited's Spring 1899 Seed Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our original idea for the dissemination of the seed of these new breeds as the stocks became sufficiently large for the purpose, was through some public body as in the form of an annual free seed distribution upon similar lines to the free seed distributions carried out by the Governments of the United States, Canada, and several of the British Colonies. 

''On three successive occasions we approached Her Majesty's Government with this object in view, the first occasion being on the formation of the Board of Agriculture, in 1889, when we offered to hand over the whole of the valuable results, providing that body would undertake their dissemination and the continuance of the work, either in the form of an annual free seed distribution or at current market price.''

''Upon the last occasion our offer was accompanied by letters and reports from all the leading Agricultural Professors, Botanists, and Scientists in the Kingdom, setting forth the national benefit which would accrue from the dissemination of the results in the form we had suggested. The final reply of Her Majesty's Government, however, was that whilst fully recognising the value of the work, owing to there being no precedent upon which to act in such a matter, they were unable to avail themselves of the offer. This was much to be regretted for had our ideas been carried into effect the British farmer would have been placed in immediate possession of important results, which in the hands of a Public Company would not reach him for many years.''

''Our efforts in this direction not having been successful, and as we were not in a position to undertake the work of distribution ourselves, we have placed it in the lands{{verify source|reason=should that be "hands"?|date=October 2013}} of a Public Company, and we trust that the continued efforts made by us on behalf of the British farmer will be fully appreciated by him, through his support of the Company responsible for the distribution of the seed of our new breeds of agricultural plants''

''R. &amp; J. Garton''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crop innovations===

The firm's first historic introduction was 'Abundance' [[oat]], the world's first agricultural plant variety bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other 170 crop varieties&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/barnabymiln/Site/Gartons.html Gartons]&lt;/ref&gt; that Gartons bred and introduced to commerce were:

* 'Standwell' [[barley]], introduced in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Seed  Catalogue 1898, Gartons&lt;/ref&gt; the first barley bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'White Monarch' [[wheat]], introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first wheat bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'Invincible' barley, introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first crop plant control crossed for disease resistance.

===John Garton's honorary doctorate===

On 23 March 1922 the Senatus Academicus of the [[University of Edinburgh]] offered to confer the honorary doctorate of LL.D on John Garton shortly before his death, which he duly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian 26 August 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal 29 July 1922 page 191&lt;/ref&gt; At its meeting on 6 July 1922 the Senatus Academicus learned that John Garton had died.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme and report of the Graduation Ceremony held on 21 July 1922 reads &lt;blockquote&gt; The Senatus Academicus recently conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws upon the late John Garton, who duly accepted it. The Degree would have been formally conferred on the present occasion but for his lamented death. Mr Garton invented the process of multiple cross fertilisation of crop plants and has been the means in a great measure of revolutionising field culture by producing hundreds of new and improved varieties which have greatly increased the yields of all the common crops of the farm. The achievement proved to be of immense national importance during the War.

Mr Garton first showed that the common grain crops and many other crop plants are self-fertilising. Up till that time they were generally believed to be fertilised by wind or insects.
Mr Garton’s results got in crossing different species of grasses helped to develop the modern conception of species.

Twenty-two tears ago Mr Garton provided the means to establish the Garton Lectures on Colonial and Indian Agriculture, and subsequently he permanently endowed them as an integral part of the work of the Chair of Agriculture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Plant breeding grounds===

The plant breeding grounds were initially at Newton-le-Willows but moved to Acton Grange, two and a half miles south west of Warrington before settling in about 1930 at Little Leigh near [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]]. A seed development farm was located in [[Essex]], and root crop trials were located on farms in the north of England and in [[Scotland]]. Traditionally groups of farmers were invited in mid-summer to inspect the plant breeding grounds and be entertained by the Company.

[[File:LittleLeighTrials.jpg|thumb|right]]

Initially the Seed Warehouse for cleaning and distributing seed was in [[Newton-le-Willows]] but moved to Friars Green in Warrington in 1899 by which time the offices were at Thynne Street, Warrington.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1901&lt;/ref&gt; A purpose built seven story Seed Warehouse and separate Head Office were built at Arpley, Warrington in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1910&lt;/ref&gt; There was an L. M. S.  railway siding into the Seed Warehouse. On 25 April 1912 the Seed Warehouse burned down&lt;ref&gt;Photograph in T.E.Miln's Newspaper Cutting Book, Miln Family Cartulary&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly rebuilt largely by the same builders. Seed cleaning machinery, some unique to the Company, ensured the purity of the product. As time went by fewer seeds were ‘picked’ or cleaned by hand by upwards of one hundred staff as machinery became more sophisticated. Across the top of roof of the warehouse was the company’s name which had to be disguised during wartime.

[[File:Gartons-Warehouse.tiff|thumb|right]]

From the beginning Gartons Limited tested its seeds for purity and germination at its own seed testing laboratories in Warrington. The [[1920 Seeds Act]], for the first time, made testing and declaring for purity and germination a legal requirement for all seed companies. The [[Official Seed Testing Station]] was created in 1917, firstly in Victoria Street in [[Westminster]], [[London]] and then in 1921 within the newly formed [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] in [[Cambridge]]. Larger seed companies including Gartons Limited were licensed to carry out their own purity and germination testing. 

[[File:Gartons World Records.jpg|thumb|right]]

===Commercial success and competition===

Gartons Limited was the United Kingdom’s only major agricultural plant breeding company.  But this caused them difficulties as early as in their Spring 1900 seed catalogue where a paragraph of the introduction reads: &lt;blockquote&gt; It has come to our knowledge that nearly all the New Breeds introduced by us up to the present time have been renamed by various dealers and are being offered by them under different names. Although the honesty of this conduct is more than questionable, we are resigned for the present to regard it as a novel form of flattery, but we strongly recommend all those who wish to secure our Seeds to order them direct from us, as they cannot be procured from any other genuine source. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Great War (1914–1918) the United Kingdom government funded cereal breeding at the Plant Breeding Institute at Cambridge which had been founded in 1912,  and funded the setting up of plant breeding stations in Edinburgh (1921), Aberystwyth (1919) and in Glasnevin, Northern Ireland in competition with Gartons Limited.

The 1960 Report of the Committee on Transactions in Seeds set up by Parliament entitled Plant Breeders' Rights &lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960&lt;/ref&gt; stated that whilst two thirds of breeding work was by then carried out by government organisations, one third was in the hands of private breeders. And yet the only non-government funded agricultural crop plant breeding, research and testing establishment visited by the Committee was to Gartons Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 allowed plant breeders  to fully protect and be rewarded for their introductions. The last variety bred by Gartons, 'Apex' wheat, was the first British bred wheat to be awarded plant breeders rights in 1967 under this legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Photographs of the Gartons Warrington Warehouse and Office built in 1910, The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Headquarters Plant Breeding Grounds in Cheshire, from The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairmen and directors===

The eldest of the three Garton brothers, Robert Garton, was the first chairman of Gartons Limited. He died in February 1950, aged 91,&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; a widower with no children. He was succeeded by the youngest brother, Thomas R. Garton, who died in May 1956. His son, John, was chairman from August 1963 until September 1965. Dr John Garton, the middle of the three brothers, was never, a director.

Nine members of the Miln family were involved with the business over a period of seventy five years.

[[File:Three-Miln-Generations.jpg|thumb|left]]

:[[File:George-Peddie-Miln.jpg|thumb|right|George Peddie Miln]]

Born at Linlathen, [[Broughty Ferry]] in 1861,  George Peddie Miln trained in a Dundee seed warehouse, the traditional Scottish training for a young man with ambition in the seed trade. He moved to [[Chester]] and ran one of its old established seed merchants before joining Gartons Limited as its first Managing Director in 1898. He was a member of Her Majesty's Board of Agriculture Seeds Advisory Council during the first World War. Both the Seeds Act 1920 and the formation of the [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] came about with his considerable encouragement during his three-year presidency of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom. Of his eleven children, five trained in the seed trade. He was a Justice of the Peace in the City of [[Chester]], a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He died aged 68 following an unsuccessful operation.

When George P. Miln died in 1928 he was succeeded as managing director by his eldest son, Thomas Edward Miln (1890–1963)&lt;ref&gt;The Field, 25 November 1922&lt;/ref&gt; who for over twenty five years was chairman of the Retail Committee of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom which proudly kept its independence from government control during World War II. A plant breeder as well as a businessman he is credited with the introduction of the sugar beet crop to UK agriculture. 

When Gartons Limited became a public quoted company on the London Stock Exchange in 1947 T. E. Miln entered into a further ten year employment contract as Managing Director, even though he was already 59, such was his reputation. Both his sons, Wallace and George, joined him in the business.

[[File:T E Miln.jpg|thumb|right|T.E. Miln]]

[[File:Wallace Miln.jpg|thumb|right|Wallace Miln]]
T. E. Miln was succeeded in 1961 by his elder son, Wallace Miln (1919–1994) also a skilled plant breeder and seed analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 5 January 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace Miln was one of the three founders of the British Association of Plant Breeders at the time of the introduction of the United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964. He was twice President of the Seed Trade Association of United Kingdom. He left Gartons Limited in 1973 to join his elder son, [[Barnaby Miln]], who had trained at Gartons and later with [[Northrup-King]]  in Minneapolis before setting up his own seed business at Bodenham in Herefordshire.

From 1947 Gartons Limited's shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange.  The Company's profits for the previous seven years had averaged £48,940.&lt;ref&gt;London Corn Circular, 1 August 1947&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the profit of £75,340  was the highest ever recorded &lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, 20 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt; by the Company.

===Decline and closure===

In 1965 Peter Darlington&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 16 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; became chairman of Gartons Limited. In a dramatic change of direction in 1967 Gartons Limited ceased retailing seeds directly to farmers. Instead  a new brand was created, Gartons GROplan, and marketing became wholesale through agricultural merchants throughout the United Kingdom. However Gartons GROplan was sold to Agricultural Holdings Company Limited in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;The Times newspaper, London, Friday 2 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; but Gartons Limited continued as a plant breeding company.

Gartons plc, as it became known, ceased trading in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 August 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The seed warehouse at Bridge Foot, Warrington, which had dominated the town centre skyline since 1910, was demolished in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 15 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A hotel was built on the site.

==The Garton System of Plant Breeding==

These Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1900:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To those who are not acquainted with the botanical construction of plants it may be well to explain that plants possess generative organs, which correspond to those of the male and female in the animal kingdom. In the animal kingdom, progeny is derived from the mating of different animals of the same breed; in the vegetable kingdom the rule is that the seed is produced through the agency of the generative organs growing together on the same plant. Prior to the commencement of the work initiated by us and carried on during the past 20 years, which has led to the production of our New and Improved Breeds of agricultural plants, it was a recognised belief that many farm plants in the production of their seed were more or less cross-fertilised. The results of our experiments however have proved that such was not the case but that constant in-and-in breeding was the rule. 

Where such in-and-in breeding takes place the results are governed by the same natural laws as the in-and-in breeding of animals. In the production of New Breeds of animals the rule followed is to mate two animals of distinct breeds. The progeny, when fixity of type has been secured, constitutes a New Breed. 

Under our system of plant breeding we carry the mating of varieties or breeds far beyond what is practised in the animal kingdom. In the first instance we mate varieties and also what were formerly regarded as distinct species of the same genera, and after fixation, the progeny by these combinations are further mated together. 

A further extension of our system which is in itself unique and instructive, is the mating of uncultivated indigenous plants of the same Natural Order as the cultivated varieties. From such combinations most valuable results have been obtained. 

For example In Southern Asia there exists a species of wheat botanically known as Triticum spelta. In some districts it is looked upon as an indigenous weed infesting the cultivated crops of wheat. 

Under no climatic conditions does the grain of this species shed its seed when ripe, and even in threshing it is not possible to separate the grains, as the spikelets break off at the bases of the glumes, the grains remaining firmly enclosed between the chaff scales. 

By mating the varieties of this species with cultivated varieties, new breeds have been produced which will under no conditions shed their seed when ripe, but which thresh out a perfectly clean sample with a much heavier yield per acre than common wheat. 

In China there is an indigenous species of oat botanically known as Avena nuda or naked oat. The peculiar feature of this species is that the grains (which are very small) grow without any husk, being protected only by the chaff. The habit of the plant is likewise quite unique, four or five grains being suspended upon a thread-like filament about half an inch long. The mating of this species with cultivated varieties has produced new breeds giving yields 50 to 100 per cent. heavier than the original cultivated parents, with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the skin. 

The wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain has likewise been used with marked success in the production of new breeds in conjunction with the cultivated varieties. In the wild oat there is hardiness of constitution, vigour, strength of straw, and remarkable fertility. All these qualities have been retained in the new breeds produced. 

Another part of our system is the improvement of existing varieties of agricultural plants. The method is similar to that adopted by the breeder of stock for the improvement of his animals, when fresh blood of the same breed is introduced from some other herd. 

By crossing two distinct plants of the same variety the resulting progeny is more vigorous and robust in constitution, whilst the habit and individual character of the variety is maintained.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''A year later, these Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1901:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;FOR over 20 years the work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of producing New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there for the first time been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self fertilising. In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers. This natural process results in a perfect system of in-breeding which has been going on for an indefinite period, making it possible to grow the different varieties of crops of the same kind in close proximity to each other, and even as mixed crops without any danger of crosses being produced. 

If crossing could have occurred in nature it would have been quite impossible to maintain the purity of any variety of crop plant for more than a year or two. As in the Animal Kingdom, the in-breeding of plants tends to the decrease of constitutional vigour, consequently when cross-fertilisation is practised the size and vigour of the selected progeny are increased in a remarkable degree.
 
Although the natural laws which govern the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdoms bear a very strong resemblance to each other, further points can be realised and greater progress can be made in a limited time with plants than with animals under a system of cross breeding. 

Not only have varieties of a given species, but what were formerly regarded as distinct species belonging to the same genus, been successfully mated. 
The tendency to sterility in their progeny is overcome by introducing pollen from one or other '01' the original plants, it being the male organs of reproduction that are liable to be absent or defective in the progeny of two extremely divergent parent plants. Many varieties as well as species can thus be blended in the formation of a new breed, but as it is necessary to secure fixity of type in every cross bred plant before it is again used for crossing, the labour and care involved are very considerable. 

Attempts at the production of first crosses are not new, as these have been practised for many years by experimenters in the same field, who however stopped short of the point at which the Garton System achieved its greatest results, viz.  by compound or multiple crossing. This further stage of the work of cross fertilisation leads to a thorough dislocation of the usual course of the law of inheritance by which "like produces like." In the wilderness of uncertainty and confusion which follows and in which the great majority of the progeny are found to be abortive or inferior, a few choice specimens appear which are grown for a number of years until fixity of type has been secured. These superior and selected specimens are adopted as suitable for cultivation, and a number of them are described in this Catalogue and offered to the public as much superior to the old varieties from which they were derived by the Garton System of Plant Breeding. In making the selections the large quantity and superior quality of the grain, together with great standing power in the straw have been the chief characteristics aimed at, and if these desiderata have been secured in a few of the new breeds to the detriment of the habit of "tillering," the difficulty is readily overcome by providing a liberal seeding.
 
Some of the most striking and valuable results have been achieved by introducing as progenitors, certain weeds belonging to the same natural order of plants as the cultivated parents. For example, an inferior variety of "spelt" wheat Triticum spelta from Southern Asia, has been employed with excellent results to introduce strength of gluten to the grain, and large yielding and standing power to the crop with immunity from shedding its seed during harvest.
 
A wild naked Oat, Avena nuda, indigenous to China has been used to produce new breeds which yield in some instances 100 per cent. more than their cultivated parents. Four or five grains are suspended in each spikelet by a thread like filament about half-an-inch long. This peculiar habit of the plant 'has been extended in the progeny and an' accompanying illustration shows a spikelet with no fewer than 14 grains in it.
 
The hardiness of constitution, standing power of straw, and remarkable fertility of the wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain have been successfully introduced, but not without many difficulties, into some of the new breeds.
 
Some progress has also been made with the improvement of existing varieties of Agricultural plants by introducing pollen from plants of the same variety to increase the vigour of the plant without materially altering its general characteristics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hormesis''' is any process in a cell or organism that exhibits a [[phase (pharmacology)|biphasic]] response to exposure to increasing amounts of a substance or condition.&lt;ref name="mattson"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2248601|year=2007|last1=Mattson|first1=M. P|title=Hormesis Defined|journal=Ageing Research Reviews|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.007|pmid=18162444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the '''hormetic zone''', there is generally a favorable biological response to low exposures to [[toxin]]s and other [[stressor]]s. Hormesis comes from Greek ''hórmēsis'' "rapid motion, eagerness", itself from ancient Greek ''hormáein'' "to set in motion, impel, urge on". Hormetics is the term proposed for the study and science of hormesis.

In [[toxicology]], hormesis is a [[dose response]] phenomenon characterized by a low dose stimulation, high dose inhibition, resulting in either a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose response.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt; Such environmental factors that would seem to produce positive responses have also been termed "[[eustress]]". The hormesis model of dose response is vigorously debated.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; The notion that hormesis is important for chemical risks regulations is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15473091 |year=2004 |last1=Axelrod |first1=Deborah |last2=Burns |first2=Kathy |last3=Davis |first3=Devra |last4=von Larebeke |first4=Nicolas |title='Hormesis'—An Inappropriate Extrapolation from the Specific to the Universal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1077-3525&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=335&amp;epage=339 |hdl=1854/LU-867581 |doi=10.1179/oeh.2004.10.3.335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biochemical mechanisms by which hormesis works remain under laboratory research and are not well understood.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt;

==History==
German [[pharmacologist]] [[Hugo Schulz]] first described such a phenomenon in 1888 following his own observations that the growth of yeast could be stimulated by small doses of poisons. This was coupled with the work of German physician [[Rudolph Arndt]], who studied animals given low doses of drugs, eventually giving rise to the [[Arndt-Schulz rule]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.302.5644.376 |title=Sipping from a Poisoned Chalice |year=2003 |last1=Kaiser |first1=Jocelyn |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5644 |pages=376–9 |pmid=14563981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt's advocacy of [[homeopathy]] contributed to the rule's diminished credibility in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"/&gt; The term "hormesis" was coined and used for the first time in a scientific paper by [[Chester M. Southam]] and J. Ehrlich in 1943 in the journal: Phytopathology, volume 33, pp.&amp;nbsp;517–541.
Recently, [[Edward Calabrese]] has revived the concept of hormesis.&lt;ref name="Calabrese"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400222 |title=Hormesis: A revolution in toxicology, risk assessment and medicine |year=2004 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |pages=S37–40 |pmid=15459733 |pmc=1299203 |issue=Suppl 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calabrese 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bethell | first = Tom | title = The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science | publisher = Regnery Publishing | location = USA | pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xX4m7s7_4L0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA58,M1 | isbn = 978-0-89526-031-4 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Physical exercise===
Individuals with low levels of physical activity are at risk for high levels of [[oxidative stress]], as are individuals engaged in highly intensive exercise programs; however individuals engaged in moderately intensive, regular exercise experience lower levels of oxidative stress. High levels of oxidative stress have been linked by some with the increased incidence of a variety of diseases.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.04.004 |title=Exercise, oxidative stress and hormesis |year=2008 |last1=Radak |first1=Zsolt |last2=Chung |first2=Hae Y. |last3=Koltai |first3=Erika |last4=Taylor |first4=Albert W. |last5=Goto |first5=Sataro |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=34–42 |pmid=17869589 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this relationship, characterized by positive effects at an intermediate dose of the stressor (exercise), is characteristic of hormesis.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589/&gt; However, it is important to point out that there is evidence that the oxidative stress associated with intensive exercise may have long-term health benefits. This would imply that oxidative stress, itself, provides an example of hormesis (see section on [[Mitochondrial hormesis]]), but physical exercise does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=Michael |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |pmid=20350594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
{{Main article|Alcohol consumption and health|Alcohol and cancer|Alcohol and cardiovascular disease}}
[[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is believed to be hormetic in preventing heart disease and stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8606 |title=The Importance of Hormesis to Public Health |year=2006 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |last2=Cook |first2=Ralph |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |pmid=17107845 |jstor=4091789 |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=1631–5 |pmc=1665397}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the benefits of light drinking may have been exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/16066350500497983 |laysource=[[University of California, San Francisco]] |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/uoc--isq032706.php |laydate=March 30, 2006 |title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: Systematic error in prospective studies |year=2006 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Kerr |first2=William C. |last3=Stockwell |first3=Tim |last4=Chikritzhs |first4=Tanya |last5=Bostrom |first5=Alan |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.01.005 |title=Moderate Alcohol Use and Reduced Mortality Risk: Systematic Error in Prospective Studies and New Hypotheses |year=2007 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Stockwell |first2=Tim |last3=Chikritzhs |first3=Tanya |last4=Bostrom |first4=Alan |last5=Kerr |first5=William |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=S16–23 |pmid=17478320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers at UCLA found that tiny amounts (1 mM, or 0.005%) of ethanol doubled the lifespan of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a round worm frequently used in biological studies, that were starved of other nutrients. Higher doses of 0.4% provided no longevity benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029984 |title=Caenorhabditis elegans Battling Starvation Stress: Low Levels of Ethanol Prolong Lifespan in L1 Larvae |year=2012 |editor1-last=Singh |editor1-first=Shree Ram |last1=Castro |first1=Paola V. |last2=Khare |first2=Shilpi |last3=Young |first3=Brian D. |last4=Clarke |first4=Steven G. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |pages=e29984 |pmid=22279556 |issue=1 |pmc=3261173 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...7E9984C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, worms exposed to 0.005% did not develop normally (their development was arrested). The authors argue that the worms were using ethanol as an alternative energy source in the absence of other nutrition, or had initiated a stress response. They did not test the effect of ethanol on worms fed a normal diet.

===Methylmercury and mallard eggs===
In 2010, a paper published in the journal ''Environmental Toxicology &amp; Chemistry'' showed that low doses of [[methylmercury]], a potent neurotoxic pollutant, improved the hatching rate of [[mallard]] eggs.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/etc.64 |laysummary=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/56954/title/Fowl_surprise!_Methylmercury_improves_hatching_rate |laysource=Science News |laydate=March 5, 2010 |title=Enhanced reproduction in mallards fed a low level of methylmercury: An apparent case of hormesis |year=2010 |last1=Heinz |first1=Gary H. |last2=Hoffman |first2=David J. |last3=Klimstra |first3=Jon D. |last4=Stebbins |first4=Katherine R. |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=650–3 |pmid=20821490|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229166 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Gary Heinz, who led the study for the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] at the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]] in [[Beltsville]], Md., stated that other explanations are possible. For instance, it is possible that the flock he studied might have harbored some low, subclinical infection and that mercury, well known to be antimicrobial, might have killed the infection that otherwise hurt reproduction in the untreated birds.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490/&gt;

===Effects in aging===
One of the areas where the concept of hormesis has been explored extensively with respect to its applicability is aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-first=Suresh |editor2-last=Rattan |editor2-link=Suresh Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0960327107083409 |title=Principles and practice of hormetic treatment of aging and age-related diseases |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=S. I. |journal=Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=151–4 |pmid=18480141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its [[homeostatic]] ability, [[biogerontologist]]s proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has now gathered a large body of supportive evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure has anti-aging effects.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.03.002 |title=Hormesis in aging |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=Suresh I.S. |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=63–78 |pmid=17964227 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2008.01.001 |title=Stress-Response Hormesis and Aging: "That which Does Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger" |year=2008 |last1=Gems |first1=David |last2=Partridge |first2=Linda |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=200–3 |pmid=18316025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise is a paradigm for hormesis in this respect.&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt; Some of the mild stresses used for such studies on the application of hormesis in aging research and interventions are [[heat shock]], irradiation, [[Pro-oxidant|prooxidants]], [[hypergravity]] and food restriction.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-last=Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other natural and synthetic molecules, such as [[celastrol]]s from medicinal herbs and [[curcumin]] from the spice [[turmeric]] have also been found to have hormetic beneficial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1354.056 |title=Curcumin's Biphasic Hormetic Response on Proteasome Activity and Heat-Shock Protein Synthesis in Human Keratinocytes |year=2006 |last1=Ali |first1=R.

===Mitochondria{{anchor|Mitohormesis}}===
[[Mitochondria]] are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a source of chemical energy. [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) have been regarded as unwanted by-products of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in mitochondria by the proponents of the free-radical theory of aging promoted by [[Denham Harman]]. The [[free-radical theory]] suggests that the use of compounds which inactivate ROS, such as [[antioxidant]]s, would lead to a reduction of oxidative stress and thereby produce an increase in lifespan.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

ROS may perform an essential and potentially lifespan-promoting role as [[redox signaling]] molecules which transduce signals from the mitochondrial compartment to other compartments of the cell.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20350594 |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=M |last2=Zarse |first2=K |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |journal=Experimental Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased formation of ROS within the mitochondria may cause an adaptive reaction which produces increased stress resistance and a long-term reduction of oxidative stress. This kind of reverse effect of the response to ROS stress has been named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis and is hypothesized to be responsible for the respective lifespan-extending and health-promoting capabilities of glucose restriction and physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"/&gt;

Hormesis may also be induced by [[endogenous]]ly produced, potentially toxic agents. For example, [[mitochondria]] consume [[oxygen]] which generates [[free radical]]s ([[reactive oxygen species]]) as a by-product. It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that such free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in increased defense capacity against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.009 |title=Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary phytonutrients: "Mitohormesis" for health and vitality |year=2006 |last1=Tapia |first1=Patrick C. |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=832–43 |pmid=16242247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of endogenous free radical production extends [[life expectancy|life span]] of a model organism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinto |first1=Silas |last2=Sato |first2=Vitor N. |last3=De-Souza |first3=Evandro A. |last4=Ferraz |first4=Rafael C. |last5=Camara |first5=Henrique |last6=Pinca |first6=Ana Paula F. |last7=Mazzotti |first7=Diego R. |last8=Lovci |first8=Michael T. |last9=Tonon |first9=Guilherme |last10=Lopes-Ramos |first10=Camila M. |last11=Parmigiani |first11=Raphael B. |last12=Wurtele |first12=Martin |last13=Massirer |first13=Katlin B. |last14=Mori |first14=Marcelo A. |title=Enoxacin extends lifespan of  C. elegans  by inhibiting  miR-34-5p  and promoting mitohormesis |journal=Redox Biology |date=September 2018 |volume=18 |pages=84–92 |doi=10.1016/j.redox.2018.06.006|pmid=29986212 |pmc=6037660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most importantly, this extension of life span is prevented by [[antioxidant]]s, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.011 |title=Glucose Restriction Extends Caenorhabditis elegans Life Span by Inducing Mitochondrial Respiration and Increasing Oxidative Stress |year=2007 |last1=Schulz |first1=Tim J. |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |last3=Voigt |first3=Anja |last4=Urban |first4=Nadine |last5=Birringer |first5=Marc |last6=Ristow |first6=Michael |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=280–93 |pmid=17908557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mitochondrial activity was found to be increased in the previously mentioned studies, this effect cannot be explained by an excess of free radicals that might mark mitochondria for destruction by [[lysosome]]s, with the free radicals acting as a signal within the cell to indicate which mitochondria are ready for destruction, as proposed by [[Nick Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Lane | title = Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = November 17, 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-920564-6 }}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this concept applies to humans remains to be shown, although recent [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] findings support the process of mitohormesis, and even suggest that some [[antioxidant]] supplements may increase disease [[prevalence]] in humans.&lt;ref name=Bjelakovic&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |title=Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |year=2007 |last1=Bjelakovic |first1=Goran |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |pmid=17327526 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionizing radiation{{anchor|Ionizing Radiation}}===
{{see also|Radiation hormesis}}
Hormesis has been observed in a number of cases in humans and animals exposed to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation. In Taiwan recycled [[Radiation contamination|radiocontaminated]] steel was inadvertently used in the construction of over 100 apartment buildings causing the long-term (10 years) exposure of 10,000 people. The average dose rate was 50 mSv/year and a subset of the population (1,000 people) received a total dose of over 4,000 mSv over ten years. In the widely used [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear No Threshold]] (LNT) theory used by regulatory bodies, the expected cancer deaths in this population would have been 302 with 70 caused by the extra ionizing radiation with the remainder caused by natural background radiation. However the observed cancer rate was quite low at 7 cancer deaths when 232 would be predicted by the LNT theory. Ionizing radiation hormesis appears to be at work. Described by Professor Charles L. Sanders, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles L. Sanders |title=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption |journal=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption by Charles L Sanders |date=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-03719-1 |page=47|bibcode=2010rhln.book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (first study) ====
Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983–2002. The results suggest that prolonged low dose-rate radiation exposure appeared to increase risks of developing certain cancers in specific subgroups of this population in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Guo HR, Hsieh WA, Hwang JS, Lee SD, Tang JL, Chen CC, Chang TC, Wang JD, Chang WP |title=Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983-2002 |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=849–58 |year=2006 |pmid=17178625 |doi=10.1080/09553000601085980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (second study, two years later) ====
A significant radiation risk was observed for leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR(100mGy) 1.19, 90% CI 1.01-1.31). Breast cancer exhibited a marginally significant dose response (HR(100mGy) 1.12, 90% CI 0.99-1.21). The results further strengthen the association between protracted low-dose radiation and cancer risks, especially for breast cancers and leukemia, in this unique cohort population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Hwang JS, Yang YT, Hsieh WA, Chang TC, Guo HR, Tsai MH, Tang JL, Lin IF, Chang WP |title=Estimates of relative risks for cancers in a population after prolonged low-dose-rate radiation exposure: a follow-up assessment from 1983 to 2005 |journal=Radiation Research |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18666807 |doi=10.1667/RR0732.1 |bibcode=2008RadR..170..143H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and ionizing radiation combined{{anchor|Combined effects}}===
No experiment can be performed in perfect isolation. Thick lead shielding around a chemical dose experiment to rule out the effects of ionizing radiation is built and rigorously controlled for in the laboratory, and certainly not the field. Likewise the same applies for ionizing radiation studies. Ionizing radiation is released when an unstable particle releases radiation, creating two new substances and energy in the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]]. The resulting materials are then free to interact with any environmental elements, and the energy released can also be used as a catalyst in further ionizing radiation interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs371/en/|title=Ionizing radiation, health effects and protective measures|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting confusion in the low dose exposure field (radiation and chemical) arise from lack of consideration of this concept as described by Mothersill and Seymory.&lt;ref name=Mothersill&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mothersill C, Seymour C |title=Implications for environmental health of multiple stressors |journal=Journal of Radiological Protection |volume=29 |issue=2A |pages=A21–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19454807 |doi=10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S02 |bibcode = 2009JRP....29...21M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothersill and Seymory state "Most of the arguments about whether radiation is 'good for you' or 'bad for you' fail due to lack of consideration of the hierarchical level at which the effect occurs and because most of the arguments are [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. For example cell death is seen as a 'bad' effect but if it removes a potentially carcinogenic cell from the population of cells in a tissue it could prevent cancer starting and could be seen as 'good'."{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Controversy==
Whether hormesis is common or important is controversial. At least one peer-reviewed article accepts the idea, claiming that over 600 substances show a U-shaped [[dose-response]] relationship. Calaberese and Baldwin wrote: "One percent (195 out of 20,285) of the published articles contained 668 dose-response relationships that met the entry criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calabrese EJ, Baldwin LA |title=The frequency of U-shaped dose responses in the toxicological literature |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=330–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11452146 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/62.2.330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that low dose effects may be (sometimes strikingly) different is accepted, but that the low dose effect is positive is questionable.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The hypothesis of hormesis has generated the most controversy when applied to [[ionizing radiation]]. This theory is called [[radiation hormesis]]. For policy making purposes, the commonly accepted model of dose response in radiobiology is the [[linear no-threshold]] model (LNT), which assumes a strictly linear dependence between the risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects and radiation dose.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The [[United States National Research Council]] (part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, National Research Council |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html |title=Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2 |year=2005 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-09156-5}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]])&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 |title=Evaluation of the Linear-Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model for Ionizing Radiation |publisher=National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-929600-69-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation (UNSCEAR) all agree that radiation hormesis is not clearly shown, nor clearly the rule for radiation doses.

A report commissioned by the French National Academy concluded that there is sufficient evidence for hormesis occurring at low doses and that LNT should be reconsidered as the methodology used to estimate risks from low level sources of radiation, like [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] for [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name="french"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.06.013 |title=Dose–effect relationship and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation: The joint report of the Académie des Sciences (Paris) and of the Académie Nationale de Médecine |year=2005 |last1=Tubiana |first1=Maurice |journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=317–9 |pmid=16168825}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] states that there is insufficient evidence for radiation hormesis and that radiation protection authorities should continue to apply the LNT model for purposes of risk estimation.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"/&gt;
&lt;!--

This should be moved to Radiation hormesis; however it would be good to find another source, since the NRCP report is not freely available and I can't verify what exactly it says about RH.

They conclude that the [[linear no threshold model]] that is effective at high doses, and which predicts that the chance of causing cancer is always linearly proportional to the amount of radiation an individual receives, should be used at low doses too. The report squarely rejects almost all research showing radiation induced hormesis as being flawed in some way (e.g. the cancer a study focuses on does not exist in humans, a clear threshold could not be established in humans, the assumptions are seriously flawed, the hormetic effect is too short to be useful).

Radiation hormesis is not generally accepted by The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), its U.S. counterpart, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), the National Research Council Committees on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (the BEIR Committees), or the U.S. regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q299.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{dead link}} "Information on hormesis"]. Health Physics Society.  Retrieved 26-Feb-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|note: that ref is dead, and this: http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-1.pdf indicates that HPS does not accept LNT for estimation of risk for low doses; the document says that )

Reasons include:
*No well-documented long-term positive effects of hormetic concentrations of toxins.
*Hormesis is counterintuitive.
*Concern about [[publication bias]]; studies that show positive effects might be more likely to be published.
*While some toxins might indeed have different effects at low doses, it is not clear if the effects tend to be positive.}}
--&gt;

==Policy consequences==
Regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) traditionally use a [[linear no-threshold model]] for carcinogens (including radiation). In the linear model, the assumption is that there is no dosage that has no risk of causing cancer. While this linear approach remains the default {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, with sufficient [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic evidence]] suggesting a non-linear dose-response, EPA allows for the derivation of a threshold dose (also known as reference dose) below which it is assumed that there is no risk for cancer.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

While proponents of hormesis argue that changing to a hormesis model would likely change exposure standards for these toxicants in [[air]], [[water]], [[food]] and [[soil]], making the standards less strict, other scientists point out that low dose stimulation can have extremely adverse effects. Similarly, low doses of the [[phthalate]] [[DEHP]] cause increased allergic responses to [[allergen]]s, while higher doses have no effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Wider use of the hormesis model would affect how scientists design and conduct studies and the selection of models that estimate risk. In all likelihood, recognizing that low dose effects can't be predicted from high dose experiments would force a strengthening of public health standards, not their weakening, as hormesis proponents would argue.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Any policy change ought to consider hormesis first as a public health issue (versus an industrial regulatory issue). This would include the assessment of the public concern regarding exposure to small toxic doses. In addition, impact of hormesis policy change upon the management of industrial risks should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Poumadere, M. (2003).

'''Jamaica ginger''' extract, known in the [[United States]] by the slang name '''"Jake,"''' was a late 19th-century [[patent medicine]] that provided a convenient way to bypass [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, since it contained between 70% and 80% [[ethanol]] by weight.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==History==
The [[U.S. Treasury Department]], which administered the Prohibition laws, recognized Jake's potential as an illicit alcohol source, and because of this, it required changes in the solids content of Jake to discourage drinking. The minimum requirement of [[ginger]] solids per cubic centimeter of alcohol resulted in a fluid that was extremely bitter and difficult to drink.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Occasionally, [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] inspectors would test shipments of Jake by boiling the solution and weighing the remaining solid residue. In an effort to trick regulators, [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s replaced the ginger solids{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} with a small amount of ginger and either [[castor oil]] or [[molasses]].

A pair of amateur chemists and bootleggers, Harry Gross and Max Reisman,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} worked to develop an alternative adulterant that would pass the tests, but still be somewhat palatable. They sought advice from a professor{{whom|date=October 2018}} at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] who did not realize it was meant for internal consumption. They settled on a [[plasticizer]], [[tricresyl phosphate|tri-o-tolyl phosphate]] (also known as tri-ortho cresyl phosphate, TOCP, or [[tricresyl phosphate]]), that was able to pass the Treasury Department's tests but preserved Jake's drinkability. TOCP was originally thought to be non-toxic; however, it was later determined to be a neurotoxin that causes axonal damage to the nerve cells in the [[nervous system]] of human beings, especially those located in the [[spinal cord]]. The resulting type of paralysis is now referred to as [[organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy]], or OPIDN.

In 1930, large numbers of Jake users began to lose the use of their hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsok.com/article/3849680/jake-leg-epidemic-first-reported-by-oklahoma-city-doctors&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims could walk, but they had no control over the muscles which would normally have enabled them to point their toes upward. Therefore, they would raise their feet high with the toes flopping downward, which would touch the pavement first followed by their heels. The toe first, heel second pattern made a distinctive "tap-click, tap-click" sound as they walked. This very peculiar gait became known as the '''jake walk''' and those afflicted were said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to have '''jake leg,''' '''jake foot,''' or '''jake paralysis.''' Additionally, the calves of the legs would soften and hang down and the muscles between the thumbs and fingers would atrophy.

Within a few months, the TOCP-adulterated Jake was identified as the cause of the paralysis,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} and the contaminated Jake was recovered. But by that time, it was too late for many victims. Some did recover full, or partial, use of their limbs. But for most, the loss was permanent. The total number of victims was never accurately determined, but is frequently quoted as between 30,000 and 50,000. Many victims were [[immigration|immigrants]] to the United States, and most were poor, with little political or social influence. The victims received very little assistance.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Several [[blues]] songs on the subject were recorded in the early 1930s, such as "Jake Walk Papa" by [[Asa Martin]], "Jake Leg Blues" by  the [[Mississippi Sheiks]], "Alcohol and Jake Blues" by [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], "Jake Jigga Juke" by [[Iron Mike Norton]], and "Jake Liquor Blues" by [[Ishman Bracey]].

Although this incident became well known,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} later cases of organophosphate poisoning occurred in Germany, Spain, Italy, and, on a large scale, in Morocco in 1959, where cooking oil adulterated with jet engine lubricant from an American airbase led to paralysis in approximately 10,000 victims, and caused an international incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

*  In his autobiography ''[[On the Move: A Life]],'' [[Oliver Sacks]] describes research that he conducted to develop an animal model of jake paralysis.  He was able to duplicate the toxic effects of TOCP on myelinated neurons in earthworms and chickens.
*  In Jamie Ford's novel ''[[Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet]]'' the two young characters Henry and Keiko are given a prescription for Jamaican Ginger in the 1942 portion of the story. They go to the pharmacy, pick up the bottles, and return to the Black Elks club. Due to war rationing and systemic oppression at the time, the black jazz club is not allowed to have a liquor license, so the proprietor uses Jamaican Ginger to make bathtub gin.

=== Music ===
Songs were recorded at the time about "jake" and its effects; in a variety of musical styles, including [[blue music|blues]] and [[country music|country]]. Several have been included on the compilation albums ''Jake Walk Blues'' (1977, 14 songs)&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release |release=2099447 |name=Various{{snd}}Jake Walk Blues, Stash Records ST 110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jake Leg Blues'' (1994, 16 songs)&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release |release=5374288 |name= Various{{snd}}Jake Leg Blues, Jass Records J-CD-642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Allmusic |class=album |id=jake-leg-blues-mw0000171317 |label=Various Artists: Jake Leg Blues |accessdate=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a marked but unsurprising duplication of songs between those albums.

'''Life-cycle assessment''' ('''LCA''', also known as '''life-cycle analysis''', '''ecobalance''', and '''cradle-to-grave analysis''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdrc.org/uem/lca/lca-define.html "Defining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 17 October 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Designers use this process to help critique their products. LCAs can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental concerns by:
* Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases;
* Evaluating the potential impacts associated with identified inputs and releases;
* Interpreting the results to help make a more informed decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/lca/lca.html "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 6 August 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and purpose==

The goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/400/life-cycle-assessment-lca-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used to improve processes, support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions.&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"&gt;[http://ecometrica.com/services/#lca "GHG Product Life Cycle Assessments"]. ''Ecometrica''. Retrieved on: 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''life cycle'' refers to the notion that a fair, [[holistic]] assessment requires the assessment of raw-material production, manufacture, [[Sustainable distribution|distribution]], use and [[Waste management|disposal]] including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product's existence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

There are two main types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to establish (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, at a point in time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118063849/http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}, United Nations Environment Programme, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as a different approach to [[Life Cycle Thinking|life cycle thinking]] intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The procedures of life cycle assessment (LCA) are part of the [[ISO 14000]] environmental management standards: in ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006. (ISO 14044 replaced earlier versions of ISO 14041 to ISO 14043.) [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as [[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 2050 and the [[Carbon emissions reporting#Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 28GHGP.29|GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard]].&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/forms/PASs/PAS-2050 "PAS 2050:2011 Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services"]. ''BSI''. Retrieved on: 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/product-standard "Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509224311/http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/product-standard |date=9 May 2013 }}.

==Four main phases==
[[File:PhasesOfLifeCycleAnalysis.png|250px|right|thumb|Illustration of LCA phases]]

According to the ISO 14040&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14040 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; and 14044&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14044 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Requirements and guidelines, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; standards, a Life Cycle Assessment is carried out in four distinct phases as illustrated in the figure shown to the right. The phases are often interdependent in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Goal and scope===

An LCA starts with an explicit statement of the goal and scope of the study, which sets out the context of the study and explains how and to whom the results are to be communicated. This is a key step and the ISO standards require that the goal and scope of an LCA be clearly defined and consistent with the intended application. The goal and scope document therefore includes technical details that guide subsequent work:
* '''the functional unit''', which defines what precisely is being studied and quantifies the service delivered by the product system, providing a reference to which the inputs and outputs can be related. Further, the functional unit is an important basis that enables alternative goods, or services, to be compared and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Rebitzer, G. et al. (2004). Life cycle assessment
Part 1: Framework, goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, and applications. Environment International. 30(2004), 701-720.&lt;/ref&gt; So to explain this a functional system which is inputs, processes and outputs contains a functional unit, that fulfills a function, for example paint is covering a wall, making a functional unit of 1m² covered for 10 years. The functional flow would be the items necessary for that function, so this would be a brush, tin of paint and the paint itself. 
* '''the system boundaries'''; which are delimitations of which processes that should be included in the analysis of a product system.&lt;ref&gt;Finnveden, G., Hauschild, M.Z., Ekvall, T., Guinée, J., Heijungs, R., Hellweq, S., Koehler, A., Pennington, D. &amp; Suh, S. (2009). Recent developments in Life Cycle Assessment.
Journal of Environmental Management 91(1), 1-21. 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''any assumptions and limitations''';{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* '''the allocation methods''' used to partition the environmental load of a process when several products or functions share the same process; allocation is commonly dealt with in one of three ways: system expansion, substitution and partition. Doing this is not easy and different methods may give different results{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

and
* '''the impact categories''' chosen for example human [[toxicity]], [[smog]], [[global warming]], [[eutrophication]].

===Life cycle inventory===
[[File:LCI Diagram.png|thumb|This is an example of a Life-cycle inventory (LCI) diagram]]

Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The data must be related to the functional unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can be presented in tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage. The results of the inventory is an LCI which provides information about all inputs and outputs in the form of elementary flow to and from the environment from all the unit processes involved in the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Inventory flows can number in the hundreds depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care has to be taken to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

One area where data access is likely to be difficult is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbach, V. and Wellmer, F. (May 2010). "Review: Consumption and Use of Non-Renewable Mineral and Energy Raw Materials from an Economic Geology Point of View." Sustainability. 2(5), pgs. 1408-1430. Retrieved from &lt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/5/1408&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as a means to an end will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===LCI Methods===
* Process LCA
* Economic Input Output LCA
* Hybrid Approach

===Life cycle impact assessment===

Inventory analysis is followed by impact assessment. This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the LCI flow results. Classical life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) consists of the following mandatory elements:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* selection of impact categories, category indicators, and characterization models;
* the classification stage, where the inventory parameters are sorted and assigned to specific impact categories; and
* impact measurement, where the categorized LCI flows are characterized, using one of many possible LCIA methodologies, into common equivalence units that are then summed to provide an overall impact category total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In many LCAs, characterization concludes the LCIA analysis; this is also the last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044:2006. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, other optional LCIA elements – [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]], grouping, and weighting – may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest, the U.S. for example. [[Grouped data|Grouping]] consists of sorting and possibly [[ranking]] the impact categories. During [[weighting]], the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044:2006 generally advises against weighting, stating that “weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public”. This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development, production, use, and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking, these impacts can be divided into "First Impacts,"&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Brian D. Future-Proof Building Materials: A Life Cycle Analysis. Intersections and Adjacencies. Proceedings of the 2015 Building Educators’ Society Conference, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Gines, Jacob, Carraher, Erin, and Galarze, Jose, editors. Pp. 123-130.&lt;/ref&gt; use impacts, and end of life impacts. "First Impacts" include extraction of raw materials, manufacturing (conversion of raw materials into a product), transportation of the product to a market or site, construction/installation, and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility (such as energy, water, etc.), maintenance, renovation and repairs (required to continue to use the product or facility). End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Interpretation===

Life Cycle Interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, quantify, check, and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and/or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO 14040:2006, the interpretation should include:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* identification of significant issues based on the results of the LCI and LCIA phases of an LCA;
* evaluation of the study considering completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks; and
* conclusions, limitations and recommendations.

A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as "3 is better than 2, therefore Alternative A is the best choice"! Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, [[Sensitivity analysis|evaluating the sensitivity]] of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Reference test====

More specifically, the best alternative is the one that the LCA shows to have the least cradle-to-grave environmental negative impact on land, sea, and air resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curran |first=Mary Ann |title=Life Cycle Analysis: Principles and Practice |url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |publisher=Scientific Applications International Corporation |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018024516/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LCA uses==

Based on a survey of LCA practitioners carried out in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cooper | first = J.S. | last2 = Fava | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Life Cycle Assessment Practitioner Survey: Summary of Results
 | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | doi = 10.1162/jiec.2006.10.4.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
LCA is mostly used to support business strategy (18%) and R&amp;D (18%), as input to product or process design (15%), in education (13%) and for labeling or product declarations (11%). LCA will be continuously integrated into the built environment as tools such as the European ENSLIC Building project guidelines for buildings or developed and implemented, which provide practitioners guidance on methods to implement LCI data into the planning and design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmqvist|first=T|last2=Glaumann|first2=M| last3= Scarpellini|first3=S|last4=Zabalza|first4=I|last5=Aranda|first5=A|title=Life cycle assessment in buildings: The ENSLIC simplified method and guidelines|journal=Energy|date=April 2011|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1900–1907|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544210001453|accessdate=31 October 2012|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major corporations all over the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as "quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information".&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenstandard.org/EPD_System.html EPD_System] – '''www.thegreenstandard.org'''&lt;/ref&gt; These third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry. Independent certification can show a company's dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

LCA also has major roles in [[environmental impact assessment]], integrated [[waste management]] and pollution studies. A recent study evaluated the LCA of a laboratory scale plant for oxygen enriched air production coupled with its economic evaluation in an holistic eco-design standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galli|first=F|last2=Pirola|first2=C| last3= Previtali|first3=D|last4=Manenti|first4=F|last5=Bianchi|first5=C|title=Eco design LCA of an innovative lab scale plant for the production of oxygen-enriched air.

==Data analysis==

A life cycle analysis is only as valid as its [[data]]; therefore, it is crucial that data used for the completion of a life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, it is crucial that equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Scientific Applications International Corporation |title=Life cycle assessment: principles and practice |page=88 |date=May 2006 |url=http://www.epa.gov/NRMRL/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf 
 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123001105/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf |archivedate=23 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of LCA data – unit process data and environmental input-output data (EIO), where the latter is based on national economic input-output data.&lt;ref name=greet/&gt; Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest, carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data validity is an ongoing concern for life cycle analyses. Due to [[globalization]] and the rapid pace of [[research and development]], new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected, data validity is not a problem. However, [[consumer electronics]] such as [[cell phones]] can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29258026/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/planned-obsolescence-cell-phone-models/|title=Planned obsolescence: cell phone models | author= Suzanne Choney|date=24 February 2009|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a need for ongoing data collection.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The life cycle considered usually consists of a number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or [[manufacturing cost]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data sources are typically large databases, it is not appropriate to compare two options if different data sources have been used to source the data. 
Data sources include:
* soca
* EuGeos' 15804-IA
* NEEDS
* ecoinvent
* PSILCA
* ESU World Food
* GaBi

Calculations for impact can then be done by hand, but it is more usual to streamline the process by using software. This can range from a simple spreadsheet, where the user enters the data manually to a fully automated program, where the user is not aware of the source data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Variants==

===Cradle-to-grave===

Cradle-to-grave is the full Life Cycle Assessment from resource extraction ('cradle') to use phase and disposal phase ('grave'). For example, trees produce paper, which can be recycled into low-energy production [[cellulose]] (fiberised paper) [[Building insulation|insulation]], then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy used in its production. After 40 years the [[cellulose]] fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Cradle-to-gate===

Cradle-to-gate is an assessment of a ''partial'' product life cycle from resource extraction (''cradle'') to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for [[environmental product declarations]] (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environdec.com/pageId.asp?id=301&amp;menu=2,2,26 EPD-The Green Yardstick]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin Associates, A Division of Eastern Research Group|title=Cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|publisher=The Plastics Division of the American Chemistry Council|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206012658/http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cradle-to-cradle or closed loop production===
{{see also|Cradle to Cradle Design}}

Cradle-to-cradle is a specific kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a [[recycling]] process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development.&lt;ref&gt;"Cradle-to-cradle definition." Ecomii. 19 October 2010. Web. &lt;http://www.ecomii.com/ecopedia/cradle-to-cradle&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods, such as the [[avoided burden]] approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Gate-to-gate===

Gate-to-gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value-added process in the entire production chain. Gate-to-gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle-to-gate evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez-González, C.; Kim, S.; Overcash, M. Methodology for developing gate-to-gate Life cycle inventory information. The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 2000, 5, 153–159.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well-to-wheel===

Well-to-wheel is the specific LCA used for [[transport]] [[fuel]]s and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled "well-to-station", or "well-to-tank", and "station-to-wheel" or "tank-to-wheel", or "plug-to-wheel". The first stage, which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission, and is called the "upstream" stage, while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the "downstream" stage. The well-to-wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption, or the [[energy conversion efficiency]] and [[Exhaust gas|emission]]s impact of [[marine vessel]]s, [[aircraft]] and [[motor vehicle]]s, including their [[carbon footprint]], and the fuels used in each of these transport modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/339.pdf|title=Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced Fuel/Vehicle Systems — A North American Study of Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Criteria Pollutant Emissions|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|first1=Norman|last1= Brinkman|first2=Michael|last2=Wang|first3=Trudy |last3= Weber|first4=Thomas|last4=Darlington|date=May 2005|accessdate=28 February 2011}} ''See EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – ES.1 Background, pp1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Electrification - Quo Vadis|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987248_Vehicle_Electrification_-_Quo_Vadis__Fahrzeugelektrifizierung_-_Quo_Vadis | last1=Brinkman| first1=Norman| first2=Ulrich| last2=Eberle|first3=Volker|last3=Formanski|first4=Uwe-Dieter|last4=Grebe|first5=Roland|last5=Matthe|publisher=[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] |date=15 April 2012| accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-600-2007-004/CEC-600-2007-004-REV.PDF|title=Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-To-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impacts|publisher=California Energy Commission|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |title=Green Car Glossary: Well to wheel |publisher=[[Car Magazine]] |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504030517/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |archivedate= 4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages, giving a more complete picture of real emissions.

The well-to-wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, [[greenhouse gas emission]]s, and six additional pollutants: [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitrogen oxide]] (NOx), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] with size smaller than 10 micrometre (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5), and [[sulfur oxide]]s (SOx).&lt;ref name=greet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greet.es.anl.gov/|title=How Does GREET Work?|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative values of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a [[Battery Electric Vehicle]] in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) finds out that an electric vehicle can save the 50-60% of GHG &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles | journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment | doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while an hybrid LCA-WTW method, considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emission savings 10-13% lower, compared to the WTW. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4.|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic input–output life cycle assessment===

Economic input–output LCA ([[EIOLCA]]) involves use of aggregate sector-level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005). ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input–Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press {{ISBN|1-933115-24-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net/Method/Limitations.html Limitations of the EIO-LCA Method and Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecologically based LCA===

While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco-LCA, the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience, Eco-LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services.&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Singh |author2=B. R. Bakshi |title=Eco-LCA: A Tool for Quantifying the Role of Ecological Resources in LCA|doi=10.1109/ISSST.2009.5156770 |journal= International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology|year= 2009|pages=1–6|isbn=978-1-4244-4324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exergy based LCA ==
[[Exergy]] of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, M. A., &amp; Dincer, I. (2001).

concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported
and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Life cycle energy analysis==

Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is an approach in which all [[energy]] inputs to a product are accounted for, not only direct energy inputs during manufacture, but also all energy inputs needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was ''energy analysis''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

With LCEA, the ''total life cycle energy input'' is established.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Energy production===
{{see|energy production}}
It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves, such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[photovoltaic]]
[[electricity]] or high-quality [[petroleum products]]. ''Net energy content'' is the energy content of the product minus energy input used
during extraction and [[energy conversion|conversion]], directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing
[[solar cell]]s requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The result was refuted.&lt;ref&gt;David MacKay [http://www.withouthotair.com/ Sustainable Energy] 24 February 2010 p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is [[Energy Cannibalism]]. Energy Cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid
growth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for [[energy]] that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power
plants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the [[embodied energy]] of
future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy (alongside full LCA) impacts of a number of renewable technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McManus, M |title=Life cycle impacts of waste wood biomass heating systems: A case study of three UK based systems|journal= Energy |volume =35|issue =10|year=2010|pages =4064–4070|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, S.R., G.P.

===Energy recovery===
{{see|energy recovery}}
If materials are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for [[electricity production]]. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with [[coal]] and natural gas&lt;ref&gt;Damgaard, A, et al. ''Life-cycle-assessment of the historical development of air pollution control and energy recovery in waste incineration.'' Waste Management 30 (2010) 1244–1250.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[incineration]] produces more [[greenhouse gas]] emissions than [[landfilling]], the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when [[landfill gas]] is recovered for electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;Liamsanguan, C., Gheewala, S.H., ''LCA: A decision support tool for environmental assessment of MSW management systems.'' Jour. of Environ. Mgmt. 87 (2009) 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and that it should not be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} For example, simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammond | first = Geoffrey P. | title = Engineering sustainability: thermodynamics, energy systems, and the environment | journal = [[International Journal of Energy Research]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 613–639 | year = 2004 | url = http://www.etcs.ipfw.edu/~mueller/me427/Engineering_sustainability.pdf| doi = 10.1002/er.988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Incorporating '''Dynamic LCAs''' of renewable energy technologies (using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pehnt | first = Martin | title = Dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable energy technologies | journal = Renewable Energy: an International Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–71 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the literature on life cycle assessment of [[energy technology]] has begun to reflect the interactions between the current [[electrical grid]] and future [[energy technology]]. Some papers have focused on [[energy]] life cycle,&lt;ref name="Pearce2"&gt;J.M. Pearce, [http://me.queensu.ca/people/pearce/publications/documents/asp3.pdf "Optimizing Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Strategies to Suppress Energy Cannibalism"] 2nd Climate Change Technology Conference Proceedings, p. 48, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joshua M.

If this is not done, a given class of [[energy technology]] may emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over its lifetime than it mitigates.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A problem the energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms ([[heat]], [[electricity]], [[chemical energy]] etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, as a consequence of the two main laws of [[thermodynamics]]. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is [[exergy]]. According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the [[second law of thermodynamics|second law]] diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The conflict is resolved in one of these ways:
* value difference between energy inputs is ignored,
* a value ratio is arbitrarily assigned (e.g., a [[joule]] of [[electricity]] is 2.6 times more valuable than a joule of heat or fuel input),
* the analysis is supplemented by economic (monetary) cost analysis,
* [[exergy]] instead of energy can be the metric used for the life cycle analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cornelissen | first = Reinerus Louwrentius | title = Thermodynamics and sustainable development; the use of exergy analysis and the reduction of irreversibility | year = 1997|work=Thesis, University of Twente, Netherlands | url = http://doc.utwente.nl/32030/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing [[wikt:commensurable|commensurable]] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the [[boundary critique]] to [[systems thinking]]. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on [[average]]s, [[Sampling error|unrepresentative sampling]], or outdated results.&lt;ref&gt;Malin, Nadav, [http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2002/3/1/Life-Cycle-Assessment-for-Buildings-Seeking-the-Holy-Grail/?&amp;printable=yes Life-cycle assessment for buildings: Seeking the Holy Grail.] Building Green, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Gaines and Frank Stodolsky [http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/104.pdf Life-Cycle Analysis: Uses and Pitfalls]. Argonne National Laboratory. Transportation Technology R&amp;D Center&lt;/ref&gt; There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Streamline LCA===

This process includes three steps.
First, a proper method should be selected to combine adequate accuracy with acceptable cost burden in order to guide decision making. Actually, in LCA process, besides streamline LCA, Eco-screening and complete LCA are usually considered as well. However, the former one only could provide limited details and the latter one with more detailed information is more expensive.
Second, single measure of stress should be selected. Typical LCA output includes [[resource consumption]], energy consumption, water consumption, emission of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], toxic residues and so on. One of these outputs is used as the main factor to measure in streamline LCA. Energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission are often regarded as “practical indicators”.
Last, stress selected in step 2 is used as standard to assess phase of life separately and identify the most damaging phase. For instance, for a family car, energy consumption could be used as the single stress factor to assess each phase of life. The result shows that the most energy intensive phase for a family car is the usage stage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

: 
'''Limmu''' was an [[Assyria]]n [[eponym]]. At the beginning of the reign of an Assyrian king, the limmu, an appointed royal official, would preside over the New Year festival at the capital. Each year a new limmu would be chosen.  Although picked by lot, there was most likely a limited group, such as the men of the most prominent families or perhaps members of the city assembly.  The Assyrians used the name of the limmu for that year to designate the year on official documents. Lists of limmus have been found accounting for every year between 892 BC and 648 BC.

During the [[Assyria|Old Assyrian]] period, the king himself was never the ''limmum'', as it was called in their language.  In the [[Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]] periods, however, the king could take this office.

[[File:Marc Shapiro picture 5.jpg|thumb|Marc B. Shapiro]]
'''Marc B. Shapiro''' (Hebrew: מלך שפירא, born 1966) is a professor and the author of various books and articles on Jewish history, philosophy, theology, and rabbinic literature.

== Education and career ==
Shapiro received his BA at [[Brandeis University]] and his PhD at [[Harvard University]], where he was the last PhD student of Professor [[Isadore Twersky]]. He received rabbinical ordination from Rabbi [[Ephraim Greenblatt]]. Shapiro's father is [[Edward S. Shapiro]], who has published books on American history and American Jewish history.

Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shapiro is an on-line lecturer for Torah in Motion, for which he also leads Jewish history tours to Europe and Morocco. He often writes for the Seforim Blog.

Shapiro has been a resident of [[West Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Johanna. [http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/060106/njLocalScholarOrganizes.html "Local scholar organizes conference on history of Modern Orthodoxy"], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', June 1, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2018. "A West Orange scholar is the co-organizer of the first-ever conference in America on the history of Modern Orthodoxy, to be held June 13–15 in Scranton, Pa. Marc B. Shapiro, who holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Scranton, said the conference will take a historical view of the movement in order to explore its meaning for today."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Shapiro's writings often challenge the bounds of the conventional Orthodox understanding of Judaism using academic methodology while adhering to Modern Orthodox sensibilities. His book, ''Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy,'' a biography of [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], was a National Jewish Book Award finalist. His second book, ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology'', also a National Jewish Book Award finalist, argued against the conventional Orthodox belief that [[Maimonides]] Thirteen Principles of Faith are unquestionable dogma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/6488/author-challenges-rambam-s-principles/|title=Author Challenges Rambam's Principles|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gidon Rothstein, writing in the Association for Jewish Studies Review, called the book's collection of sources "remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothstein|first=Gidon|date=2005-04-01|title=Marc B. Shapiro. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization.

The book was criticized by some Hareidi Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Zev Leff]], an American [[Haredi Judaism|Hareidi]] rabbi, wrote that "I cannot recommend it to the general public, who can be easily misled by some of the questionable theses in this book."&lt;ref name="Leff"&gt;http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/summer67/76_79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his book ''Changing the Immutable: How Orthodox Judaism Rewrites Its History'' was released. The book documents the phenomenon of internal censorship in Orthodoxy. [[Adam Ferziger]] said the book "is the outstanding product of a master of rabbinic literature and an extraordinarily sharp-eyed and meticulous scholar."&lt;ref&gt;http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-sagacious-scholar-and-the-censor-by-adam-ferziger/&lt;/ref&gt; Yair Hoffman, writing in the Hareidi online website [[Yeshiva World News]], criticized the book, saying that "there is a plethora of material that simply should not have been included in the book because it does not back up his thesis."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/313895/book-review-of-changing-the-immutble.html|title=Book Review: Marc Shapiro's "Changing the Immutable"|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Glinter, writing in [[The Forward]], praised Shapiro's "evenhanded, evidence-heavy approach" and that he was not a "polemicist," but said "his argument could also have benefited from a more critical thrust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/culture/311651/orthodoxys-inconvenient-truths/|title=Orthodoxy's Inconvenient Truths|last=Glinter|first=Ezra|date=2015-07-13|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mean time between coincidences''' ('''MTBC''') is used in [[safety engineering]] and is defined as the reciprocal of the average frequency of dangerous [[coincidence]]s:

&lt;math&gt;MTBC=\frac{1}{\lambda\ _{d}} = \frac{2}{\lambda\ \mu\ \tau\ }&lt;/math&gt;

{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}
'''Metaphysical naturalism''' (also called '''ontological naturalism''', '''philosophical naturalism''', '''scientific materialism''' and '''antisupernaturalism''') is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but [[natural]] elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]].  [[Methodological naturalism]] is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible [[ontology|ontological]] foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or [[spiritual naturalism]]. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].

==Definition==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], geologist and president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that: 1. Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]]; 2. Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; 3. Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism.{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

[[Carl Sagan]] put it succinctly: "The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Danto]], naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the vagueness of the general term "naturalism", [[David Papineau]] traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]: "So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}} Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a "positive" term, and "few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'", while noting that "philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'" and that despite an "inevitable" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of [[John McDowell]], [[David Chalmers]] and [[Jennifer Hornsby]], for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content "to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}}

Philosopher and theologian [[Alvin Plantinga]], a [[evolutionary argument against naturalism|well-known critic of naturalism]] in general, comments: "Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological naturalism===

Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], which deals with existence ''per se''. It should not be confused with [[methodological naturalism]], which sees [[empiricism]] as the basis for the scientific method.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Regarding science and evolution, [[Eugenie C. Scott]], a notable opponent of teaching [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:
{{quote|If it is important for Americans to learn about science and evolution, decoupling the two forms of naturalism is essential strategy. ... I suggest that scientists can defuse some of the opposition to evolution by first recognizing that the vast majority of Americans are believers, and that most Americans want to retain their faith. It is demonstrable that individuals can retain religious beliefs and still accept evolution as science. Scientists should avoid confusing the methodological naturalism of science with metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"/&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|"Creationism, Ideology, and Science"}}

===Lack of necessity for worship===

The historian [[Richard Carrier]], in his book ''Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,'' describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy "wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and naturalism==
{{main article|Uniformitarianism}}
Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) "There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|A.Sergei|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Schafersman]], agrees that methodological naturalism is "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]] in US public schools such as [[Eugenie Scott]], Schafersman asserts that "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} as well as the similarly controversial assertion: "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} On the other hand, Scott argues:
{{quote|that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical [[materialism]]—if we want more Americans to understand evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1996 |chapter="Creationism, Ideology, and Science" |title=The Flight From Science and Reason |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences, |pages=519–520 |editors=Gross, Levitt, and Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=2008 |url=http://ncse.com/religion/science-religion-methodology-humanism |title=Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism}} However, there are other controversies, [[Arthur Newell Strahler]] embeds peculiar [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] distinctions in the name of naturalism: "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Strahler|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variously known as [[background independence]], the [[cosmological principle]], the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or [[uniformitarianism]], there ''are'' important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the out crop of rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1987|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way "prove" the validity of induction—an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's "uniformity of process" are an assumption: "As such, it is another ''a priori'' assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to R. Hooykaas: "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various associated beliefs==
Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism.  Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of [[materialism]] or [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Certainly most philosophical naturalists today are materialists[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undesigned universe===
Metaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities.&lt;ref name=sag&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Carrier |title= Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism |date= 2010-08-09 |publisher= AuthorHouse |location= Bloomington, Indiana |section= Free Preview |accessdate= 2013-12-25 |url=http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000406158/Sense-and-Goodness-Without-God.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Carrier explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.&lt;ref name=sag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.

===Abiogenesis and evolution===
Since nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=166–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life],  ''Biology and Philosophy'' 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists reason about ''how'', not ''if'' evolution happened.  They maintain that humanity's existence is not by [[intelligent design]] but rather a natural process of [[emergence]].

===Ethics and meta-ethics===

Some embrace [[virtue ethics]] and many see no compelling argument against [[ethical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=168–176, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}  Some may advocate for a [[Science of morality]].  One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is [[Richard Carrier]]'s chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers.  It sets out to prove a [[Moral realism]] centered around human satisfaction.  [[Alexander Rosenberg]] has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept [[moral nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Alexander |title=The Disenchanted Naturalist’s Guide to Reality |url=http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |work=On the Human Forum |publisher=National Humanities Center (United States) |authorlink=Alexander Rosenberg |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150034/http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mind is a natural phenomenon===

If any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any [[mental properties]] that exist are [[causality|caused]] by and [[ontology|ontologically]] dependent upon nature.

Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a [[soul]] or [[spirit]], nor in [[ghost]]s, and when explaining what constitutes the [[mind]] they rarely appeal to [[substance dualism]]. If one's mind, or rather one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and existence as a [[person]], is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as [[idea]]s, [[theories]], [[emotions]], moral and personal [[values]], or [[aesthetic]] response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.&lt;ref name="stace3"&gt;Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility of reason===
Metaphysical naturalists hold that [[reason]] is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of [[pure reason]] alone can securely discover logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of society===
Humans are [[social animals]], which is why humanity developed [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

{{also|History of materialism|History of metaphysical realism}}
===Ancient and medieval philosophy===
Naturalism was the foundation of two ([[Vaisheshika]], [[Nyaya]]) of the six orthodox schools and one ([[Carvaka]]) heterodox school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Chatterjee (2012), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass'', {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 227–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Western metaphysical naturalism has originated in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The earliest [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, especially the [[Milesian school|Milesians]] ([[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]) and the [[atomists]] ([[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]), were labeled by their peers and successors "the ''physikoi''" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φυσικός or ''physikos'', meaning "natural philosopher," borrowing on the word φύσις or ''[[physis]]'', meaning "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as [[Epicureanism]], which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a [[Void (philosophy)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the rise and dominance of [[Christianity]] in the West and the later spread of [[Islam]], metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in [[medieval philosophy]]. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.

===Modern philosophy===
It was not until the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern era of philosophy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that naturalists like [[Benedict Spinoza]] (who put forward a theory of [[psychophysical parallelism]]), [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the proponents of [[French materialism]] (notably [[Denis Diderot]], [[Julien La Mettrie]], and [[Baron d'Holbach]]) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, [[materialism]], which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.

[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected ([[reductionist]]) materialist positions in metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not hostile to naturalism. His [[transcendental philosophy]] is considered to be a form of [[liberal naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', a form of [[natural philosophy]], was developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]],&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[dialectical materialism]], especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'').

Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was [[German materialism]]: members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
In the early 20th century, [[matter]] was found to be a form of [[energy]] and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See [[History of physics]].) In [[contemporary philosophy]], renewed attention to the [[problem of universals]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], the development of [[mathematical logic]], and the post-[[logical positivism|positivist]] revival of [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]], initially by way of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] [[linguistic philosophy]], further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the [[philosophy of science]] brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], etc., the products of which include [[physicalism]] and [[eliminative materialism]], [[supervenience]], [[causal theory of reference|causal theories of reference]], [[anomalous monism]], [[naturalized epistemology]] (e.g. [[reliabilism]]), [[internalism and externalism]], [[ethical naturalism]], and [[property dualism]], for example.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Objectivism is an expression of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[ethical idealism]] within a naturalistic framework.

The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the middle of the twentieth century, the acceptance of the causal closure of the physical realm led to even stronger naturalist views. The [[causal closure]] thesis implies that any mental and biological causes must themselves be physically constituted, if they are to produce physical effects. It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1950s onwards, philosophers began to formulate arguments for ontological physicalism. Some of these arguments appealed explicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal closure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that even in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Papineau |first=David |authorlink=David Papineau |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/naturalism/#NatPhy |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N.

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], an advocacy group opposing [[creationism]] in public schools,&lt;ref name="Williams 2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The God curriculum  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/smcreate07.xml&amp;page=2 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |location=London |first=Sally |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its [[explanatory power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism did not exist as a philosophy before the nineteenth century, but only as an occasionally adopted and non-rigorous method among natural philosophers. It is a unique philosophy in that it is not ancient or prior to science, and that it developed largely due to the influence of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism is almost unique in that it would not exist as a philosophy without the prior existence of science. It shares this status, in my view, with the philosophy of existentialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical naturalism==

In the context of creation and evolution debates, [[Internet Infidels]] co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls "the argument from bias", that ''a priori,'' the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes "there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an ''a priori'' assumption".&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"/&gt;

Richard Carrier argues in ''Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism'' that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include [[metaphilosophy]],  [[semantics]], [[epistemology]], the nature and [[origin of the universe]] (including a proposal that [[spacetime]] may be the [[ground of all being]] and [[brute fact|a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer]]),  free will [[compatibilism]], the nature of [[mind]], [[abstract objects]], [[Reductionism#Ontological reductionism|ontological reductionism]], the nature of [[emotions]], the [[meaning of life]], the nature of [[reason]], [[atheism]], [[aesthetics]], [[morality]] (including [[ethical naturalism]] and a recommendation for a [[science of morality]]), and [[politics]].

===Argument from physical minds===

Several Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist.  For instance, Lowder says, "Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/minds.html |title=Argument from Physical Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1999/march.html#Naturalism |date=March 1999 |work=Internet Infidels Newsletter |title=The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism |first=Jeffery Jay |last=Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological argument for naturalism===

{{quote|[Elegance] goes directly to the question of how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step?&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Sagan |first2=T. |last2=Head |year=2006 |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |series=Literary Conversations Series |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=9781578067367 |lccn=2005048747 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Carl Sagan]]|''Conversations with Carl Sagan''}}

==Arguments against==

Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
[[Alvin Plantinga]] is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a [[Christian]], and a well-known critic of naturalism.  He argues, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism|reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God.  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title=Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104024641/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=11 April 2010 |quote=...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |title=Warrant and Proper Function |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507863-2 |at=Chap. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[supernormal stimuli]]).''

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[evil demon]] or [[brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.K. |last=Beilby |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction by Alvin Plantinga |title=Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8763-7 |lccn=2001006111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–2, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities—no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another—and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;|Alvin Plantinga|"Introduction" in ''Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism''}}

Branden Fitelson of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as [[cognitive bias]] are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's [[hyperbolic doubt]] is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: "[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by [[philosophy of mind|philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] and historian [[Richard Carrier]] who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinominalist argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Theory of Forms|Hylomorphism|Scholasticism}}
[[Edward Feser]], in his 2008 book ''The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism'', lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the [[Plato]]nic&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 31-49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 2, pp. 53-72&lt;/ref&gt; answers to the [[problem of universals]]—that is, [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Feser also offers arguments against [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects [[eliminative materialism]]—and thus naturalism.

In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] arguments for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 90-119&lt;/ref&gt; These include arguments for an unmoved mover,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; first, uncaused cause &lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 102-110&lt;/ref&gt; and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-118&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the [[intelligent design]] view, particularly of [[irreducible complexity]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-114&lt;/ref&gt;—but as a necessary consequence of "obvious, though empirical, starting points".&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microfauna''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ''mikros'' "small" + [[New Latin]] ''fauna'' "animal") refers to microscopic organisms that exhibit animal-like qualities.  Microfauna are represented in the [[animal]] kingdom (e.g., [[nematode]]s, small [[arthropod]]s) and the [[protist]] kingdom (i.e., [[protozoan]]s).  This is in contrast to [[microflora]] which, together with microfauna, make up the microzoa.

==Habitat==
Microfauna are present in every habitat on Earth.  They fill essential roles as decomposers and food sources for lower trophic levels, and are necessary to drive processes within larger organisms.

==Role==
One particular example of the role of microfauna can be seen in soil, where they are important in the cycling of nutrients in [[ecosystems]].  Soil microfauna are capable of digesting just about any organic substance, and some inorganic substances (such as [[TNT]] and [[synthetic rubber]]).  
These organisms are often essential links in the food chain between primary producers and larger species. For example, zooplankton are widespread microscopic animals and protists which feed on algae and detritus in the ocean.  They include foraminifora and krill, which are the primary food source for even animals such as whales.  
Microfauna also aid in digestion and other processes in larger organisms.

==Cryptozoa==
The microfauna are the least understood of [[soil life]], due to their small size and great diversity. Many microfauna are members of the so-called [[cryptozoa]], animals that remain undescribed by science. Out of the estimated 10-20 million animal species in the world, only 1.8 million have been given scientific names, and many of the remaining millions are likely microfauna, much of it from the tropics.

[[Image:Nanotough logo.JPG|thumb|alt=The logo of the project.|Nanotough.]]
'''Nanotough''' is a European framework project that focuses on developing tough plastic materials using nanotechnology. A total of 11 partners from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]] and [[Denmark]] are participating in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/ Nanotough.aau.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanotough objectives==
The objective of Nanotough is to obtain a deeper understanding of the interfacial structure of nanocomposites within a [[polyolefin]] matrix and thus use [[nanoparticles]] like nanoclay to turn upside down the construction of a number of well-known products, where today metals or plastics are used in for example cars or aircraft. The project will enable realization of the great performance potential of these materials through development of novel multiphase and hybrid nanocomposites.

The project aims to improve the stiffness of polyolefin nanocomposites while not only maintaining but also improving the toughness of the matrix considerably. The technical objective is to optimize and, through novel [[interface design]], to develop new cost effective hybrid (nanofiller-fibre) nanocomposites as an alternative to heavily filled [[polymers]] and expensive engineering polymers and fulfill industry requirements for high performance materials in high tech applications.
Nanocomposites are emerging new materials that promise improved properties, but in practice, it has been difficult to translate existing knowledge on nanotechnology into tangible products. Nanotough’s objective is, in addition to basic research, to remove the technical barriers so that nano-composite-materials can be used commercially and lead to development of new products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ About Nanotough at Nanotough.aau.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321182036/http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ |date=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis''' is a hypothesis to explain several mammalian traits. In 1942, [[Gordon Lynn Walls]] described this concept which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting with their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|demise of the dinosaurs]] 66 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Gerkema MP, Davies WI, Foster RG, Menaker M, Hut RA.

Proc Biol Sci. 2013 Jul 3;280(1765):20130508. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.0508&lt;/ref&gt; While some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches, the approximately 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology, and most mammals are still nocturnal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sinn|first1=J.|title=New Study Shows Effects of Prehistoric Nocturnal Life on Mammalian Vision|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2012/10/29/effects-prehistoric-nocturnal-life-mammalian-vision/|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of mammals==
[[File:Brasilitherium riograndensis.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|''[[Brasilitherium]]'', a very advanced near-mammalian [[cynodont]], were probably nocturnal burrowers]]
{{main article|Evolution of mammals}}
Mammals evolved from [[cynodont]]s, a group of superficially dog-like [[synapsid|mammal-like reptiles]] in the wake of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic mass extinction]]. The emerging [[archosaur]]ian groups that flourished after the extinction, including [[crocodiles]] and [[dinosaurs]] and their ancestors, drove the remaining larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only the smaller forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|authorlink = Michael Benton|title=Vertebrate palaeontology|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-632-05637-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied [[insectivore|insectivorous]] dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kielan-Jaworowska|first1=Zofia|last2=Cifelli,|first2=Richard L.|last3=Luo|first3=Zhe-Xi|title=Mammals from the age of dinosaurs : origins, evolution, and structure|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11918-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early mammals continued to develop into several probably quite common groups of animals during the [[Mesozoic]], they all remained nocturnal.

Only with the massive extinction at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] did the dinosaurs leave the stage open for the establishment of a new fauna of mammals. Despite this, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Than|first1=K.|title=Rise of Modern Mammals Occurred Long After Dinosaur Demise|url=http://www.livescience.com/7230-rise-modern-mammals-occurred-long-dinosaur-demise.html|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small nocturnal animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gamberale-Stille|first1=G.|last2=Hall|first2=K.

==Mammalian nocturnal adaptions==

Several different features of mammalian physiology appear to be adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle, mainly related to the sensory organs. These include:

===Senses===
* Acute sense of hearing, including external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] and auditory [[ossicles]].
* Very good sense of smell, well developed [[Nasal concha|nasal turbinate]]s.
* Well developed sense of touch, and particularly the [[whiskers]].&lt;ref name=scholarpedia&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Whisking_behavior |title=Vibrissal behaviour and function|journal=Scholarpedia | volume= 6|page=6642 | accessdate=October 29, 2011 | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6642 | year=2011 | last1=Grant | first1=Robyn | last2=Mitchinson | first2=Ben | last3=Prescott | first3=Tony | issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* With the exception of higher primates, very large [[cornea]], giving a less acute visual image compared to birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=M.

===Physiology===
* Unique type of [[brown adipose tissue]], allowing mammals to generate heat quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cannon|first1=B.|title=Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=1 January 2004|volume=84|issue=1|pages=277–359|doi=10.1152/physrev.00015.2003|pmid=14715917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fur to assist in thermo-regulation in a cold (night) environment.
* Lack of shielding mechanism against (diurnal) [[ultraviolet]] light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringvold|first1=Amund|title=Aqueous humour and ultraviolet radiation|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica|date=27 May 2009|volume=58|issue=1|pages=69–82|doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.1980.tb04567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piraeus Lion''' ({{lang-it|Leone del Pireo}}; {{lang-sv|Pireuslejonet}}); is one of four [[lion]] statues on display at the [[Venetian Arsenal]], where it was displayed as a symbol of Venice's patron saint, [[Saint Mark]].

== History ==
It was originally located in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of [[Athens]]. It was looted by Venetian naval commander [[Francesco Morosini]] in 1687 as [[plunder]] taken in the [[Great Turkish War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], during which the Venetians [[Siege of the Acropolis (1687)|captured Athens]] and Morosini's cannons caused damage to the [[Parthenon]] only matched by his subsequent looting.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Athens, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the statue can also be seen at the [[Piraeus Archaeological Museum]] and the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].

The lion was originally sculpted in about 360 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Vermeule, "Greek Funerary Animals, 450-300 B. C.", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''76''':1:49-59 (January 1972), {{jstor|503610}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and became a famous landmark in Piraeus, having stood there since the 1st or 2nd century AD. Its prominence was such that the port eventually became referred to in Italian as Porto Leone ("Lion Port") as the port's original name ceased to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Goette, Hans Rupprecht (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRHY3zWyrcEC Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide]''. [[Routledge]]. p. 141. {{ISBN|0-415-24370-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is depicted in a sitting pose, with a hollow throat and the mark of a pipe (now lost) running down its back; this suggests that it was originally used as a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Henry (1833). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1K_TIaJxo8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The British Museum. Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles]''. [[British Museum]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the description of the statue from the 1670s, which said that water flowed from the lion's mouth into a cistern at its feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jarring |first=Gunnar |authorlink= |title=Evliya Celebi och Marmorlejonet från Pireus |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |volume=85 |pages=1–4 |publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]] |year=1978 |url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1970talet/1978_001.pdf |issn=1404-9430 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue, which is made of white [[marble]] and stands some 3&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft.) high, is particularly noteworthy for having been defaced some time in the second half of the 11th century by Scandinavians who carved two lengthy [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions into the shoulders and flanks of the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. D. Kendrick|Kendrick, Thomas D.]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8NgXgRytUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of the Vikings]''. Courier Dover Publications. p. 176. {{ISBN|0-486-43396-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runes are carved in the shape of an elaborate [[lindworm]] dragon-headed [[scroll]], in much the same style as on [[runestone]]s in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=BussLion&gt;"The Book of THoTH (Leaves of Wisdom) — Dragon" (notes), URL: [http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon BT-Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325220622/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon |date=25 March 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvers of the runes were almost certainly [[Varangians]], Scandinavian mercenaries in the service of the [[Byzantine Emperor | Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor]].

== Inscriptions and translations ==
[[File:Pireuslejonet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Piraeus Lion drawing of curved [[lindworm]] inscription (shoulder/flank).]]
[[File:6003 - Venezia - Arsenale - Scritta runica su leone greco (1040) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 3-Aug-2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Photo of inscription on right flank of lion (with contrast exaggerated to make inscription more visible).]]
[[File:Lion runes drawing.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of the same inscription.]]
The inscriptions were not recognised as runes until the Swedish diplomat [[Johan David Åkerblad]] identified them at the end of the 18th century. They are in the shape of a [[lindworm]] (a flightless dragon with serpentine body and two or no legs) and were first translated in the mid-19th century by [[Carl Christian Rafn]], the Secretary of the Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab (Royal Society of Nordic Antiquaries).&lt;ref name="Rafn"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rafn |first=Carl Christian  |authorlink=Carl Christian Rafn |contribution=En Nordisk Runeindskrift i Piræus, med Forklaring af C. C. Rafn |title=Antiquarisk Tidsskrift: Udgivet af det Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab 1855-57 |publisher= |year=1857 |location= |pages=3–69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7khBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are heavily eroded due to weathering and air pollution in [[Venice]], making many of the individual runes barely legible. This has required translators to reconstruct some of the runes, filling in the blanks to determine what words they represented.

There have been several attempts to decipher and translate the text. Below follow Rafn's early attempt (1854) and Eric Brate's attempt (1914), which is considered to be the most successful one.&lt;ref name="Pritsak348"&gt;[[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak, Omeljan]]. (1981). ''The Origin of Rus'.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Distributed by Harvard University Press for the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. p. 348. {{ISBN|0-674-64465-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rafn's translation ==
Rafn's attempt is as follows, with the legible letters shown in bold and the reconstructed ones unbolded:&lt;ref&gt;A. Craig Gibson, "Runic Inscriptions: Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian", in ''Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire'', p. 130.

Some have tried to trace [[Harald Hardrade]]'s name on the inscription, but the time it was carved does not coincide with his time in the service of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Ian (1985).

==Early life and education==
Pal was born in [[Bangladesh]] and received his early schooling in [[Darjeeling]] and [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name=BASC&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Pratapaditya Pal was awarded 'Padmashree'|url=http://home.bascweb.org/drpal|website=bascweb|publisher=Bengali Association of Southern California|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065459/http://home.bascweb.org/drpal|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying at the [[University of Calcutta]], he hoped to specialize in [[anthropology]], but the university didn't offer any courses in the area in 1957, and he instead obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in ancient Indian history and culture.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile"/&gt; He continued at the university to earn a [[PhD]] in the history of [[Nepali architecture]] in 1962. He then won a scholarship to [[Cambridge University]], where in 1965 he earned a second PhD in Nepali sculpture and painting. However he failed to get a teaching job in India, and moved to the US instead.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muchnic|first1=Suzanne|authorlink1=Suzanne Muchnic|title=ART : Laboring Under No Illusions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-20/entertainment/ca-65009_1_southeast-asian-art/|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=20 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1967 Pal was appointed the curator of the Indian art collection at [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum]], a position that had previously been held by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]. In 1969, he moved to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], which was then beginning to develop its own collection of Indian art. Pal joined as the head of department of Indian and Islamic art, and subsequently served as the museum's acting director (1979–80) and as the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art from 1981. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art writer [[Suzanne Muchnic]] described his legacy as building the museum's collection from "a handful of items to about 4,000 pieces, giving LACMA one of the nation's preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art."&lt;ref name="LAT Profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Indian Art Scholar Pratapaditya Pal to speak at Detroit Institute of Arts|url=http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|website=dia.org|publisher=[[Detroit Institute of Arts]]|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=29 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505075255/http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Pal was appointed visiting curator of Indian, Himalayan and Southeast Asian Art at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]. He moved to [[Norton Simon Museum]], [[Pasadena, California]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Artner|first1=Alan G.|title=Himalayas exhibit offers rare glimpse|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-06/news/0304060502_1_himalayan-art-southeast-asian-art-pratapaditya-pal|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=6 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1970s Pal had advised [[Norton Simon]] on acquiring Asian art for that museum.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile" /&gt;

A J Clark was the first to quantify drug-induced biological responses (using an equation described f-mediated receptor activation.

==History==

===The receptor concept===
In 1901, Langley challenged the [[Scientific hypothesis|dominant hypothesis]] that drugs act at nerve endings by demonstrating that nicotine acted at sympathetic ganglia even after the degeneration of the severed preganglionic nerve endings.&lt;ref&gt;Langley J. On the stimulation and paralysis of nerve cells and of nerve-endings. Part 1. ''J Physiol'' 1901 October 16; 27(3): 224–236.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he introduced the concept of a receptive substance on the surface of skeletal muscle that mediated the action of a drug. It also postulated that these receptive substances were different in different species (citing the fact that nicotine-induced muscle paralysis in mammals was absent in crayfish).&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Langley. On the reaction of cells and of nerve-endings to certain poisons, chiefly as regards the reaction of striated muscle to nicotine and to curare. ''J Physiol'' 1905; 33: 374–413.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Paul Ehrlich|Ehrlich]] was trying to understand the basis of selectivity of agents.&lt;ref name=LEL2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Limbird LE |title=The receptor concept: a continuing evolution |journal=Mol. Interv. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=326–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15616162 |doi=10.1124/mi.4.6.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that selectivity was the basis of a preferential distribution of lead and dyes in different body tissues. However, he later modified the theory in order to explain immune reactions and the selectivity of the immune response.&lt;ref name=LEL2004/&gt; Thinking that selectivity was derived from interaction with the tissues themselves, Ehrlich envisaged molecules extending from cells that the body could use to distinguish and mount an immune response to foreign objects. However, it was only when Ahlquist showed the differential action of adrenaline demonstrated its effects on two distinct receptor populations, did the theory of receptor-mediated drug interactions gain acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahlquist | first1 = R.P. | year = 1948 | title = A study of the adrenotrophic receptors | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 586–600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.E.

===Nature of receptor–drug interactions===

====Receptor occupancy model====
The receptor occupancy model, which describes agonist and competitive antagonists, was built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]], and Clark. The occupancy model was the first model put forward by Clark to explain the activity of drugs at receptors and quantified the relationship between drug concentration and observed effect. It is based on mass-action kinetics and attempts to link the action of a drug to the proportion of receptors occupied by that drug at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="CA1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christopoulos A, El-Fakahany EE |title=Qualitative and quantitative assessment of relative agonist efficacy |journal=Biochem. Pharmacol. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=735–48 |year=1999 |pmid=10449182 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.M Ross, and T.P. Kenakin. (2001) Pharmacodynamics. Mechanisms of drug action and the relationship between drug concentration and effect. In Goodman &amp; Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Vol. Tenth. J.G. Hardman &amp; L.E. Limbird, Eds. McGraw-Hill. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the magnitude of the response is directly proportional to the amount of drug bound, and the maximum response would be elicited once all receptors were occupied at equilibrium. He applied mathematical approaches used in enzyme kinetics systematically to the effects of chemicals on tissues.&lt;ref name=TK04/&gt;
He showed that for many drugs, the relationship between drug concentration and biological effect corresponded to a hyperbolic curve, similar to that representing the adsorption of a gas onto a metal surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Quirke V |title=Putting theory into practice: James Black, receptor theory and the development of the beta-blockers at ICI, 1958-1978 |journal=Med Hist |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=69–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16502872 |doi= 10.1017/s0025727300009455|pmc=1369014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitted the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill–Langmuir equation]].&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Clark, together with [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]], was the first to introduce the [[Dose-response relationship#Dose–response curve|log concentration–effect curve]] and described the now-familiar 'parallel shift' of the log concentration–effect curve produced by a competitive antagonist.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Attempts to separate the binding phenomenon and activation phenomenon were made by [[Everhardus Jacobus Ariëns|Ariëns]] in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="CA1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF |title=The emergence of the drug receptor theory |journal=Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=637–41 |year=2002 |pmid=12402503 |doi=10.1038/nrd875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic occupational models of receptor activation failed to provide evidence to directly support the idea that receptor occupancy follows a Langmuir curve as the model assumed leading to the development of alternative models to explain drug behaviour.&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;

=====Competitive inhibition models=====

The development of the classic theory of drug antagonism by Gaddum, Schild and Arunlakshana built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]] and Clark.&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"&gt;D. Colquhoun, The relation between classical and cooperative models for drug action. In: H.P. Rang, Editor, Drug Receptors, Macmillan Press (1973), pp. 149–182. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/colquhoun-1973.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]] described a model for the competitive binding of two ligands to the same receptor in short communication to the Physiological Society in 1937. The description referred only to binding, it was not immediately useful for the analysis of experimental measurements of the effects of antagonists on the response to agonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colquhoun D |title=The quantitative analysis of drug-receptor interactions: a short history |journal=Trends Pharmacol. Sci. |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=149–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16483674 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2006.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Heinz Otto Schild who made measurement of the equilibrium constant for the binding of an antagonist possible.  He developed the [[Schild regression|Schild equation]] to determine a dose ratio, a measure of the potency of a drug. In Schild regression, the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of an agonist alone compared to the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve used to determine the affinity of an antagonist for its receptor.

=====Agonist models=====

The flaw in Clark's receptor-occupancy model was that it was insufficient to explain the concept of [[agonist|partial agonist]] lead to the development of agonist models of drug action by Ariens in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"/&gt;

===Two-state receptor theory===

The two-state model is a simple linear model to describe the interaction between a ligand and its receptor, but also the active receptor (R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridges TM, Lindsley CW |title=G-Protein-Coupled Receptors: From Classical Modes of Modulation to Allosteric Mechanisms |journal=ACS Chem. Biol. |volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 530–41|date=July 2008 |pmid=18652471 |doi=10.1021/cb800116f |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model uses an equilibrium dissociation constant to describe the interaction between ligand and receptor.  It proposes that ligand binding results in a change in receptor state from an inactive to an active state based on the [[Protein structure|receptor's conformation]]. A receptor in its active state will ultimately elicit its biological response. It was first described by Black and Leff in 1983 as an alternative model of receptor activation.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Black and P. Leff. (1983) Operational Models of Pharmacological Agonism. In: ''Proc. R. Soc. London Ser.''

===Ternary complex model===
The original Ternary complex model was used to describe ligand, receptor, and G-protein interactions.  It uses equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions between the receptor and each ligand (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand A; K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand B), as well as a cooperativity factor (α) that denotes the mutual effect of the two ligands on each other’s affinity for the receptor. An α &gt; 1.0 refers to positive allosteric modulation, an α &lt; 1.0 refers to negative allosteric modulation, and an α = 1.0 means that binding of either ligand to the receptor does not alter the affinity of the other ligand for the receptor (i.e., a neutral modulator).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt; Further, the α parameter can be added as a subtle but highly useful extension to the ATCM in order to include effects of an allosteric modulator on the efficacy (as distinct from the affinity) of another ligand that binds the receptor, such as the orthosteric agonist. Some ligands can reduce the efficacy but increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist for the receptor.&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt;

Although it is a simple assumption that the proportional amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better measure for response than is the fractional or proportional change. This is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/ antagonist combinations on the desensitization of receptors. This is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated by overexpression, since this requires a change between R and R* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional rather than a net change, and for the molecular model that fits with the mathematical model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/ijp.pdf Optimal Agonist/Antagonist Combinations Maintain Receptor Response by Preventing Rapid β-adrenergic Receptor Desensitization | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for b2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/Graphics.htm The Biophysical Basis for the Graphical Representations | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulates of receptor theory==
*[[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] must possess structural and steric specificity.
*Receptors are [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturable]] and finite (limited number of binding sites)
*Receptors must possess high [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]] for its endogenous ligand at physiological concentrations
*Once the endogenous ligand binds to the receptor, some early recognizable chemical event must occur

'''Redemptive-historical preaching''' is a method of [[preaching]] that emerged from the [[Reformed churches]] of the Netherlands in the early 1940s. The debate concerned itself with the question: "How are we to preach the historical narratives of the [[Christian Bible|Bible]]?"

On one side of the question were the proponents of "exemplaristic" preaching. This method of preaching taught that the biblical narratives in general, and the [[Old Testament]] stories in particular, were to be preached as examples of how [[Christians]] today should (or should not) live their lives. Old Testament believers were held up as examples (or anti-examples, as the case may be, see for example [[Anti-Judaism]]) of how we should conduct ourselves.

On the other side of the debate were the advocates of preaching that was "redemptive-historical" (the term used to translate the Dutch ''heilshistorisch''). They argued that Old Testament narratives are not primarily to be moral examples, but as revelations of the coming [[Messiah]]. The narratives of the Old Testament served as [[Typology (theology)|types]] and shadows pointing forward in history to the time when [[Jewish messianism|Israel’s messiah]] would be revealed in the person and work of [[Jesus]]. In support of this view, the advocates of redemptive-historical preaching drew heavily upon the text of {{bibleverse||Luke|24:27}}, where Jesus is teaching the disciples on the road to Emmaus: "And beginning with [[Moses]] and all the [[Prophet]]s, he interpreted to them in all the [[Scriptures]] the things concerning himself" (English Standard Version). Further support was taken from verse 44 of the same chapter, where Jesus says, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the [[Law of Moses]] and the [[Neviim|Prophets]] and the [[Psalms]] must be fulfilled."

==Explanation==
The Bible was seen, not as a collection of abstract moral principles, but rather as an anthology of the events of God’s great works in history. The Bible was seen as the unfolding story of the coming [[Christ]], progressively revealing more and more about him throughout salvation history. This, then, is to be the way in which the narratives are to be preached: with a view towards showing how the text points towards Christ.

The [[Biblical theology|Biblical-Theological]] movement originated in Germany under the liberal teaching and writing of [[Johann Philipp Gabler]], who emphasized the historical nature of the Bible over against an overly [[dogma]]tic reading of it.

Nearly a century later, [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] inaugurated its first professor of Biblical Theology, [[Geerhardus Vos]]. Vos was instrumental in taking the discipline of biblical theology in a more conservative direction, using it to vindicate the [[Reformed]] faith and historic Christianity over against [[Liberal Christianity|theological liberalism]].

Today, at least in North America, the redemptive-Jesus reins of preaching has been carried forward through the work of [[Northwest Theological Seminary]], [[Westminster Theological Seminary]], [[Westminster Seminary California]], [[Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] Calvin Theological Seminary 
and [[Canadian Reformed Theological Seminary]].

==Counterpoint==
Opponents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erikwait.com/index.cgi?location=2&amp;action=display_one&amp;story_id=280 Erik Wait]&lt;/ref&gt; of redemptive historical preaching often fault this type of preaching as being weak when it comes to practical application of the Bible. They believe moral examples given in Scripture are undermined or diminished, and that redemptive-historical preaching can fail to challenge the listener to conduct consistent with Scriptural direction given in places such as [[Sermon on the Mount|Matthew 5-7]], and Romans and other [[Pauline Epistles]].

Advocates of redemptive-historical preaching do believe application is necessary. However, the main controversy surrounding this preaching method is the question whether or not using the characters of the Bible as moral exemplars for the believers today diminishes Christ as the center of the text.

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8154">{{sociology}}
'''Sociomusicology''' (from [[Latin]]: ''socius'', "companion"; from [[Old French]] ''musique''; and the suffix ''-ology'', "the study of", from Old Greek λόγος, ''lógos'' : "discourse"), also called '''music sociology''' or the '''sociology of music''', refers to both an academic [[Subfields of sociology|subfield]] of [[sociology]] that is concerned with [[music]] (often in combination with other arts), as well as a subfield of [[musicology]] that focuses on social aspects of musical behavior and the role of music in [[society]].

==Sociomusicological issues==
The work of scholars in sociomusicology is often similar to [[ethnomusicology]] in terms of its exploration of the sociocultural context of music; however, sociomusicology maintains less of an emphasis on ethnic and national identity, and is not limited to ethnographic methods. Rather, sociomusicologists use a wide range of [[research methods]] and take a strong interest in observable behavior and musical interactions within the constraints of [[social structure]]. Sociomusicologists are more likely than ethnomusicologists to make use of surveys and economic data, for example, and tend to focus on musical practices in contemporary industrialized societies. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology (cf. Ko, C. K. S. (2011). An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. This book {{ISBN|9789881580214}} has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174.)

Since the field of musicology has tended to emphasize [[historiographic]] and analytical/critical rather than sociological approaches to [[research]], sociomusicology is still regarded as somewhat outside the mainstream of musicology. Yet, with the increased popularity of [[ethnomusicology]] in recent decades (with which the field shares many similarities), as well as the development and mainstreaming of "[[New Musicology]]" (coinciding with the emergence of interdisciplinary [[Cultural Studies]] in academia), sociomusicology is increasingly coming into its own as a fully established field.The values and meanings associated with music are collectively constructed by both music listeners and performers. When listening to a piece, they reflect upon their own values and use the music to make connections between their own experiences and what the piece is perceived as communicating. The sociology of music looks specifically at these connections and the musical experiences tied to the person and the music itself.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine ELLIS, An Introduction to Music Studies, Chapter 3: ‘The Sociology of Music’. Pg. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most notable classical sociologists to examine the social aspects and effects of music were [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), [[Alfred Schutz]] (1899–1959), [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) and [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969). Others have included [[Alphons Silbermann]], [[Charles Seeger]] (1886–1979), [[Howard Saul Becker]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Jacques Attali]], John Mueller (1895–1965), and [[Christopher Small]]. Contemporary sociomusicologists include [[Tia DeNora]], Georgina Born, [[David G. Hebert|David Hebert]], Peter Martin, Timothy Dowd and Joseph Schloss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">The '''Southern California Coastal Water Research Project''' (SCCWRP) is a research institute focusing on the coastal ecosystems of [[Southern California]] from [[drainage basin|watersheds]] to the ocean. SCCWRP was created as a [[joint powers authority]] (JPA), which is an agency formed when multiple government agencies have a common mission that can be better achieved by pooling resources and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress, [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (1987).

''Managing Troubled Waters: The Role of Marine Environmental Monitoring.'' Washington, DC: National Academy Press. p. 22. {{ISBN|0-309-04194-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
SCCWRP is located in [[Costa Mesa, California]].  SCCWRP's original location (in 1969) was Westwood, California, with subsequent offices in El Segundo, Long Beach and Westminster before moving to the present location in 2007.

==Research==
SCCWRP’s research foci include collaborative regional environmental monitoring, development of assessment tools to characterize environmental conditions, and modeling and analysis to answer relevant environmental management questions. Significant research topics include regional monitoring of the [[Southern California Bight]], beach [[water quality]], [[hydromodification]], [[wetlands]], [[eutrophication]], [[marine debris]], and [[contaminants]] of emerging concern.&lt;ref&gt;Panel on Southern California Bight of the Committee on a Systems Assessment of Marine Environmental Monitoring (1990).

''Waste disposal in the oceans: minimizing impact, maximizing benefits.'' Boulder, CO: [[Westview Press]]. {{ISBN|0-86531-966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also works to transition new technologies to the user community, and foster communication among different stakeholder sectors, including regulatory agencies, [[wastewater]] dischargers, [[stormwater]] managers, academic researchers, [[nonprofit]] groups, technology developers, and industries affected by aquatic and marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/clean-beach-measuring-to-improve|title=Eye on the Environment: Clean beach measuring to improve|first=Bram |last=Sercu|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|date= July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SCCWRP was formed in 1969, at about the time when California’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was passed, to prepare an integrative report about the effects of wastewater and other discharges on the Southern California coastal marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Mearns|first1=Alan J |first2=M James |last2=Allen|first3=Michael D |last3=Moore|year=2001|title=The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project - 30 years of environmental research in the Southern California Bight|url=ftp://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/AnnualReports/1999AnnualReport/01_ar01.pdf|format=PDF|pages=2-26 |editor1=S.B.

Elmore|series=Southern California Coastal Water Research Project 1999-2000 Annual Report|publisher=Southern California Coastal Water Research Project|accessdate=May 5, 2014|location=Westminster, CA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally intended as a three-year project, SCCWRP was reauthorized to conduct further research in 1972 owing to the many data gaps identified in the summary report.&lt;ref&gt;Wick, Gerald (July 1973). “California’s Outfalls.” ''[[New Scientist]]'' '''59'''(854): 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; The JPA has since been amended several times, extending SCCWRP’s existence through to the present day.

==Member Agencies==
SCCWRP's original member agencies in 1969 included the five largest southern California metropolitan sanitation agencies ([[City of San Diego]], [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]] Sanitation District, [[Orange County Sanitation District]], and [[Ventura County]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kennish, Michael J (1998). ''Pollution Impacts on Marine Biotic Communities.'' Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]. p. 151-152. {{ISBN|0-8493-8428-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, additional member agencies were added to the JPA. 

These include water quality regulatory agencies added in 1990 ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Region IX; [[California State Water Resources Control Board]]; Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board; Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board; and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board) and the largest southern California stormwater management agencies added in 2003 (Ventura County Watershed Protection District, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, Orange County Public Works, and [[County of San Diego]]). The most recent addition was the California Ocean Protection Council, which was added in 2007 to enhance interactions with the [[California Resources Agency]].

The '''storage of cultural heritage objects''' typically falls to the responsibility of cultural heritage institutions, or individuals. The proper storage of these objects can help to ensure a longer lifespan for the object with minimal damage or degradation. With so many different types of artifacts, materials, and combinations of materials, keepers of these artifacts often have considerable knowledge of the best practices in storing these objects to preserve their original state.

== Storage spaces ==
[[File:Shelves of military equipment at the Treloar Technology Centre in September 2012.JPG|thumb|Items being stored on shelves and the floor at the Australian War Memorial's [[Treloar Resource Centre]]]]
The process involved when creating a collections storage area usually involves determining the available resources, the needs of the specific collection, how the collection will be used, and the necessary space required based on the current collection and potential future acquisitions.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000423/042316eo.pdf |title=Protection of the cultural heritage: Museum collection storage |last1=Johnson |first1=E.Verner |last2=Horgan |first2=Joanne C. |publisher=United Nations, Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organizations |date=1979 |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of objects in storage, as well as the need to retrieve them, will have an effect on the type of storage space desired. If only a small portion of the collection is regularly utilized, then a separate more easily accessible storage space may be chosen for these objects, while less utilized objects may be held in a less accessible area of the building, or an offsite facility.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;  In either case, collections storage spaces are typically separate from all other activity in order to decrease the potential for damage to the collection from theft, tracked in soil, excessive light exposure, etc.&lt;ref name=NPS2012&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 7: Museum Collection Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well designed collections storage space is multi-layered, beginning with the building itself, a room, storage furniture, and packaging.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; The more layers utilized the greater the protection from agents of deterioration.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; It is generally agreed that storage spaces should not be at the top of the building or below grade, but attics and basements are often the most practical space for storage, so many institutions weigh the risks, and opt to upgrade these spaces in terms of structure, insulation, and/or vapor barriers to create a suitable space for storage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Lynn |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=293–299 |chapter=5H: Storage |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and size of the objects in the collection also help to determine where and how the storage space is set up. If the collection has many large heavy items, like furniture, the storage spaces typically have low shelving for these items, and require wide isles to move the objects, especially if they require large equipment like a forklift to be moved.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In these cases, the doorways must be large enough to accommodate these large objects, and the floor structure must be reinforced to hold the weight of the collection.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; If a collection consists of mostly small objects, then cabinets and shelving are a practical solution, while a collection of two-dimensional works might require flat drawers and hanging racks.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Environmental control ==
The climate control systems in collections storage typically include the control of temperature, [[relative humidity]], and a ventilation and filtration system to remove atmospheric pollutants like dust, chemicals, and micro-organisms.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; The basic idea of climate control is to keep the temperature and relative humidity at a steady rate so as to avoid expansion and contraction of materials, which can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=MPH5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-5.pdf |title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 5: Agents of Deterioration|publisher=Department of the Interior |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate control is typically achieved by utilizing an [[HVAC]] system, though depending on weather patterns, these systems can often require a great deal of energy to run, which is a concern for many institutions.&lt;ref name=WAAC&gt;{{cite web|title=A Discussion of Research on the Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity on Museum Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-3/wn18-307.html|website=WAAC Newsletter|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Generally, keeping a lower temperature is better for collections storage, because chemical and biological reactions tend to increase as the temperature increases and structural damage is possible to objects made of materials such as wax, at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The standard practice for temperature control for general collections objects is a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°F +/-2&amp;nbsp;°F, or 21&amp;nbsp;°C +/-2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Genevieve |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=287–292 |chapter=5G: Preventive Care |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some collections, there are specified temperature suggestions to protect delicate materials. For example, furs, paper archives, and textiles may be stored at a lower temperature between 41&amp;nbsp;°F to 50&amp;nbsp;°F (5-10&amp;nbsp;°C), and cellulose nitrate film is often isolated and stored below freezing, as it has the potential to ignite at 106&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

===Relative humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumb|Hygrothermograph]]
The standard practice for humidity control for collections objects is a relative humidity of 50% +/-5%, though the expenditures required to keep such a tight relative humidity have been shown to only offer modest prevention benefits.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; As with temperature control, the main goal of the control of relative humidity to is avoid major fluctuations which can cause physical damage to objects, with long term seasonal changes causing greater damage than short term changes.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; [[Hygroscopy|Hygroscopic]] materials such as wood, textiles, and bone, are especially sensitive to changes in humidity, as they swell and shrink according to the environment, which will cause deterioration over time.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Mold growth occurs only when the relative humidity is about 70% or higher, and insect infestation is more common with a high relative humidity.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; A very low relative humidity, of about 35% or lower, can cause embrittlement of paper and adhesives, as well as cracking and warping of wood and ivory.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Many museum objects are constructed of multiple materials, so in order to provide an appropriate relative humidity for the object as a whole, certain materials may be compromised.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

=== Monitoring Climate ===
An ongoing monitoring system is essential to the preventive care of objects in collections storage, as it helps to identify any problems, evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures, and document the effect of extraordinary events such as water leaks, long periods of drought, or heavy rains.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Hygrothermographs are a tool that constantly monitors both the temperature and relative humidity, and are fairly reliable if properly calibrated, a task that must be completed at least every three months if not more frequently.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The value with these devices is that they constantly record the data onto graphs that can be analyzed at a later time. [[Hygrometer]]s, thermometers, and thermohygrometers are also useful for determining the temperature and relative humidity of a space, but the most reliable tool is a psychrometer.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; [[Data logger]]s are becoming more popular in institutions as they are small, record data at desired intervals, and allow the data to be easily transferred to a computer in multiple formats including graphs and tables, which allows for easy collection and assessment of the data.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt;

== Lighting ==
Because damage from visible light and ultraviolet radiation is cumulative and irreversible, collections storage spaces tend to have few ambient light sources, such as windows, and often have lighting installed in multiple zones controlled by different switches, so that all of the lights do not have to be turned on when only a small area of the storage space is actively being used.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; LED or UV-filtered fluorescent bulbs are generally recommended, as they save energy compared to incandescent bulbs, while quartz and halogen bulbs emit high levels of UV and infrared radiation as well as a significant amount of heat, which can cause increased deterioration of objects in the space.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Integrated pest management ==
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated pest management (IPM)]] is an intensive program that monitors for pests, such as insects and rodents, which may harm collections. This method utilizes traps to monitor the types of pests entering storage spaces, and to eliminate pest entrances and attractors.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Chemical treatments for pests are generally only utilized as a last resort, and with the advice of a professional, because they add toxic and potentially harmful chemicals to the storage space.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; To avoid attracting pests, collecting institutions typically avoid having exterior lighting focused around doors and windows, when possible, and also avoid using mercury vapor or tungsten lights.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

== Storage furniture ==
[[File:MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966.jpg|thumb|MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966]]
They type of objects in the collection, available space, and need for ease of accessibility tend to determine what type of storage system is utilized for a particular collection.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; There are many generic storage systems that can be purchased and modified to fit the needs of a specific collection, and this is generally more cost effective than having a system specially built.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In small storage areas many institutions will utilize mobile systems that have shelving units on a track, which allows access to a desired aisle while the rest of the shelving units are pushed together.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

Wood storage furniture is typically avoided, even if painted, as it offgasses harmful acids, while often used metal storage equipment is typically made out of steel that is powder-coated with an epoxy finish, which is more durable than an acrylic or polyester finish.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Storage racks ===
Sliding racks are typically used for the storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a wire rack connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized to make the most of the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Shelving and cabinets ===
[[File:Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10.jpg|thumb|Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10]]
Open steel shelving systems are cost effective, and easily adjusted to accommodate objects of various sizes.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Deeper shelves are often utilized for larger objects, while smaller objects are typically stored on narrower shelves to avoid overcrowding, and potential damage when retrieving objects from the back of the shelf.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Shelving units can accommodate the height of the ceiling if necessary, but it is safer for objects and those working with them to keep shelves within an easily accessible reach.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; If open shelving is used, it is suggested that the objects are placed in boxes, or otherwise covered to protect the objects from dust and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Metal shelving is prone to carry vibrations, so if objects are not individually housed in boxes or otherwise stabilized, it is recommended that the shelves be lined with a protective padding.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; It is also necessary for cabinets to be stabilized by being bolted to the floor or walls, and for shelves to have restraining bars, to avoid tipping, especially in earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

Cabinets tend to be versatile and easily accommodate a wide variety of objects with adjustable shelving and drawers, and have the ability to close the objects off to avoid damage from dust and light even if the objects are not in boxes or otherwise covered.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Drawers ===
Drawers can be open or closed, and contained within cabinets or stand as a unit of their own. Open drawer systems leave room between drawers and are often adjustable to accommodate objects of different heights by placing the drawers in the desired runners or leaving unused drawers out completely.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Closed drawer systems offer more protection from dust and light exposure than the open drawer systems, and the drawers are typically shorter to accommodate small objects, textiles, and two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Dividers can be made to fit in shallow drawers to create individual compartments for small objects like coins, or small individual boxes can be utilized in the same fashion, which allows the entire box to be removed so the object itself is handled less.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;
[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 2.JPG|thumb|An archival tube role for a Chinese scroll.]]

=== Textile rolls ===
Rolls are a preferred way to store certain textiles because they help to avoid creasing or stretching. The method typically involves rolling textiles around a cardboard tube that has been covered with acid-free paper, or some other barrier, and then a plastic cover is wrapped around the rolled textile, with the ends loosely tied, to protect from dust.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Rolled textiles can be placed on a shelf, but a preferred method is to suspend them horizontally by the ends of the tubes, which keeps the textiles from being damaged by pressure.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

== Archival housing materials ==
Archival housing materials are utilized to protect objects from dust, light, and vibrations that could potentially harm objects in the storage space, if they were not otherwise protected.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Commonly used office supplies do not typically have archival qualities, and to ensure that collections objects are not affected by these materials, institutions do not use materials that have not been tested, to ensure they are inert and therefore will not place the collections at risk.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival boxes ===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumb|Archival boxes on open shelves.]]
Boxes can add an additional layer of microclimate insulation and make moving objects easier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival boxes are typically made of corrugated, acid-free paper, either buffered or unbuffered, or they can be made of corrugated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Archival papers ===
All paper products will acidify over time, so even archival [[acid-free paper]] products used for storage are typically replaced every few years.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival acid-free paper products can be either buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered paper has a neutral pH and is used for housing photographs, textiles, and most other types of objects, while buffered paper, which is impregnated with calcium carbonate and has an alkaline pH, is used for storing paper objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; The buffered paper absorbs the acid that paper objects emit and keeps the micro-environment from becoming overly acidic for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Acid-free [[Glassine|glassine paper]] is typically used to cover [[friability|friable]] materials or objects with oily/tacky surfaces, as it is smooth and does not create static electricity, though it is only used for short periods of time because it deteriorates quickly.&lt;ref name=NPS1999&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=1999 |chapter=Chapter 6: Handling, Packing, and Shipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Soft unbuffered acid-free tissue paper is used for covering a variety of objects, creating padding in boxes, and for placing in the folds of textiles to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Acid-free folders are valuable for storing unframed prints and documents in flat files.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;

=== Archival plastics ===
Most common plastics contain chlorinated compounds and plasticizers, which can migrate out and harm objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Polyethylene and polyester are considered archival plastics because they do not offgas harmful chemicals, but they can produce static electricity in a low RH, so they should be avoided around friable objects.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

*Polyester film, or [[BoPET|Mylar]], is a good tool for paper preservation and can act as a vapor barrier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*[[Tyvek]] is a textile-like material created from high-density polyethylene, and works as an alternative to glassine paper, but its fabric-like quality also allows it to be draped over objects and utilized in numerous ways where paper products are not ideal.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polypropylene or polyethylene bags come in a multitude of sizes, with or without zip closures, and are often utilized for small objects, but may trap moisture and cause molding if sealed closed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;&lt;ref name=MPH8&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-8.pdf|title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 8: Handling, Packing, and Shipping |publisher=Department of the Interior|format=PDF|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archival fabrics ===
Fabrics are utilized for wrapping or padding objects, or in the form of string to secure wrappings or labels onto objects. Archival fabrics are typically washed before use to remove sizing chemicals and to soften the material, and are never dyed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Cotton fabrics are often used, typically in the form of twill tape and  threads, which allow for an easy way to secure wrappings, secure objects within containers, and to tie tags to objects with registration information.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*Unbleached muslin is often used to wrap sculptures and textiles.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polyester batting is often utilized for padding objects, especially textiles, which often require padding between folds to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival foams ===
Foam rubber and urethane foams offgas harmful fumes, and are highly flammable, so they are typically avoided in collection storage spaces.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Polyethylene microfoam, commonly called Ethafoam, is an inert foam that is useful for lining drawers and shelves, padding or cradling objects, or for mounting objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; It is commercially available in numerous sizes and can easily be cut and shaped to fit the users needs.

== Open Storage ==
[[File:Visual storage at V&amp;A - 1 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|250px|Visual storage at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]]]
Many museums are beginning to opt for [[Visible storage|open storage]] spaces that allow visitors to see more of the collections and behind the scenes activities. While this practice has become popular for the enjoyment of visitors and the transparency of institutions, the practice allows for increased light exposure, dust levels, and other environmental concerns that could be potentially harmful to the objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

{{Indian name|Ramachandran|Subramanian}}

'''Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran''' (born 10 August 1951) is a [[neuroscientist]] known primarily for his work in the fields of [[behavioral neurology]] and visual [[psychophysics]]. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Neurosciences at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Ramachandran is the author of several books that have garnered widespread public interest. These include ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'' (1998), "A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness" (2004) and ''The Tell-Tale Brain'' (2010).

Ramachandran has achieved both professional and popular recognition. He has published papers on a wide variety of topics in neuroscience. His  books, interviews, and lectures have helped build public interest in contemporary neuroscience. In 2011, [[Time Magazine|''Time'']] listed him as one of "the most influential people in the world" on the "Time 100 list".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066125,00.html|title=The 2011 TIME 100 - TIME|last=Insel|first=Thomas|date=2011-04-21|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Ramachandran (in accordance with some [[Surnames by country#India|Tamil family name]] traditions, the town of his family's origin, Vilayanur, is placed first) was born in 1951 in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Anthony |title=VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2014 |publisher=guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/brain-games|title=Brain Games|first=John|last=Colapinto|date=4 May 2009|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, V. M.

He then spent two years at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as a research fellow working with [[Jack Pettigrew]].  He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1983, and has been a full professor there since 1998.

==Scientific career==

Ramachandran's early research was on human visual perception using psychophysical methods to draw clear inferences about the brain mechanisms underlying visual processing. In the early 1990s Ramachandran began to focus on neurological syndromes such as [[phantom limb]]s, [[body integrity identity disorder]] and the [[Capgras delusion]]. He has also contributed to the understanding of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref name="Colapinto" /&gt; and is known for inventing the [[mirror box]]. 

Ramachandran is noted for his use of experimental methods that make relatively little use of complex technologies such as [[neuroimaging]]. Despite the apparent simplicity of his approach, he has generated many new ideas about the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience], [[The Observer]], 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has encountered skepticism about some of his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter, Book Review, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has responded that "I have—for better or worse—roamed the whole landscape of visual perception, stereopsis, phantom limbs, denial of paralysis, Capgras syndrome, synaesthesia, and many others."&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran,V.S. Author Response, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his academic research Ramachanran has served as a consultant in areas such as forensic psychology and the neuroscience of weight reduction. In 2007, Ramachandran served as an [[expert witness]] on [[pseudocyesis]] (false pregnancy) at the trial of [[Lisa M. Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;AP,NBC website,Crime and Courts,10/17/2007[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21351116/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/doctor-cites-mental-illness-fetus-theft-suspect/#.W7EuSWhKi01]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran is currently serving as a consultant to a company (Modius) that is developing weight reduction technology that relies on electrically stimulating parts of the brain that control weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach,Brad,Modius Intends To Buck The Trend Of Weight Loss Solutions With Data-Based Success And FDA Approval,Forbes,Mar 16, 2018,[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradauerbach/2018/03/16/modius-intends-to-buck-the-trend-of-weight-loss-solutions-with-data-based-success-and-fda-approval/#b1a1ccc70bd4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran is the director of a research group at the University of California, San Diego, known as the Center for Brain and Cognition.&lt;ref name="cbc.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/research.html|title=The Center for Brain and Cognition - Research|website=cbc.ucsd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,912832862001_2066607,00.html|title=V.S.

===Theories and research===

====Phantom limbs====
{{main|Phantom limb}}
When an arm or leg is amputated, patients often continue to feel vividly the presence of the missing limb as a "phantom limb" (an average of 80%). Building on earlier work by [[Ronald Melzack]] (McGill University) and Timothy Pons (NIMH), Ramachandran theorized that there was a link between the phenomenon of phantom limbs and [[neural plasticity]] in the adult [[human brain]]. In 1993, working with T.T. Yang who was conducting [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]] research at the Scripps Research Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html Yang, UCSD Faculty web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122737/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html |date=31 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran demonstrated that there had been measurable changes in the somatosensory cortex of a patient who had undergone an arm amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199402000-00010 |pmid=8199341 |title=Noninvasive detection of cerebral plasticity in adult human somatosensory cortex |journal=NeuroReport |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=701–4 |year=1994 |last1=Yang |first1=T.

====Mirror visual feedback / Mirror Therapy====
{{main|Mirror box}}
[[File:Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and psychology student Matthew Marradi holding the original Mirror Box.jpg|thumb|Ramachandran standing next to the original [[mirror box]]]]
Ramachandran is credited with the invention of the mirror box and the introduction of mirror visual feedback (mirror therapy) as a treatment for phantom limb paralysis. Ramachandran found that in some cases restoring movement to a paralyzed phantom limb reduced pain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0058 |pmid=8637922 |title=Synaesthesia in Phantom Limbs Induced with Mirrors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=263 |issue=1369 |pages=377–86 |year=1996 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=V. S |last2=Rogers-Ramachandran |first2=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic reviews of the research literature on mirror therapy (MT) have arrived at conflicting conclusions about the effectiveness of MT. A 2014 review found that MT can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control.&lt;ref&gt;Deconinck,Smorenburg,Benham,Ledebt,Feltham,Savelsbergh,Reflections on mirror therapy: a systematic review of the effect of mirror visual feedback on the brain,Neurorehabil Neural Repair,2015,May29(4),349-61[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25160567]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2016 review concluded that the level of evidence is insufficient to recommend MT as a first intention treatment for phantom limb pain.&lt;ref&gt;Barbin,Seethaa,Casillasc,Paysantd,Pérennou,Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,Volume 59, Issue 4, September 2016,Pages270-275&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Neural cross-wiring: synesthesia====
[[File:synaesthesiatest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Synesthetes who experience color when viewing different symbols may quickly identify the presence of the "triangle" in the left-hand image.]]
{{main|Synesthesia}}
Ramachandran was one of the first scientists to theorize that grapheme-color synesthesia arises from a cross-activation between brain regions.&lt;ref name="ramachandran2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramachandran VS, Hubbard EM|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=3–34 |year=2001 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15797557"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.008 |pmid=15797557 |title=Individual Differences among Grapheme-Color Synesthetes: Brain-Behavior Correlations |journal=Neuron |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=975–85 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Arman |first2=A. Cyrus |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S |last4=Boynton |first4=Geoffrey M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran and his graduate student, Ed Hubbard, conducted research with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] that found increased activity in [[Visual cortex#V4|the color recognition areas of the brain]] in synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes.&lt;ref name="pmid15797557" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16269367"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.012 |pmid=16269367 |title=Neurocognitive Mechanisms of Synesthesia |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=509–20 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Ramachandran |first2=V.S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ramachandran has speculated that conceptual metaphors may have a neurological basis in cortical cross-activation, as well. However,the neurological basis of synesthesia is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;Hupel,Jean-Michel,Dojat,Michel,A critical review of the neuroimaging literature on synesthesia,Frontiers In Human Neuroscience,2015,9,103,Published online 2015 Mar 3 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379872/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mirror neurons====

Ramachandran's theories about the role of mirror neurons have attracted a great deal of discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett,Christian, A Calm Look At The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience -- Mirror Neurons,Wired,Science, 12,13,2013[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Costandi,Mo,Reflecting on mirror neurons,Neurophilosophy,The Guardian,23 August 2013[https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/aug/23/mirror-neurons]&lt;/ref&gt; (Mirror neurons were first reported in a paper published in 1992 by a team of researchers led by [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] at the [[University of Parma]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-2002-3 |pmid=19760408 |title=Mirror neurons: From discovery to autism |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=200 |issue=3–4 |pages=223–37 |year=2009 |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=Giacomo |last2=Fabbri-Destro |first2=Maddalena }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has speculated that research into the role of mirror neurons will help explain a variety of human mental capacities such as empathy, imitation learning, and the evolution of language. In 2000, Ramachandran made a prediction that "mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments."&lt;ref name=Jarrett2012PT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience |title=Mirror Neurons: The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience? |first=Christian |last=Jarrett |work=Psychology Today |date=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, Making Sense of the Brain's Mysteries, American Scientist, On-line Book Review, July–August, 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014003257/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/making-sense-of-the-brains-mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the past ten years, many of the exciting theories about mirror neurons have not held up under scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor,John,Mirror Neurons After a Quarter Century: New light, new cracks,Science In The News (web article)Harvard University,Aug 29,2016[http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/mirror-neurons-quarter-century-new-light-new-cracks/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===="Broken Mirrors" theory of autism====
{{main|Autism#Pathophysiology|l1=Autism: Pathophysiology}}
In 1999, Ramachandran, in collaboration with then post-doctoral fellow Eric Altschuler and colleague Jaime Pineda, hypothesized that a loss of [[mirror neurons]] might be the key deficit that explains many of the symptoms and signs of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=E.L. Altschuler, A. Vankov, E.M. Hubbard, E. Roberts, V.S. Ramachandran and J.A. Pineda |year=2000 |title=Mu wave blocking by observer of movement and its possible use as a tool to study theory of other minds |booktitle=30th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience |publisher=Society for Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2006 Ramachandran and his colleagues at UC San Diego published a number of articles in support of this theory, which became known as the "Broken Mirrors" theory of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2005.01.014 |pmid=15993757 |title=EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=190–8 |year=2005 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=Hubbard |first2=Edward M |last3=McCleery |first3=Joseph P |last4=Altschuler |first4=Eric L |last5=Ramachandran |first5=Vilayanur S |last6=Pineda |first6=Jaime A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1106-62 |pmid=17076085 |title=Broken Mirrors: A Theory of Autism |journal=Scientific American |volume=295 |issue=5 |pages=62–9 |year=2006 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=Vilayanur S |last2=Oberman |first2=Lindsay M |bibcode=2006SciAm.295e..62R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.310 |pmid=17338602 |title=The simulating social mind: The role of the mirror neuron system and simulation in the social and communicative deficits of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=310–27 |year=2007 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=Ramachandran |first2=Vilayanur S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran and his colleagues did not measure mirror neuron activity directly; rather they demonstrated that children with ASD showed abnormal EEG responses (known as [[Mu wave]] suppression) when they observed the activities of other people. Ramachandran's "broken mirrors hypothesis" explanation for autism remains controversial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Jarrett,A Calm Look at the Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience - Mirror Neurons,Wired,13 December 2013,[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fan,Y.T.;Decety,J.;Yang,C.Y.;Liu,J.L.; Cheng,Y, "Unbroken mirror neurons in autism spectrum disorders",Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,26 May 2010 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02269.x/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Xenomelia (Apotemnophilia)====
{{main|Body Identity Integrity Disorder}}
In 2008, Ramachandran, along with David Brang and Paul McGeoch, published the first paper to theorize that [[apotemnophilia]] is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the right [[parietal lobe]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="brang2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e32830abc4d |pmid=18695512 |title=Apotemnophilia: A neurological disorder |journal=NeuroReport |volume=19 |issue=13 |pages=1305–6 |year=2008 |last1=Brang |first1=David |last2=McGeoch |first2=Paul D |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rare disorder, in which a person desires the amputation of a limb, was first identified by [[John Money]] in 1977. Building on medical case studies that linked brain damage to syndromes such as [[somatoparaphrenia]] (lack of limb ownership) the authors speculated that the desire for amputation could be related to changes in the right parietal lobe. In 2011 McGeoch, Brang and Ramachandran reported a functional imaging experiment involving four subjects who desired lower limb amputations. MEG scans demonstrated that their right superior parietal lobules were significantly less active in response to tactile stimulation of a limb that the subjects wished to have amputated, as compared to age/sex matched controls. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp-2011-300224 |pmid=21693632 |title=Xenomelia: A new right parietal lobe syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=1314–9 |year=2011 |last1=McGeoch |first1=P. D |last2=Brang |first2=D |last3=Song |first3=T |last4=Lee |first4=R. R |last5=Huang |first5=M |last6=Ramachandran |first6=V. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduced the word "Xenomelia" to describe this syndrome, which is derived from the Greek for "foreign" and "limb".

As of 2014, there was no medical consensus as to the cause of this condition.&lt;ref&gt;Sedda,Anna,Bottini,Gabriella, Apotemnophilia, body integrity identity disorder or xenomelia?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14436">The '''worm-like chain''' ('''WLC''') model in [[polymer physics]] is used to describe the behavior of [[polymers]] that are semi-flexible: fairly stiff with successive segments pointing in roughly the same direction, and with [[persistence length]] within a few orders of magnitude of the polymer length. The WLC model is the continuous version of the [[Otto Kratky|Kratky]]-[[Günther Porod|Porod]] model.

== Model elements ==
[[File:Worm-like Chain.png|thumb|An illustration of the WLC model, with position and unit tangent vectors as shown.|250x250px]] The WLC model envisions a continuously flexible [[isotropic]] rod.&lt;ref name=Doi&gt;{{cite book | author=Doi and Edwards | title=The Theory of Polymer Dynamics | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubinstein&gt;{{cite book | author=Rubinstein and Colby | title=Polymer Physics | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices | url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the [[Ideal chain|freely-jointed chain]] model, which is only flexible between discrete freely hinged segments. The model is particularly suited for describing stiffer polymers, with successive segments displaying a sort of cooperativity: nearby segments are roughly aligned. At room temperature, the polymer adopts a smoothly curved conformation; at &lt;math&gt;T = 0&lt;/math&gt; K, the polymer adopts a rigid rod conformation.&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;

For a polymer of maximum length &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;, parametrize the path of the polymer as &lt;math&gt;s \in(0,L_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Allow &lt;math&gt;\hat t(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the unit tangent vector to the chain at point &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\vec r(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the position vector along the chain, as shown to the right. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat t(s) \equiv \frac {\partial \vec r(s) }{\partial s}&lt;/math&gt; and the end-to-end distance &lt;math&gt;\vec R = \int_{0}^{L_0}\hat t(s) ds&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;

The energy associated with the bending of the polymer can be written as:

&lt;math&gt; E = \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial^2 \vec r(s) }{\partial s^2}\right )^{2} ds&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the polymer's characteristic [[persistence length]], &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature. At finite temperatures, the end-to end distance of the polymer will be significantly shorter than the maximum length &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is caused by thermal fluctuations, which result in a coiled, random configuration of the undisturbed polymer.

The polymer's orientation [[correlation function]] can then be solved for, and it follows an [[exponential decay]] with decay constant 1/P:&lt;ref name="Doi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat t(s) \cdot \hat t(0)\rangle=\langle \cos \; \theta (s)\rangle = e^{-s/P}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Crossover from flexible to stiff behavior in the worm-like chain polymer model.svg|thumb|300x300px|Mean squared end-to-end distance as a function of persistence length.]]

A useful value is the mean square end-to-end distance of the polymer:&lt;ref name="Doi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\langle R^{2} \rangle  = \langle \vec R \cdot \vec R \rangle
  = \left\langle \int_{0}^{L_0} \hat t(s) ds \cdot \int_{0}^{L_0} \hat t(s') ds' \right\rangle = \int_{0}^{L_0} ds \int_{0}^{L_0} \langle \hat t(s) \cdot \hat t(s') \rangle ds'= \int_{0}^{L_0} ds \int_{0}^{L_0} e^{-\left | s - s' \right | / P} ds' 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\langle R^{2} \rangle  
= 2 PL_0 \left [ 1 - \frac {P}{L_0} \left ( 1 - e^{-L_0/P} \right ) \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the limit of &lt;math&gt;L_0 \gg P&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle R^{2} \rangle = 2PL_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be used to show that a [[Kuhn length|Kuhn segment]] is equal to twice the [[persistence length]] of a worm-like chain. In the limit of &lt;math&gt;L_0 \ll P&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle R^{2} \rangle = L_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the polymer displays rigid rod behavior.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein" /&gt; The figure to the right shows the crossover from flexible to stiff behavior as the [[persistence length]] increases.

== Stretching worm-like chain polymers ==
Upon stretching, the accessible spectrum of thermal fluctuations reduces, which causes an entropic force acting against the external elongation.
This entropic force can be estimated from considering the total energy of the polymer:

&lt;math&gt; H = H_{\rm elastic} + H_{\rm external}= \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial^2 \vec r(s) }{\partial s^2}\right )^{2} ds - xF&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the [[contour length]] is represented by &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[persistence length]] by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the extension is represented by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and external force is represented by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.  
    	 
Laboratory tools such as [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) and [[optical tweezers]] have been used to characterize the force-dependent stretching behavior of biological polymers. An interpolation formula that approximates the force-extension behavior with about 15% relative error is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marko|first1=J.F.|last2=Siggia|first2=E.D.|title=Statistical mechanics of supercoiled DNA|journal=Phys. Rev. E|date=1995|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.52.2912|bibcode=1995PhRvE..52.2912M}}&lt;/ref&gt;	 
	 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0}&lt;/math&gt;
 	

A more accurate approximation for the force-extension behavior with about 1% relative error is:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrosyan|first=R.|title=Improved approximations for some polymer extension models|journal=Rehol Acta|year=2016|doi = 10.1007/s00397-016-0977-9|arxiv=1606.02519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0}-0.8 \left (\frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{2.15}&lt;/math&gt;
:

A corresponding approximation for the extension-force behavior, also with about 1% relative error, was reported:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {L_0} = \frac {4}{3} -  \frac {4} {3\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} + 1}} -\frac {10e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}} {\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}} \left(e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}-1 \right)^{2} } + \frac {\left (\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{1.62}} {3.55+3.8\left ( \frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{2.2}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Extensible worm-like chain model ==

The elastic response from extension cannot be neglected: polymers elongate due to external forces. This enthalpic compliance is accounted for the material parameter &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the system yields the following Hamiltonian for significantly extended polymers:

&lt;math&gt; H = H_{\rm elastic}+H_{\rm enthalpic}+H_{\rm external} = \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial \vec r(s) }{\partial s}\right )^{2} ds  +  \frac {1}{2}\frac {K_0}{L_0} x^{2}  -  xF &lt;/math&gt;,

This expression contains both the entropic term, which describes changes in the polymer conformation, and the enthalpic term, which describes the stretching of the polymer due to the external force. 
Several approximations for the force-extension behavior have been put forward, depending on the applied external force. These approximations are made for stretching DNA in physiological conditions (near neutral pH, ionic strength approximately 100 mM, room temperature), with stretch modulus around 1000&amp;nbsp;pN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Michelle D.|author2=Hong Yin|author3=Robert Landick|author4=Jeff Gelles|author5=Steven M.

For the low-force regime (F &lt; about 10&amp;nbsp;pN), the following interpolation formula was derived:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marko|first=J.F.|author2=Eric D.

&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} + \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0} - \frac {F}{K_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the higher-force regime, where the polymer is significantly extended, the following approximation is valid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odijk|first=Theo|title=Stiff Chains and Filaments under Tension|journal=Macromolecules|year=1995|volume=28|pages=7016–7018|bibcode = 1995MaMol..28.7016O |doi = 10.1021/ma00124a044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = L_0 \left ( 1 - \frac {1} {2} \left ( \frac {k_{B}T}{FP} \right )^{1/2} + \frac {F}{K_0}\right ) &lt;/math&gt;.

More accurate interpolation formulas for the force-extension and extension-force behaviors are:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0}+ \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0} - \frac {F}{K_0}-0.8 \left (\frac {x} {L_0}- \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{2.15}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {L_0} = \frac {4}{3} -  \frac {4} {3\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} + 1}} -\frac {10e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}} {\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}} \left(e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}-1 \right)^{2} } + \frac {\left (\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{1.62}} {3.55+3.8\left ( \frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{2.2}} + \frac {F}{K_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Załuski Library''' ({{lang-pl|Biblioteka Załuskich}}, {{lang-la|Bibliotheca Zalusciana}}) was built in [[Warsaw]] in 1747–1795 by [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother, [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], both [[Roman Catholic]] bishops. The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.&lt;ref name="utoronto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

After the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at [[Saint Petersburg]], where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded [[Imperial Public Library]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

In the 1920s the government of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] returned some of the former Załuski Library holdings to the recently established [[Second Polish Republic]] thanks to the [[Peace of Riga|Treaty of Riga]]. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]] in October 1944, following the collapse of the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Załuski Library under construction, by [[Zygmunt Vogel|Vogel]]]]
[[File:DPK1 DSC0038.JPG|thumb|left|250px|"House of the Kings" today (''ul. Daniłowiczowska 14'', corner of ''ul. Hipoteczna 2'', [[Warsaw]])]]
The Załuski brothers' greatest passion was [[book]]s. [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]] acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as [[Jakub Zadzik]], [[Krzysztof Opaliński]], Tomasz Ujejski, [[Janusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Jerzy Mniszech]] and [[Jan III Sobieski]] (the latter, from his granddaughter, [[Maria Karolina Sobieska]]).

From the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a [[library]], and in 1747 they founded the Załuski Library (''Biblioteka Załuskich''). Located in the 17th-century Daniłowicz Palace in [[Warsaw]] (built for [[Mikołaj Daniłowicz]] of Żurów),&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska"/&gt; the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical [[observatory]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; The building's reconstruction in [[rococo]] style was accomplished in 1745 by [[Francesco Antonio Melana]] and his brother.&lt;ref name="50 lat Biblioteki Narodowej, Warszawa, 1928-1978 (50 years of the National Library, Warsaw, 1928-1978)"/&gt;

The Załuski Library was considered the first Polish [[public library]]&lt;ref name="Bygone Warsaw"/&gt; and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings.&lt;ref name="welcometo"/&gt; The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, [[map]]s and [[manuscript]]s&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancour"/&gt; by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.

This library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Załuski brothers.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the [[pope]] for help.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Responding to their request, in 1752 pope [[Benedict XIV]] issued a [[papal bull]] that threatened to [[excommunication]] individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt;
[[File:Exlibris Zaluski.jpg|thumb|150px|Załuski Library ''[[Bookplate|exlibris]]'']] 
After the brothers' deaths, the newly formed [[Commission for National Education]] took charge of the library, renaming it the Załuski Brothers' Library of the Republic.

Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]], Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], emptied&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eduskrypt"/&gt; the library and dispatched the whole collection to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the books formed the mass of the [[Imperial Public Library]] on its formation, a year later.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Splendor of Letters: The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World"/&gt; Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; According to the historian [[Joachim Lelewel]], the Zaluskis' books, "could be bought at [[Grodno]] by the basket".&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;

The collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and the [[Treaty of Riga]]&lt;ref name="Lancour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation."/&gt; the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]'s government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; yet [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war.

In 1821 the library's original home was altered into a [[Kamienica (architecture)|tenement house]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt; During the building's reconstruction, the [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]] that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the [[Partitions of Poland]], were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the "House of the Kings" (''Dom pod Królami'').&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

The building was destroyed by the Germans during [[World War II]].  After the war, it was rebuilt under the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

Today's [[Polish National Library]] (''Biblioteka Narodowa''), founded in 1928,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; considers itself the descendant of the Załuski Library.

'''Zoogeography''' is the branch of the science of [[biogeography]] that is concerned with the geographic distribution (present and past) of [[animal]] [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;[[P. Jackson Darlington, Jr.|Darlington, P.J., Jr.]] 1957. ''Zoogeography: The Geographical Distribution of Animals.''

[[Philip Sclater]] (1858) and [[Alfred Wallace]] (1876) identified the main zoogeographic regions of the world used today: [[Palaearctic]], [[Aethiopian]] (today [[Afrotropic]]), [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] (today [[Indomalaya]]n), [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]], [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropical]].&lt;ref&gt;Sclater, P.L.

Marine regionalization began with [[Arnold Edward Ortmann|Ortmann]] (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Ortmann, A.E. (1896). ''Grundzüge der marinen Tiergeographie''. Jena: Gustav Fischer, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/82300#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrone, J. J. (2009). ''Evolutionary biogeography, an integrative approach with case studies''. Columbia University Press, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ednrWpMF3bMC].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way to [[geobotanic]] divisions, our planet is divided in zoogeographical (or faunal) regions (further divided as provinces, territories and districts), sometimes including the categories Empire and Domain.

The current trend is to classify the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology as [[biogeographic realm]]s.

Following, some examples of regionalizations:


* VI. Regio Neotropica

===Huxley (1868)===
Huxley (1868) scheme:&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T.H. 1868. On the classification and distribution of the Alectoromorphae and Heteromorpha. ''Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London'' 1868: 294-319, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/91104#page/372/mode/1up].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arctogea
** Nearctic province 
** Palaearctic province
** Ethiopian province 
** Indian province 
* Notogea
** Austro-Columbia province (= Neotropical)
** Australasia province (= Australian; Eastern Palaeotropical)

===Wallace (1876)===
* Palaearctic region
* Ethiopian region
* Oriental region
* Australaian region
* Neotropical region
* Nearctic region

===Darlington (1957)===
First scheme:
* Realm Megagea (Arctogea): the main part of the world 
** 1. Ethiopian Region: Africa (except the northern corner), with part of southern Arabia
** 2. Oriental Region: tropical Asia, with associated continental islands
** 3. Palearctic Region: Eurasia above the tropics, with the northern corner of Africa
** 4. Nearctic Region: North America, excepting the tropical part of Mexico
* Realm Neogea
** 5. Neotropical Region: South and Central America with the tropical part of Mexico 
* Realm Notogea
** 6. Australian Region: Australia, with New Guinea, etc.

Second scheme:
* Climate-limited regions
**  1. Palearctic Region
** 2. Nearctic Region
* Main regions of the Old World tropics
** 3. Oriental Region
** 4. Ethiopian Region
* Barrier-limited regions
** 5. Neotropical Region
** 6. Australian Region
