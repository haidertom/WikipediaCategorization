      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">[[File:Running boy in joyous mood 2.jpg|alt=A young boy running in a road. He has black hair and is wearing a backpack.|thumb|The [[running]] of a [[human]] could be considered an action.]]{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}{{About|the theory of action in general|[[Ludwig von Mises]]' work on this subject|Human Action}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Image of action.jpg|thumb|right|A throw (an action) a spear (with object) by man (by an agent)]] --&gt;
In [[philosophy]], an '''action''' is that which is done by an agent. In common speech, the term is often used interchangeably with the term "behaviour". However, in the [[Action theory (philosophy)|philosophy of action]], [[behavioural sciences]], and the [[social sciences]], a distinction is made: behavior is automatic and reflexive activity, while action is an intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful activity {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Thus, things like running or throwing a ball is an instance of action; it involves intention, a goal, and a bodily movement guided by the agent. On the other hand, catching a cold is not considered an action because it is something which happens ''to'' a person, not something done ''by'' one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Perception ==
In [[enactive|enactivism]] theory, perception is understood to be [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] in nature. That is, we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world. Alva Noë states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We move our eyes, head and body in taking in what is around us... [we] crane our necks, peer, squint, reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better look...'…'Perception is a mode of  activity on the part of the whole animal...It cannot be represented in terms of merely passive, and internal, processes...' &lt;ref&gt;Alva Noë [[Action in Perception]], (2004), MIT Press(pp1/2 and 111)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Movement==
Some would prefer to define actions as requiring [[Human body|bodily]] movement (see [[behaviorism]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The [[Unintended consequence|side effects]] of actions are considered by some to be part of the action; in an example from [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe]]'s manuscript ''Intention'', pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This introduces a [[moral]] dimension to the [[discussion]] (see also [[Moral agency]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the poisoned water resulted in a death, that death might be considered part of the action of the agent that pumped the water.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whether a side effect is considered part of an action is especially unclear in cases in which the agent isn't aware of the possible side effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  For example, an agent that accidentally cures a person by administering a poison he was intending to kill him with.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Reasons for action==
A primary concern of [[philosophy of action]] is to analyze the nature of actions and distinguish them from similar phenomena. Other concerns include individuating actions, explaining the relationship between actions and their effects, explaining how an action is related to the beliefs and desires which cause and/or justify it (see [[practical reason]]), as well as examining the nature of agency.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A primary concern is the nature of free will and whether actions are determined by the mental states that precede them (see [[determinism]]). Some philosophers (e.g. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;"Davidson, D. Essays on Actions and Events, 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001a.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Their mental properties don't seem to be doing any work.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action, however, are not the cause of the action, they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Humans are motivated to assign causes to their actions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G. B. (2005). Social cognition: Understanding self and others. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[social psychology]], '''attribution''' is the process by which individuals explain the causes of behavior and events. Models to explain this process are called '''attribution theory'''.&lt;ref name="social psy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kassin |last2=Fein |last3=Markus |title=Social Psychology |location=Wadsworth |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=Eighth international |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8400-3172-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological research into attribution began with the work of [[Fritz Heider]] in the early 20th century, and the theory was further advanced by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]].

==Background==
[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Fritz Heider]] is often described as the early-20th-century "father of attribution theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920s dissertation, Heider addressed the problem of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]]: why do perceivers attribute the properties such as color to perceived objects, when those properties are mental constructs? Heider's answer that perceivers attribute that which they "directly" sense – vibrations in the air for instance – to an object they construe as causing those sense data. "Perceivers faced with sensory data thus see the perceptual object as 'out there', because they attribute the sensory data to their underlying causes in the world."&lt;ref name=Malle&gt;{{cite book |last=Malle |first=Bertram F. |title=How the Mind Explains Behavior: Folk Explanations, Meaning, and Social Interaction |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-13445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

Heider extended this idea to attributions about people: "motives, intentions, sentiments&amp;nbsp;... the core processes which manifest themselves in overt behavior".&lt;ref name=Malle/&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

==Types==

===External===
External attribution, also called situational attribution, refers to interpreting someone's behavior as being caused by the situation that the individual is in. For example, if Jacob's car tire is punctured he may attribute that to a hole in the road; by making attributions to the poor condition of the highway, he can make sense of the event without any discomfort that it may in reality have been the result of his bad driving.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heider. F|year=1958|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|isbn=9780898592825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal===
The process of assigning the cause of behavior to some internal characteristic, rather than to outside forces.
This concept has overlap with the Locus of control, in which individuals feel they are personally responsible for everything that happens to them.

==Theories and models==

===Common sense psychology===
From the book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'' (1958), Fritz Heider tried to explore the nature of [[interpersonal relationship]], and espoused the concept of what he called "[[common sense]]" or "[[naïve psychology]]". In his theory, he believed that people observe, analyze, and explain behaviors with explanations. Although people have different kinds of explanations for the events of human behaviors, Heider found it is very useful to group explanation into two categories; Internal (personal) and external (situational) attributions.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lilienfeld |first=Scott O. |last2=Lynn |first2=Steven Jay |last3=Namy |first3=Laura L. |last4=Woolf |first4=Nancy J. |title=Psychology: A Framework For Everyday Thinking |place= |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2010 |chapter=Social Psychology |page=380 |isbn=978-0-205-65048-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an internal attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the individual's characteristics such as ability, personality, mood, efforts, attitudes, or disposition. When an external attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the situation in which the behavior was seen such as the task, other people, or luck (that the individual producing the behavior did so because of the surrounding environment or the social situation). These two types lead to very different perceptions of the individual engaging in a behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=106–108 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondent inference===
{{Main|Correspondent inference theory}}
Correspondent inferences state that people make inferences about a person when their actions are freely chosen, are unexpected, and result in a small number of desirable effects.&lt;ref name="social psy"/&gt; According to [[Edward E. Jones]] and Keith Davis' correspondent inference theory, people make correspondent inferences by reviewing the context of behavior. It describes how people try to find out individual's personal characteristics from the behavioral evidence. People make inferences on the basis of three factors; degree of choice, expectedness of behavior, and effects of someone's behaviors. For example, we believe we can make stronger&amp;nbsp;assumptions&amp;nbsp;about a man who gives half of his money to charity, than we can about one who gives $5 to charity. An average person would not want to donate as much as the first man because they would lose a lot of money. By donating half of his money, it is easier for someone to figure out what the first man's personality is like. The second factor, that affects correspondence of action and inferred characteristic, is the number of differences between the choices made and the previous alternatives. If there aren't many differences, the assumption made will match the action because it is easy to guess the important aspect between each choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipe|first1=Marlys G|title=Counterfactual reasoning as a framework for attribution theories|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=a455fc14-9779-4b61-91d9-828e8eff368b%40sessionmgr4010&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=1991-21263-001&amp;db=pdh|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covariation model===
{{Main|Covariation model}}
The covariation model states that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a behavior occurs and absent when it does not. Thus, the theory assumes that people make causal attributions in a rational, logical fashion, and that they assign the cause of an action to the factor that co-varies most closely with that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Harold H. |authorlink=Harold Kelley |chapter=Attribution Theory in Social Psychology |editor-first=David |editor-last=Levine |title=Nebraska Symposium on Motivation |location= |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |volume=15 |issue= |pages=192–238 |year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Kelley]]'s covariation model of attribution looks to three main types of information from which to make an attribution decision about an individual's behavior. The first is ''consensus information'', or information on how other people in the same situation and with the same stimulus behave. The second is ''distinctive information'', or how the individual responds to different stimuli. The third is ''consistency information'', or how frequent the individual's behavior can be observed with similar stimulus but varied situations. From these three sources of information observers make attribution decisions on the individual's behavior as either internal or external. There have been claims that people under-utilise consensus information, although there has been some dispute over this.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Attribution Theory|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/attribution-theory.html|website=Simply Psychology|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several levels in the covariation model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency is when the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the event or area of interest goes away quickly.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"/&gt;

===Three-dimensional model===
[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed that individuals have initial affective responses to the potential consequences of the intrinsic or extrinsic motives of the actor, which in turn influence future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiner |first=B. |year=1992 |title=Human Motivation: Metaphors, Theories and Research |location=Newbury Park, CA |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=0-7619-0491-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a person's own perceptions or attributions as to why they succeeded or failed at an activity determine the amount of effort the person will engage in activities in the future. Weiner suggests that individuals exert their attribution search and cognitively evaluate casual properties on the behaviors they experience. When attributions lead to positive affect and high expectancy of future success, such attributions should result in greater willingness to approach to similar achievement tasks in the future than those attributions that produce negative affect and low expectancy of future success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munton |last2=Silvester |last3=Stratton |last4=Hanks |title=Attributions in Action |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-98216-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, such affective and cognitive assessment influences future behavior when individuals encounter similar situations.

Weiner's achievement attribution has three categories:
# stable theory (stable and unstable)
# [[locus of control]] (internal and external)
# controllability (controllable or uncontrollable)

Stability influences individuals' expectancy about their future; control is related with individuals' persistence on mission; causality influences emotional responses to the outcome of task.

==Bias and errors==
While people strive to find reasons for behaviors, they fall into many traps of biases and errors. As Fritz Heider says, "our perceptions of causality are often distorted by our needs and certain [[cognitive biases]]".&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Donelson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher=Brooks/Cole |year=1987 |isbn=0-534-06744-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of attributional biases.

===Fundamental attribution error===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
The fundamental attribution error describes the habit to misunderstand dispositional or personality-based explanations for behavior, rather than considering external factors. The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain and assume the behavior of others. For example, if a person is overweight, a person's first assumption might be that they have a problem with overeating or are lazy and not that they might have a medical reason for being heavier set.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology Textbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When evaluating others' behaviors, the situational context is often ignored in favor of the disposition of the actor to be the cause of an observed behavior. This is because when a behavior occurs attention is most often focused on the person performing the behavior.  Thus, the individual is more salient than the environment and dispositional attributions are made more often than situational attributions to explain the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, when evaluating one's own behavior, the situational factors are often exaggerated when there is a negative outcome while dispositional factors are exaggerated when there is a positive outcome.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The core process assumptions of attitude construction models are mainstays of social cognition research and are not controversial—as long as we talk about "judgment". Once the particular judgment made can be thought of as a person's "attitude", however, construal assumptions elicit discomfort, presumably because they dispense with the intuitively appealing attitude concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwarz |first=N. |year=2006 |title=Attitude Research: Between Ockham's Razor and the Fundamental Attribution Error |journal=[[Journal of Consumer Research]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=19–21 |doi=10.1086/504124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture bias===
{{Main|Culture bias}}
Culture bias is when someone makes an assumption about the behavior of a person based on their cultural practices and beliefs. People in [[individualist]] cultures, generally [[Anglo-America]] and Anglo-Saxon European societies, value individuals, personal goals, and independence. People in [[collectivist]] cultures see individuals as members of groups such as families, tribes, work units, and nations, and tend to value conformity and interdependence. In other words, working together and being involved as a group is more common in certain cultures that views each person as a part of the community. This cultural trait is common in Asia, traditional Native American societies, and Africa. Research shows that culture, either individualist or collectivist, affects how people make attributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hongyin Wang |script-title=zh:跨文化心理学导论 |trans-title=Introduction to the Cross-Culture Psychology |location= |publisher=Shanxi Normal University Press |year=1993 |isbn=7-5613-0864-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from individualist cultures are more inclined to make fundamental-attribution error than people from collectivist cultures. Individualist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior due to their internal factors whereas collectivist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior to his external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perrius|first1=Chris|title=Individualism, collectivism, and attribution|url=https://blog.nationalequityproject.org/2011/03/11/individualism-collectivism-and-attribution/|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that individualist cultures engage in [[self-serving bias]] more than do collectivist cultures, i.e. individualist cultures tend to attribute success to internal factors and to attribute failure to external factors. In contrast, collectivist cultures engage in the opposite of self-serving bias i.e. self-effacing bias, which is: attributing success to external factors and blaming failure on internal factors (the individual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual and Cultural Differences in Person Perception|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/chapter/6-3-individual-and-cultural-differences-in-person-perception/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor/observer difference===
People tend to attribute other people's behaviors to their dispositional factors while attributing own actions to situational factors. In the same situation, people's attribution can differ depending on their role as actor or observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |last2=Nisbett |title=The Actor and the Observer: Divergent Perceptions of the Causes of Behavior |location=New York |publisher=General Learning Press |year=1971 |isbn=0-382-25026-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person scores a low grade on a test, they find situational factors to justify the negative event such as saying that the teacher asked a question that he/she never went over in class. However, if another person scores poorly on a test, the person will attribute the results to internal factors such as laziness and inattentiveness in classes. The theory of the actor-observer bias was first developed by E. Jones and R. Nisbett  in 1971, whose explanation for the effect was that when we observe other people, we tend to focus on the person, whereas when we are actors, our attention is focused towards situational factors. The actor/observer bias is used less frequently with people one knows well such as friends and family since one knows how his/her close friends and family will behave in certain situation, leading him/her to think more about the external factors rather than internal factors.{{original research inline|date=February 2015}}

===Dispositional attributions===
{{Main|Dispositional attribution}}
Dispositional attribution is a tendency to attribute people's behaviors to their dispositions; that is, to their personality, character, and ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew |title= The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=5|issue=4|year=1979 | pages=461–476 |doi=10.1177/014616727900500407 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248047301_The_Ultimate_Attribution_Error_Extending_Allport's_Cognitive_Analysis_of_Prejudice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, when a normally pleasant waiter is being rude to his/her customer, the customer may assume he/she has a bad temper. The customer, just by looking at the attitude that the waiter is giving him/her, instantly decides that the waiter is a bad person. The customer oversimplifies the situation by not taking into account all the unfortunate events that might have happened to the waiter which made him/her become rude at that moment. Therefore, the customer made dispositional attribution by attributing the waiter's behavior directly to his/her personality rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the whole "rudeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |last2=Folkes |title=Attribution Theory: Applications to Achievement, Mental Health, and Interpersonal Conflict |location= |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1990 |isbn=0-8058-0531-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-serving bias is attributing dispositional and internal factors for success, while external and uncontrollable factors are used to explain the reason for failure. For example, if a person gets promoted, it is because of his/her ability and competence whereas if he/she does not get promoted, it is because his/her manager does not like him/her (external, uncontrollable factor). Originally, researchers assumed that self-serving bias is strongly related to the fact that people want to protect their self-esteem.  However, an alternative information processing explanation is that when the outcomes match people's expectations, they make attributions to internal factors. For example, if you pass a test you believe it was  because of your intelligence; when the outcome does not match their expectations, they make external attributions or excuses. Whereas if you fail a test, you would give an excuse saying that you did not have enough time to study.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; People also use defensive attribution to avoid feelings of vulnerability and to differentiate themselves from a victim of a tragic accident.&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaver |first=Kelly G. |title=Defensive Attribution: Effects of Severity and Relevance on the Responsibility Assigned for an Accident |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=1970 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–113 |doi=10.1037/h0028777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative version of the theory of self-serving bias states that the bias does not arise because people wish to protect their private self-esteem, but to protect their self-image (a self-presentational bias). This version of the theory would predict that people attribute their successes to situational factors, for fear that others will disapprove of them looking overly vain if they should attribute successes to themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

For example, it is [[just-world hypothesis|suggested]] that coming to believe that "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people" will reduce feelings of vulnerability {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. This belief would have side-effects of [[blaming the victim]] even in tragic situations.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When a mudslide destroys several houses in a rural neighborhood, a person living in a more urban setting might blame the victims for choosing to live in a certain area or not building a safer, stronger house. Another example of attributional bias is [[optimism bias]] in which most people believe positive events happen to them more often than to  others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. For example, smokers on average believe they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roesch |last2=Amirkham |title= Boundary Conditions for Self-serving Attributions: Another Look at the Sports Pages |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |location= |publisher=  |year=1997 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=245–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb00631.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229546801_Boundary_Conditions_for_Self-serving_Attributions_Another_Look_at_the_Sports_Pages1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive attribution hypothesis===
{{Main|Defensive attribution hypothesis}}
The defensive attribution hypothesis is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] term referring to a set of beliefs held by an individual with the function of defending themselves from concern that they will be the cause or victim of a mishap. Commonly, defensive attributions are made when individuals witness or learn of a mishap happening to another person.  In these situations, attributions of responsibility to the victim or harm-doer for the mishap will depend upon the severity of the outcomes of the mishap and the level of personal and situational similarity between the individual and victim.  More responsibility will be attributed to the harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe, and as personal or situational similarity decreases.&lt;ref name="Shaver" /&gt;

An example of defensive attribution is the [[just-world hypothesis]], which is where "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people". People believe in this in order to avoid feeling vulnerable to situations that they have no control over. However, this also leads to blaming the victim even in a tragic situation.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When people hear someone died from a car accident, they decide that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident, and so they reassure themselves that an accident will never happen to them. Despite the fact there was no other information provided, people will automatically attribute that the accident was the driver's fault due to an internal factor (in this case, deciding to drive while drunk), and thus they would not allow it to happen to themselves.

Another example of defensive attribution is [[optimism bias]], in which people believe positive events happen to them more often than to others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. Too much optimism leads people to ignore some warnings and precautions given to them. For example, smokers believe that they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"/&gt;

==Application==

Attribution theory can be applied to juror decision making. Jurors use attributions to explain the cause of the defendant's intent and actions related to the criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moskowitz, G. B.|year=2005|title=Social cognition: Understanding self and others|location=New York, NY|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781593850852}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution made (situational or dispositional) might affect a juror's punitiveness towards the defendant.&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sommers, S. R.|author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Race in the courtroom: Perceptions of guilt and dispositional attributions|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=26|issue=11|pages=1367–1379|doi=10.1177/0146167200263005|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/sommersLab/documents/raceRealSommersEllsworth2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jurors attribute a defendant's behavior to dispositional attributions they tend to be more punitive and are more likely find a defendant guilty&lt;ref name=Sommers/&gt; and to recommend a death sentence compared to a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cochran, J. K.|author2=Boots, D. P.|author3=Heide, K.

==In clinical psychology==

Attribution theory has had a big application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Antaki, C.|editor2=Brewin, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=Attributions and psychological change: Applications of attributional theories to clinical and educational practice|location=London|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale developed a theory of the depressive attributional style, claiming that individuals who tend to attribute their failures to internal, stable and global factors are more vulnerable to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abramson, L. Y.|author2=Seligman, M. E.|author3=Teasdale, J. D. |lastauthoramp=y|year=1978|title=Learned helplessness in humans: critique and reformulation|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=49–74|pmid=649856|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ef52/775276f83a46162a9b364335d9ee5ee73b99.pdf|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) has been developed to assess whether individuals have the depressogenic attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peterson, C.|author2=Semmel, A.|author3=Von Baeyer, C.|author4=Abramson, L. Y.|author5=Metalsky, G. I.|author6=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=The attributional style questionnaire|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–299|doi=10.1007/BF01173577}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ASQ has been criticized, with some researchers preferring to use a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE) in which an individual's ordinary writings are analysed to assess whether s/he is vulnerable to the depressive attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schulman, P.|author2=Castellon, C.|author3=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title=Assessing explanatory style: The content analysis of verbatim explanations and the attributional style questionnaire|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=27|issue=5|pages=505–509|pmid=2818415|url=https://diamitch.home.xs4all.nl/artikels%20reveraat/science.pdf|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(89)90084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned helplessness===
{{Main|Learned helplessness}}
The concept of learned helplessness emerged from animal research in which psychologists [[Martin Seligman]] and Steven F. Maier discovered that dogs classically conditioned to an electrical shock which they could not escape, subsequently failed to attempt to escape an avoidable shock in a similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maier |last2=Seligman |title=Learned Helplessness: Theory and Evidence |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=3–46 |year=1976 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.105.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that learned helplessness applied to human psychopathology. In particular, individuals who [[Explanatory style|attribute]] negative outcomes to internal, stable and global factors reflect a view in which they have no control over their situation. It is suggested that this aspect of not attempting to better a situation exacerbates negative mood, and may lead to clinical depression and related mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=Martin |title=Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and Death |publisher=Freeman/Times Books/Henry Holt &amp; Co |year=1975 |isbn=0-7167-0752-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual salience==
{{Main|Perceptual salience}}
When people try to make attributions about another's behavior, their information focuses on the individual. Their perception of that individual is lacking most of the external factors which might affect the individual. The gaps tend to be skipped over and the attribution is made based on the perception information most salient. The most salient perceptual information dominates a person's perception of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=113–114 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals making behavioral attributions about themselves, the situation and external environment are entirely salient, but their own body and behavior are less so. This leads to the tendency to make an external attribution in regard to their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huffman |title=Psychology in Action |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |page=622 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Attribution theory has been criticised as being mechanistic and [[reductionist]] for assuming that people are rational, logical, and systematic thinkers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The fundamental attribution error, however, demonstrates that they are [[cognitive miser]]s and [[motivated tactician]]. It also fails to address the social, cultural, and historical factors that shape attributions of cause. This has been addressed extensively by [[discourse analysis]], a branch of psychology that prefers to use qualitative methods including the use of language to understand psychological phenomena. The [[linguistic categorization theory]] for example demonstrates how language influences our attribution style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''Biocomplexity''' is the study of complex structures and behaviors that arise from nonlinear interactions of active biological agents, which may range in scale from molecules to cells to organisms. Almost every biological system exhibits complexity - [[emergent properties]] where the ensemble possesses capabilities that its individual agents lack. Classical examples of biocomplexity include the behavior of [[molecular motor]]s during [[DNA transcription]], genetic and metabolic networks within cells, the interacting [[Cytoskeleton#The Eukaryotic Cytoskeleton|filament]]s of the [[cytoskeleton]], which allow the cell to move, the differentiation, organization and movement of cells during embryonic development, the function of the networks of neurons which compose the brain and the schooling of fish or birds. 

Primarily as a result of funding policy changes at the American [[National Science Foundation]] around 2000, some researchers have begun to use the term biocomplexity in a narrower sense to denote the [[complexity|complex]] behavioral, biological, social, chemical, and physical [[interaction]]s of [[life|living]] [[organism]]s with their [[natural environment|environment]]. This relatively new subfield of biocomplexity encompasses other domains such as [[biodiversity]] and [[ecology]].

Biocomplexity research aims to provide quantitative models of complex biological phenomena both to understand them in their own right and to interpret and guide quantiative biomedical experimentation.

[[Kluwer]] planned to publish a journal called ''Biocomplexity''. A disappointingly low number of submitted manuscripts resulted in the publisher cancelling the journal's launch issue.

{{Campaignbox Irish War of Independence}}

The '''Burning of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]''' by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] forces took place on the night of 11–12 December 1920, during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. It followed an [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) ambush of a British [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliary]] patrol in the city, which wounded twelve Auxiliaries, one fatally. In retaliation, the Auxiliaries, [[Black and Tans]] and [[British Army|British soldiers]] looted and burnt numerous buildings in the city centre. Many civilians reported being beaten, shot at, and robbed by British forces. Firefighters testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes through intimidation, cutting their hoses and shooting at them.

More than 40 business premises, 300 residential properties, [[Cork City Hall|the City Hall]] and Carnegie Library were destroyed by the fire. Over £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage (equivalent to €172&amp;nbsp;million today) was wrought, 2,000 were left jobless and many more became homeless. Two unarmed IRA volunteers were shot dead in the north of the city.

British forces carried out other reprisals on Irish civilians during the war, but the burning of Cork was one of the most significant. The British government at first denied that its forces had started the fires, and blamed the IRA. Later, a British Army inquiry concluded that a company of Auxiliaries were responsible.

==Background==
The Irish War of Independence began in 1919, following the [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declaration]] of an [[Irish Republic]] and its parliament, [[Dáil Éireann]]. The army of the new republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), waged guerrilla warfare against British forces: the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC). To help fight the IRA, the British Government formed the Auxiliary Division; a paramilitary unit composed of ex-soldiers from Britain which specialized in [[counter-insurgency]]. It also recruited thousands of British ex-soldiers into the RIC, who became known as "[[Black and Tans]]". IRA intelligence officer [[Florence O'Donoghue]] claimed the subsequent burning and looting of Cork was "not an isolated incident, but rather the large-scale application of a policy initiated and approved, implicitly or explicitly, by the British government".{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|pp=88–89}}

[[File:Outside the London and North Western Hotel in Dublin, April 21, 1921.jpg|thumb|A group of "Black and Tans" and Auxiliaries in Dublin, April 1921]]
[[County Cork]] was an epicenter of the war. On 23 November 1920, a "Black and Tan" in civilian dress threw a grenade into a group of IRA volunteers who had just left a brigade meeting on St Patrick Street in Cork. Three IRA volunteers of the 1st Cork Brigade were killed: Paddy Trahey, Patrick Donohue and Seamus Mehigan.{{sfn|Roinn Cosanta. Bureau of Military History|1956|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that sixteen people were injured.{{sfn|New York Times|1920}}

On 28 November 1920, the IRA's 3rd Cork Brigade ambushed an Auxiliary patrol [[Kilmichael Ambush|at Kilmichael]], killing 17 Auxiliaries. This was the biggest loss of life for the British in County Cork. On 10 December, British forces declared [[martial law]] in counties Cork (including the city), Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. It also imposed a military [[curfew]] on Cork city, which began at 10&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; each night. IRA volunteer Seán Healy later recalled that "at least 1,000 troops would pour out of Victoria Barracks at this hour and take over complete control of the city".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

==Ambush at Dillon's Cross==
IRA intelligence established that an Auxiliary patrol usually left [[Collins Barracks, Cork|Victoria Barracks]] (in the north of the city) each night at 8&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; and made its way to the city centre via Dillon's Cross. On 11 December, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue received intelligence that two lorries of Auxiliaries would be leaving the barracks that night and travelling with them would be British Army [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Captain James Kelly.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}} 

That evening, a unit of six IRA volunteers commanded by O'Donoghue took up position between the barracks and Dillon's Cross.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} Their goal was to destroy the patrol and capture or kill Captain Kelly. Five of the volunteers hid behind a stone wall while one, Michael Kenny, stood across the road dressed as an off-duty British officer. When the lorries neared he was to beckon the driver of the first lorry to slow down or stop.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} The neighbourhood was close (within a "couple of hundred yards") of a military barracks.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=93}}{{sfn|Bennett|2010}}

At 8&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, two lorries each carrying 13 Auxiliaries emerged from the barracks. The first lorry slowed when the driver spotted Kenny and, as it did so, the IRA unit attacked with grenades and revolvers.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} The official British report said that 12 members of the Auxiliary Division were wounded and that one, Temporary Cadet Spencer Chapman, a former Officer in the 4th Battalion London Regiment ([[Royal Fusiliers]]), died from his wounds shortly after.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Auxiliaries – Spencer R Chapman". Retrieved 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As the IRA unit made its escape, some of the Auxiliaries managed to fire their rifles in the direction of the volunteers while others dragged the wounded to the nearest cover: O'Sullivan's pub.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

The Auxiliaries broke into the pub with weapons drawn.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} They ordered everyone to put their hands over their heads to be searched. Backup and an ambulance were sent from the nearby barracks. One witness described a number of young men being rounded-up and forced to lie on the ground. The Auxiliaries dragged one of them to the middle of the crossroads, stripped him naked and forced him to sing "[[God Save the King]]" until he collapsed on the road.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

==Burning and looting==
[[File:Patrick Street Cork2.jpg|thumb|St Patrick's Street, Cork, c. 1900]]
Angered by an attack so near their headquarters and seeking retribution for the deaths of their colleagues at Kilmichael, the Auxiliaries gathered to wreak their revenge.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=111–12}} Charles Schulze, a member of the Auxiliaries and a former British Army Captain in the Dorsetshire Regiment during [[World War I]], organized a group of Auxiliaries to burn the centre of Cork.{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}}

At 9:30&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, lorries of Auxiliaries and British soldiers left the barracks and alighted at Dillon's Cross, where they broke into a number of houses and herded the occupants on to the street. They then set the houses on fire and stood guard as they were razed to the ground.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=94}} Those who tried to intervene were fired upon and some were badly beaten.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=111–12}} Seven buildings were set alight at the crossroads. When one was found to be owned by [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], the Auxiliaries quickly doused the fire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=114}}

At about the same time, a group of armed and uniformed Auxiliaries surrounded a tram at Summerhill, smashed its windows, and forced all the passengers out.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=95}} A number of the passengers (including at least three women) were repeatedly kicked, hit with rifle butts, threatened, and verbally abused. The Auxiliaries then forced the passengers to line-up against a wall and searched them, while continuing the physical and verbal abuse. Some had their money and belongings stolen.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=115–17}} Another tram was set alight near [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Mathew]]'s statue. Meanwhile, witnesses reported seeing a group of 14–18 [[Black and Tans]] firing wildly for upwards of 20 minutes on nearby MacCurtain Street.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=118-20}}

Soon after, witnesses reported groups of armed men on [[St Patrick's Street]], the city's main shopping area. Some were uniformed or partially uniformed members of the Auxiliaries and British Army while others wore no uniforms.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=121–25}} They were seen firing into the air, smashing shop windows and setting buildings alight. Many reported hearing bombs exploding. A group of Auxiliaries were seen throwing a bomb into the ground floor of the Munster Arcade, which housed both shops and flats. It exploded under the residential quarters while people were inside the building. They managed to escape unharmed but were detained by the Auxiliaries.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=121–25}}

[[File:CorkCity OldCityHall Single.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City Hall in the 1870s. The building was destroyed during the Burning of Cork]]
The fire brigade was informed of the fire at Dillon's Cross shortly before 10&amp;nbsp;pm and were sent to deal with it at once. However, on finding that Grant's department store on St Patrick's Street was ablaze, they decided to tackle it first.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=125}} The fire brigade's Superintendent, Alfred Hutson, called Victoria Barracks and asked them to tackle the fire at Dillon's Cross so that he could focus on the city centre. However, the barracks took no heed of his request. As he did not have enough resources to deal with all the fires at once, "he would have to make choices&amp;nbsp;– some fires he would fight, others he could not".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=126}}

Hutson oversaw the operation on St Patrick's Street, and met ''[[Cork Examiner]]'' reporter Alan Ellis. He told Ellis "that all the fires were being deliberately started by [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], and in several cases he had seen soldiers pouring cans of petrol into buildings and setting them alight".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=128}} 

A number of firemen later testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes by intimidating them, cutting their hoses and/or driving lorries over the hoses. They also said that firemen were shot at and that at least two were wounded by gunfire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=126-27}} Shortly after 3&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt;, ''Cork Examiner'' reporter Alan Ellis came upon a unit of the fire brigade pinned down by gunfire near City Hall. The firemen said that they were being shot at by Black and Tans who had broken into the building. They also claimed to have seen uniformed men carrying cans of petrol into the building from nearby Union Quay barracks.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}} 

At about 4&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; a large explosion was heard and City Hall and the neighbouring Carnegie Library went up in flames, resulting in the loss of many of the city's public records.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}}{{sfn|Cork History}} When more firefighters arrived, British forces fired at them and refused them access to water. The last act of arson took place at about 6&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; when a group of policemen looted and burnt the Murphy Brothers' clothes shop on Washington Street.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}}

==Shooting of the Delaney brothers==
After the ambush at Dillon's Cross, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue and volunteer James O'Mahony made their way to the Delaney farmhouse at Dublin Hill in the north of the city. Brothers Cornelius and Jeremiah Delaney were members of F Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Cork Brigade IRA.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}}

O'Donoghue hid a number of unused grenades on the farm and the two men went their separate ways.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=109}} At about 2&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside and were asked their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}}{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=101}} Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea,&lt;!-- is this correct spelling?? --&gt; was wounded by gunfire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=9}} According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}} It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used [[bloodhound]]s to follow the scent to the Delaney home.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=134}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Dublin saves Cork (17156792989).jpg|thumb|Fire engines sent from Dublin to help deal with the aftermath of the fires]]
Over 40 business premises and 300 residential properties had been destroyed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=244}} This amounted to over five acres of the city.{{sfn|Hidden History}} Over £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage (1920 value) was suffered, although the value of property looted by British forces was not clear. Many people became homeless and 2,000 were left jobless.{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}} Fatalities included an Auxiliary killed by the IRA, two IRA volunteers killed by Auxiliaries, and a woman who died from a heart-attack when Auxiliaries burst into her house. A number of people, including firefighters, had reportedly been assaulted or otherwise wounded.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=244}}

Florence O'Donoghue, intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork on the morning of the 12th:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many familiar landmarks were gone forever&amp;nbsp;– where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything was the all-pervasive smell of burning."{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=139}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At midday mass in the [[Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne|North Cathedral]] the [[Bishop of Cork]], [[Daniel Cohalan (bishop of Cork)|Daniel Cohalan]], condemned the arson but said the burning of the city was a result of the "murderous ambush at Dillon's Cross" and vowed, "I will certainly issue a decree of [[excommunication]] against anyone who, after this notice, shall take part in an ambush or a kidnapping or attempted murder or arson".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=140–42}} No excommunications, however, were issued, and the bishop's edict was largely ignored by pro-IRA priests and chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Pat Coogan|Coogan, Tim Pat]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=mZgmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT242&amp;lpg=PT242&amp;dq=in+the+wake+of+Cohalan%27s+edict+an+IRA+chaplain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TSDeLg9MJz&amp;sig=0tud90zXf3s9hcT0avgVTLfYj2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrvWHq67ZAhXOTd8KHZBRDqYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20wake%20of%20Cohalan%27s%20edict%20an%20IRA%20chaplain&amp;f=false "[[Patrick Clune|Clune]] arrived in Rome in the wake of the publicity over this decree and a growing belief, fostered by the British, that some priests were preaching that it was not a sin to shoot policemen. In fact the British were not entirely wide of the mark as the following letter to Florrie O'Donoghue, on Cohalan's edict, from the Chaplain to the Brigade shows"], ''Michael Collins: A Biography'', Head of Zeus Ltd, December 16, 2015 (524 pages); {{ISBN|1784975362}}/{{ISBN|9781784975364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting of Cork Corporation was held that afternoon at the Corn Exchange. Councillor [[James Walsh (Irish politician)|J.J. Walsh]] condemned the bishop for his comments, which he claimed held the Irish people up as the "evil-doers". Walsh said that while the people of Cork had been suffering, "not a single word of protest was uttered [by the bishop], and today, after the city has been decimated, he saw no better course than to add insult to injury". Councillor Michael Ó Cuill, alderman Tadhg Barry and the Lord Mayor, [[Daniel O'Callaghan (Cork politician)|Daniel O'Callaghan]], agreed with Walsh's sentiments. The members resolved that the Lord Mayor should send a telegram asking for the intervention of the European governments and the USA.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=143}}

Three days after the fire, on 15 December, two lorry-loads of Auxiliaries were travelling from [[Dunmanway]] to Cork for the funeral of Spencer Chapman, a comrade killed at Dillon's Cross. When they met two men (an elderly priest, Canon Magner, walking with a parishioner, a farmer's son) helping a resident magistrate fix his car, an Auxiliary, Vernon Anwyl Hart, got out and began questioning them, then shot Magner and his companion, Timothy (or Tadhg) Crowley. Both died of their injuries. A military court of inquiry heard that he had been a friend of Chapman and had been "drinking steadily" since his death. Hart was found guilty of murder, but insane.{{sfn|Leeson|2011|p=204}} At a subsequent investigation, one of the reasons given for his murder was that he refused to have the parish church bells tolled after the [[Kilmichael ambush]], in which 17 Auxiliaries were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theauxiliaries.com/INCIDENTS/magner-murder/magner-murder.html Canon Magner murder], theauxiliaries.com; accessed 17 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[File:Cork City Hall01 2009-04-30.jpg|thumb|The re-built Cork City Hall, completed in the 1930s]]
Irish nationalists called for an open and impartial inquiry.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=102}} In the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Sir [[Hamar Greenwood]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], refused demands for such an inquiry. He denied that British forces had any involvement and accused the IRA of starting the fires.{{sfn|Cork History}}{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=148}} When asked about reports of firefighters being hampered by British forces he said "Every available policeman and soldier in Cork was turned out at once and without their assistance the fire brigade could not have gone through the crowds and did the work that they tried to do".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=148}}

[[Bonar Law]] said "in the present condition of Ireland, we are much more likely to get an impartial inquiry in a military court than in any other".{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=102}} The British military launched its own inquiry, the "Strickland Report",&lt;ref name="greenwoodheckled"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/17/103546888.pdf "Greenwood heckled on Strickland Report"], ''The New York Times'', 17 February 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; but Cork Corporation instructed its employees and other corporate officials to take no part.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=103}} The report pointed the finger of blame at members of the Auxiliaries' K Company, based at Victoria Barracks. The Auxiliaries, it was claimed, set the fires in reprisal for the IRA attack at Dillon's Cross.{{sfn|Cork History}} However, the British Government refused to publish the report.&lt;ref name="greenwoodheckled"/&gt;

The [[Irish Trades Union Congress|Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress]] published a pamphlet in January 1921 entitled ''Who burned Cork City?'' The work drew on evidence from hundreds of eyewitness which suggested that the fires had been set by British forces and that British forces had prevented firefighters from tackling the blaze.{{sfn|Hidden History}} The material was compiled by the President of [[University College Cork]], [[Alfred O'Rahilly]].{{sfn|Cork History}}

K&amp;nbsp;Company Auxiliary Charles Schulze, a former British Army Captain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theauxiliaries.com/men-alphabetical/men-s/schultze-cfl/schulze.html Charles Schulze profile], theauxiliaries.com; accessed 17 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in a letter to his girlfriend in England that it was "sweet revenge", while in a letter to his mother he wrote: "Many who had witnessed [[World War I|scenes in France and Flanders]] say that nothing they had experienced was comparable with the punishment meted out in Cork".{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}} After the fire, K Company was moved to Dunmanway and began wearing burnt corks in their caps in reference to the burning of the city.{{sfn|Hidden History}} For their part in the arson and looting, K Company was disbanded on 31 March 1921.{{sfn|Leeson|2011|p=101}}

There has been debate over whether British forces at Victoria Barracks had planned to burn the city before the ambush at Dillon's Cross, whether the British Army itself was involved, and whether those who set the fires were being commanded by superior officers.&lt;!--NOTE: we should include quotes here from the British military and others who disagree with this conclusion--&gt; Florence O'Donoghue, who was intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What appears more probable is that the ambush provided the excuse for an act which was long premeditated and for which all arrangements had been made. The rapidity with which supplies of petrol and [[Verey lights]] were brought from Cork barracks to the centre of the city, and the deliberate manner in which the work of firing the various premises was divided amongst groups under the control of officers, gives evidence of organisation and pre-arrangement. Moreover, the selection of certain premises for destruction and the attempt made by an Auxiliary officer to prevent the looting of one shop by Black and Tans: 'You are in the wrong shop; that man is a Loyalist' and the reply, 'We don't give a damn; this is the shop that was pointed out to us', is additional proof that the matter had been carefully planned beforehand."{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|pp=93–94}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Cegléd water jug''' ({{lang-hu|'Ceglédi kanna'}}) is a container for water named after the city of [[Cegléd]], Hungary. It is also used as a [[musical instrument]] in [[folk music]], in particular, in [[Romani music]] of Hungary.&lt;ref name=cepa&gt;[http://www.cegledipanorama.hu/index.php/lexikon/2163-cegl%C3%A9di-kanna.html "Ceglédi kanna"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225094258/http://www.cegledipanorama.hu/index.php/lexikon/2163-cegl%C3%A9di-kanna.html |date=2015-02-25 }}, ''Ceglédi Panorama''; lexicon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Container==

A Cegléd [[jug (container)|jug]] is a 7&amp;ndash;9 liter metal jug for water, with a handle and a lid. It is a relatively modern invention. They were first manufactured by a János Rónay  in Cegléd in the 1910s. Before the wide distribution of [[water pipelines]], Cegléd jugs were popular for delivery of water to farmers during harvest, construction and other workers away from residential places.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt; They quickly became popular, because they were not fragile like pottery jugs, easy to carry by hand, on bicycle or in a car, and were easy to clean. Since there was only one manufacturer for a long time, the name stuck.&lt;ref name=mava&gt;[http://www.magyarvagyok.com/kultura/hungarikum/nepi-hangszerek/idiofonok/1103-Cegledi-kanna.html "Ceglédi kanna"], ''Magyar Vagyok'',  Zoltán Kabai, September 15, 2010 (retrieved February 28, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Cegléd jugs were made of galvanized tin. Later they were made of  aluminium and steel, both bare metal and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) was made of a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, the mouth and bottom rims were doubly folded.  The handle was attached by rivets.&lt;ref name=mava/&gt;

==Musical instrument==
Cegléd jugs became a rhythm musical instrument among Romani in 1970 through the 1980s. The first usage of the jug is attributed to Károly Rostás ("Huttyán"). Later it was perfected by other Roma musicians, such as [[Kalyi Jag (group)|Kalyi Jag]].&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/kultura/20091127-brummogo_bogo_helyett_cegledi_kanna-443961 "Brummogó bőgő helyett ceglédi kanna"], László Rab, ''NOL'' (''[[Népszabadság]]'' Online), November 27, 2009 (retrieved February 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When hit by palms, Cegléd jugs produce a wide variety of sounds, depending on the place hit (handle, body, rim), whether it is struck or slapped, whether the jug mouth is muffled, etc.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt;  The combination of metal sound and deep dull sound of the air cavity puts the instrument in categories of [[idiophone]]s and [[wind instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sárosi, Bálint ''Hangszerek a magyar néphagyományban'' (" Musical Instruments in Hungarian Folklore"), Budapest, Planétás, 1998, {{ISBN|9639014354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 and 2009, two ''Ceglédi KannaBál'' festivals, that highlighted this musical instrument, took place.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt; In addition to traditional Romani music, the festival featured [[reggae]], [[jazz]] and [[blues music]] bands which used  Ceglédi jugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.hu/archivum/3728.html "1.

Traditionally, the theory of [[retributive justice]] is based on the ideas of [[revenge|retaliation]] ([[punishment]]), which is valuable in itself, and also provides [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retributive Justice|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the police, [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] of execution or imprisonment were thought pretty efficient at this, while at the same time removing the threat criminals pose to the public (protection). Alternative sentences add to these goals, trying to reform the offender ([[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]), and put right what he did ([[Reparation (legal)|reparation]]).

Traditionally, [[Victimology|victims of a crime]] only played a small part in the criminal justice process, as this breaching the rules of the society. The [[restorative justice|restorative approach to justice]] approach often makes it a part of a sentence for the offender to apologize, compensate the damage they have caused or repair it with their own labour.

The shift towards alternative sentencing means that some offenders avoid imprisonment with its many unwanted consequences. This is beneficial for the society, as it may prevent them from getting into the so-called [[Recidivism|the revolving door syndrome]], the inability of a person to go back to normal life after leaving a prison, becoming a [[Habitual offender|career criminal]]. Furthermore, there are hopes that this could alleviate [[prison overcrowding]] and reduce the cost of punishment.

Instead of depriving those who commit less dangerous offences (such as [[summary offence]]s) of their freedom, the courts put some limitations on them and give them some duties. The list of components that make up a community sentence is of course different in individual countries, and will be combined individually by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Sentences|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/types_of_sentences.html|website=Citizens Information|publisher=Citizens Information Board, Ireland|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-custodial sentences can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alternative Sentencing|journal=ABA Journal|date=1 November 1987|volume=73|issue=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2yX6rsuuJ4C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meeting in York.JPG|thumb|A [[#Quaker|Quaker]] business meeting]]
[[File:Shimer assembly applause.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Shimer College]] Assembly reaching a consensus through deliberation.]]

'''Consensus decision-making''' is a [[group decision-making]] process in which group members develop, and agree to support a decision in the best interest of the whole. Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the "favourite" of each individual. It has its origin in the [[Latin]] word ''cōnsēnsus'' (agreement), which is from ''cōnsentiō'' meaning literally ''feel together''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus |title=Consensus - Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary  |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe both the decision and the process of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social, economic, legal, environmental and political effects of applying this process.

==Objectives==
As a decision-making process, consensus decision-making aims to be:&lt;ref name="cdmsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consensusdecisionmaking.org/ |title=Consensus Decision-making How to use consensus process |publisher=Consensusdecisionmaking.org |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Agreement Seeking:''' A consensus decision-making process attempts to generate as much agreement as possible.&lt;ref name="cdmsite" /&gt;
*'''[[Collaboration|Collaborative]]:''' Participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible.&lt;ref name="CODM book"&gt;Hartnett, T. (2011). Consensus-Oriented Decision Making. Gabriola Island, BC, Canada:New Society Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Cooperation|Cooperative]]:''' Participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences.
*'''[[Egalitarianism|Egalitarian]]:''' All members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded, as much as possible, equal input into the process. All members have the opportunity to present, and amend proposals.
*'''[[Inclusion (value and practice)|Inclusive]]:''' As many [[wiktionary:stakeholder|stakeholders]] as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process.
*'''[[Participation (decision making)|Participatory]]:''' The consensus process should actively solicit the input and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] of all decision-makers.&lt;ref name="Sandelin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/nica/Process/Consensusbasics.htm#Ingredients |title=Consensus Basics, Ingredients of successful consensus process |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Rob Sandelin |work=Northwest Intentional Communities Association guide to consensus |publisher=Northwest Intentional Communities Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209124816/http://www.ic.org/nica/Process/Consensusbasics.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative to common decision-making practices==
Consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced [[group decision-making]] processes.&lt;ref name="Basics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groupfacilitation.net/Articles%20on%20Meeting%20Facilitation.html |title=Articles on Meeting Facilitation, Consensus, Santa Cruz California |publisher=Groupfacilitation.net |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', for instance, is a guide book used by many organizations. This book allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through [[majority]] vote. It does not emphasize the goal of full agreement. Critics of such a process believe that it can involve adversarial debate and the formation of competing factions. These dynamics may harm group member relationships and undermine the ability of a group to cooperatively implement a contentious decision. Consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems. Proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include:&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tree Bressen (2006), [http://treegroup.info/topics/Consensus_Decison_Making-CH.pdf Consensus Decision Making]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Better decisions: Through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns.
*Better implementation: A process that includes and respects all parties, and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions.
*Better group relationships: A cooperative, collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection.

==Decision rules==
Consensus is not synonymous with "unanimity"&amp;ndash; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process.  The level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a "decision rule".&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaner, S. (2011). Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-making. San Francisco, CA:Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible decision rules for consensus include:

#Person-in-charge decides
#Executive committee decides
#Simple majority
#[[Super majority]] thresholds (90%, 80%, 75%, two-thirds, and 60% are common).
#Consensus voting
#Condorcet consensus
#[[Unanimity|Unanimous]] agreement
#[[Unanimous consent]] (See Arriving at consensus below)
#Unanimous agreement minus one vote or two votes
#Unanimous consent minus one vote or two votes

Some groups use a consensus process to generate as much agreement as possible, but allow participants to finalize decisions with a decision rule that does not require unanimity. In such cases dissenters still must live with the decision.  Groups that require unanimous agreement or consent (unanimity) may have their decisions blocked by objection by any participant. These groups use the term consensus to denote both the discussion process and the decision rule. It is by definition the most difficult to achieve, but also the most durable, since everyone involved has given their consent.

===Arriving at consensus===
[[Consent]] must be 'genuine and cannot be obtained by force, duress or fraud.'&lt;ref&gt;Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226 (Supreme Court of Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; Giving consent does not necessarily mean that the proposal being considered is one’s first choice. Group members can vote their consent because they choose to cooperate with the direction of the group, rather than insist on their personal preference. Sometimes the vote on a proposal is framed, “Is this proposal something you can live with?”  This relaxed threshold for a yes vote can achieve full consent. However, the values of consensus are not realized if consent is given merely because dissenting participants are frustrated with the process and wanting to move on.

The process of achieving consent deliberately seeks objections, which reveal wisdom that can be used to improve proposals and agreements. An objection is a reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of satisfying needs or goals, which the proposal aims to satisfy. Consent implies the absence of reasonable objections, that is, objections strong enough to deny giving it.

===Consensus in majority or super-majority decision rules===
A consensus process can also be concluded with a majority or super-majority vote. This is especially common or useful in large and diverse groups that share the values underlying consensus. Consensus process, by definition, seeks the maximum possible levels of agreement or consent. Thus, if a group using a majority vote decision rule is dominated by a majority faction that does not seek the agreement of all participants, the process would not be considered "consensus." Regardless of the decision rule, the process is only "consensus" if it has embodied the value of striving for full agreement or consent. Sometimes the outcomes of consensus can be contrary to majority.

=== Condorcet consensus ===
Condorcet consensus is defined as a decision achieved by the [[Condorcet method]], in which a winner (winning proposal, etc.) is that which can win a head-to-head contest with any other under consideration.  It does not require unanimous or near-unanimous consensus - which cannot be realistically reached in large group sizes - but maximizes satisfaction rate. It can also be argued that when a Condorcet consensus is reached, further deliberation will only strengthen and further specify this consensus.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== Consensus voting ===
The outcome of a multi-option ballot, if measured according to the Condorcet rule, will often be the same as the outcome of another preferential form of multi-option voting, the [[Modified Borda Count]], MBC. If the outcome applying the latter meets any predetermined decision rule, it may be regarded as the consensus.

===Near-unanimous consensus===
Healthy consensus decision-making processes usually encourage expression of [[dissent]] early, maximizing the chance of accommodating the views of all minorities. Since unanimity may be difficult to achieve, especially in large groups, or consent may be the result of [[coercion]], fear, undue persuasive power or eloquence, inability to comprehend alternatives, or plain impatience with the process of debate, consensus decision-making bodies may use an alternative decision rule, such as '''Unanimity Minus One''' (or U−1), or '''Unanimity Minus Two''' (or U−2).

==Blocking and other forms of dissent==
To ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued, many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule. Groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision. This provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted. Proper guidelines for the use of this option, however, are important. The ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences. When there is potential for a block to a group decision, both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached. Simply [[vetoing]] a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking. Some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include:&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian, D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xYjrCkmCOagC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=consensus&amp;f=false Creating a Life Together: Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages and Intentional Communities]. (2003). Gabriola Island, BC, Canada:New Society Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “stand aside” rather than block.
*Requiring a block from two or more people to put a proposal aside.
*Requiring the blocking party to supply an alternative proposal or a process for generating one.&lt;ref name="Canadian Cohousing Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohousing.ca/consensus.htm |title=The Consensus Decision Process in Cohousing |accessdate=2007-01-28 |author= |work= |publisher=Canadian Cohousing Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226135255/http://www.cohousing.ca/consensus.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Limiting each person’s option to block consensus to a handful of times in one’s life.
*Limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions.
*Limiting the allowable rationale for blocking to issues that are fundamental to the group’s mission or potentially disastrous to the group.

===Dissent options===
A participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it. Some common options may include the ability to:
*'''Declare reservations:''' Group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose "declare reservations." If there are significant reservations about a motion, the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augustana.ca/rdx/bruneau/documents/PDM%20in%20an%20Intercultural%20context.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025409/http://www.augustana.ca/rdx/bruneau/documents/PDM%20in%20an%20Intercultural%20context.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=If Agreement Cannot Be Reached |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Richard Bruneau |year=2003 |format=DOC |page=37 |work=Participatory Decision-Making in a Cross-Cultural Context |publisher=Canada World Youth |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stand aside:''' A "stand aside" may be registered by a group member who has a "serious personal disagreement" with a proposal, but is willing to let the motion pass. Although stand asides do not halt a motion, it is often regarded as a strong "nay vote" and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal. Stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontierus.org/documents/consensus.htm |title=FRONTIER: A New Definition |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Consensus Development Project |year=1998 |work= |publisher=Frontier Education Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212140902/http://www.frontierus.org/documents/consensus.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcdc.coop/Resources/CSS/CSS08Intro2Consensus.pdf |title=Consensus Decision-Making |accessdate=2012-12-09 |author=Rachel Williams |author2=Andrew McLeod |year=2008 |format=PDF |work=Cooperative Starter Series |publisher=Northwest Cooperative Development Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211654/http://www.nwcdc.coop/Resources/CSS/CSS08Intro2Consensus.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.webofoz.org/consensus.shtml | title = Amazing Graces' Guide to Consensus Process | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Dorcas |author2=Ellyntari | year = 2004 | work = | publisher =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Object:''' Any group member may "object" to a proposal. In groups with a unanimity decision rule, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal. Other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass (see previous section, ''[[Consensus decision-making#Decision rules|Decision rules]]'').

==Process models==
The basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves:
*Collaboratively generating a proposal
*Identifying unsatisfied concerns
*Modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible

All attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement, regardless of decision rule threshold.

===Specific models===
In the '''{{vanchor|spokescouncil|Spokescouncil}}''' model, [[affinity groups]] make joint decisions by each designating a speaker and sitting behind that circle of spokespeople, akin to the [[spoke]]s of a wheel. While speaking rights might be limited to each group's designee, the meeting may allot breakout time for the constituent groups to discuss an issue and return to the circle via their spokesperson. In the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the [[Washington A16, 2000|A16 Washington D.C. protests in 2000]], affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil's imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines. They received the reprieve of letting groups self-organize their protests, and as the city's protest was subsequently divided into pie slices, each blockaded by an affinity group's choice of protest. Many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly, and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others' concerns and voicing their own.&lt;ref name="HaworthElmore2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeppesen|first1=Sandra|last2=Adamiak|first2=Joanna|chapter=Street Theory: Grassroots Activist Interventions in Regimes of Knowledge |editor-last1=Haworth|editor-first1=Robert H.|editor-last2=Elmore|editor-first2=John M.|title=Out of the Ruins: The Emergence of Radical Informal Learning Spaces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291|year=2017|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-62963-319-0|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus Voting====
The group first elects, say, three referees or consensors.
The debate on the chosen problem is initiated by the facilitator calling for proposals.
Every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the UN Charter on Human Rights.
The referees produce and display a list of these options.
The debate proceeds, with queries, comments, criticisms and/or even new options.
If the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus, the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate.
When all agree, the chair calls for a preferential vote, as per the rules for a Modified Borda Count, MBC.
The referees decide which option, or which composite of the two leading options, is the outcome. If its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient, it may be adopted.

====Blocking====

Groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.consensusdecisionmaking.org/ | title = The Basics of Consensus Decision Making | accessdate = 2015-02-17 | author = | date = 2015-02-17 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  ConsensusDecisionMaking.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/c-t-butler-and-amy-rothstein-on-conflict-and-consensus-a-handbook-on-formal-consensus-decisionm |title=What is Consensus? |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author= |year=2005 |work= |publisher=The Common Place |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015105352/http://www.thecommonplace.org.uk/information.php?page=articles&amp;iID=4 |archivedate=October 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consens#proc | title = The Process | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = | date = 2005-12-01 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  Seeds for Change }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an agenda for discussion has been set and, optionally, the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon, each item of the agenda is addressed in turn. Typically, each decision arising from an agenda item follows through a simple structure:
*'''Discussion of the item:''' The item is discussed with the goal of identifying opinions and information on the topic at hand. The general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion.
*'''Formation of a proposal:''' Based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group.
*'''Call for consensus:''' The facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal. Each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent, stand aside, or object, often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card, to avoid the group [[Warnock's dilemma|interpreting silence or inaction as agreement]].  The number of objections is counted to determine if this step's consent threshold is satisfied.  If it is, dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement, so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized.  ''This can happen even if the consent threshold is unanimity, especially if many voters stand aside.''
*'''Identification and addressing of concerns:''' If consensus is not achieved, each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal, potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern.
*'''Modification of the proposal:''' The proposal is amended, re-phrased or [[Rider (legislation)|ridered]] in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers. The process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group.

====Quaker-based model====
[[Quaker]]-based consensus&lt;ref name = Quaker&gt;Quaker Foundations of Leadership (1999).

The Quaker model has been adapted by [[Earlham College]] for application to secular settings, and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process.

Its process includes:
&lt;!--NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE FORM USED BY THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS, but rather an ADAPTATION by Earlham College that has been widely used in secular settings. The text is a paraphrase of SOURCED material, so please do not modify it beyond its original intent. --&gt;
*Multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear.
*Discussion involves [[active listening]] and sharing information.
*Norms limit number of times one asks to speak to ensure that each speaker is fully heard.
*Ideas and solutions belong to the group; no names are recorded.
*Ideally, differences are resolved by discussion. The [[facilitator]] ("clerk" or "convenor" in the Quaker model) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper.
*The facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion, asks if there are other concerns, and proposes a "[[Minutes|minute]]" of the decision.
*The group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group.
*The facilitator can discern if one who is not uniting with the decision is acting without concern for the group or in selfish interest.
*Ideally, all dissenters' perspectives are synthesized into the final outcome for a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name = Quaker/&gt;
*Should some dissenter's perspective not harmonize with the others, that dissenter may "stand aside" to allow the group to proceed, or may opt to "block".  "Standing aside" implies a certain form of silent consent.  Some groups allow "blocking" by even a single individual to halt or postpone the entire process.&lt;ref name="Quaker group facilitator"/&gt;

Key components of Quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common [[Human condition|humanity]] and the ability to decide together. The goal is "unity, not unanimity."  Ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought. The facilitator is understood as serving the group rather than acting as person-in-charge.&lt;ref&gt;Quaker Foundations of Leadership (1999).

Retrieved on 2009-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quaker model, as with other consensus decision-making processes, articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them.  As members' views are taken into account they are likely to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Maine.gov.

====CODM model====
The consensus-oriented decision-making&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consensusbook.com/ "Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to Widespread Agreement"&lt;/ref&gt; (CODM) model offers a detailed step-wise description of consensus process. It can be used with any type of decision rule. It outlines the process of how proposals can be collaboratively built with full participation of all stakeholders. This model lets groups be flexible enough to make decisions when they need to, while still following a format based on the primary values of consensus decision-making. The CODM steps include:
# Framing the topic
# Open discussion
# Identifying underlying concerns
# Collaborative proposal building
# Choosing a direction
# Synthesizing a final proposal
# Closure
Some of the specific contributions of the CODM model include: 1) Starting important topics with open discussion rather than by presenting a pre-formulated proposal, so that a truly collaborative process can ensue. 2) Gathering a list of all needs and concerns expressed by the group to form criteria for all potential proposals to address. 3) taking turns in a unified attempt to build each proposal idea into the best possible proposal before choosing between them. And 4) using empathy in the closure stage to address any unresolved feelings from the process.

====Overlaps with deliberative methods====
Consensus decision-making models overlap significantly with [[Deliberation|deliberative methods]], which are processes for structuring discussion that may or may not be a lead-in to a decision.

==Roles==
The consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively. Although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group, the most common are the [[facilitator]], [[consensor]], a timekeeper, an empath and a secretary or notes taker. Not all decision-making bodies use all of these roles, although the facilitator position is almost always filled, and some groups use supplementary roles, such as a [[Devil's advocate]] or greeter. Some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants, and prevent any perceived concentration of power.&lt;ref name="FNB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/pnp/ocac/ |title=On Conflict and Consensus |accessdate=2011-10-31 |author=C.T.

The common roles in a consensus meeting are:
*'''Facilitator:''' As the name implies, the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier. Facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process; and, if necessary, suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques, such as go-arounds, break-out groups or role-playing.&lt;ref name="Kerrigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2004/09/how_to_use_a_co.php |title=How To Use a Consensus Process To Make Decisions |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Sheila Kerrigan |year=2004 |work= |publisher=Community Arts Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619051520/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2004/09/how_to_use_a_co.php |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otesha.ca/bike+tours/bike+tour+resources/meeting+facilitation.en.html#toc_taking_comments |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312023053/http://www.otesha.ca/bike%2Btours/bike%2Btour%2Bresources/meeting%2Bfacilitation.en.html#toc_taking_comments |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-03-12 |title=Guides: Meeting Facilitation |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Lori Waller |work= |publisher=[[The Otesha Project]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consensus groups use two co-facilitators. Shared [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]] is often adopted to diffuse the perceived power of the facilitator and create a system whereby a co-facilitator can pass off facilitation duties if he or she becomes more personally engaged in a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.reclaiming.org/resources/consensus/blakey.html | title = Meeting Facilitation – The No-Magic Method | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Berit Lakey | year = 1975 | work = | publisher =  Network Service Collaboration }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Consensor:''' The team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the UN Charter on Human Rights; for displaying an initial list of these options; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent MBC ballot; and, if need be, to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options.
*'''Timekeeper:''' The purpose of the timekeeper is to ensure the decision-making body keeps to the schedule set in the agenda. Effective timekeepers use a variety of techniques to ensure the meeting runs on time including: giving frequent time updates, ample warning of short time, and keeping individual speakers from taking an excessive amount of time.&lt;ref name = "FNB" /&gt;
*'''Empath or 'Vibe Watch':''' The empath, or 'vibe watch' as the position is sometimes called, is charged with monitoring the 'emotional climate' of the meeting, taking note of the body language and other [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal cues]] of the participants. Defusing potential emotional conflicts, maintaining a climate free of intimidation and being aware of potentially destructive power dynamics, such as sexism or racism within the decision-making body, are the primary responsibilities of the empath.&lt;ref name = "Kerrigan"/&gt;
*'''Note taker:''' The role of the notes taker or secretary is to document the decisions, discussion and action points of the decision-making body.

==Tools and methods==
{{repetition|section|date=November 2015}}

===Non-verbal techniques===
Non-verbal means of expression can also reduce contention or keep issues from spreading out in time across an entire meeting.  Various methods of agenda control exist, mostly relying on an explicit chairperson with the power to interrupt off-topic or rambling discourse. This gets more difficult if there is no such chair and accordingly the attitude of the entire group must be assessed by each speaker. Verbal interruptions inevitably become common, possibly in the form of grumbling, muttering, and eventually sharp words, if there is no effective means of cutting off persons making false factual statements or rambling off a topic.

The [[Levi Hand Signal Technique]] (LHST) employed by [[Otesha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otesha.ca/content/meeting-facilitation|title=Meeting Facilitation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "allows meeting participants to register their intent to make two distinct kinds of comments: those that are directly in response to someone else's comment ('reactive comments') and those that are separate thoughts ('unique comments'). Intent to register a reactive comment is signaled by a different hand signal than is intent to register a unique comment. We used an index finger for the former and a full hand for the latter."  This clears direct responses to a contentious comment faster—and makes it harder to insert it in a long speakers' list and count on a long delay between the utterance and the challenge to create the appearance of agreement.

"Twinkling fingers", similarly, is a nonverbal way of expressing strong agreement, similar to applause but without the interruption and possibly less intimidation of disagreement than applause or cheers can create. The [[Occupy movement]] has used these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otesha.org.uk/blog/1107/random/twinkle-twinkle-little-fingers-consensus-in-action.html|title=Otesha UK : Twinkle twinkle little fingers – consensus in action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colored cards===
[[File:Consensus Cards.svg|200px|thumb|Front face, back face and embossing mask for colored consensus cards]]
Some consensus decision-making bodies use a system of colored cards to speed up and ease the consensus process. Most often, each member is given a set of three colored cards: red, yellow and green. The cards can be raised during the process to indicate the member's input. Cards can be used during the discussion phase as well as during a call for consensus. The cards have different meanings, depending on the phase in which they are used.&lt;ref name="Canadian Cohousing Network"/&gt; The meaning of the colors are:
*'''Red:''' During discussion, a red card is used to indicate a point of process or a breach of the agreed upon procedures. Identifying offtopic discussions, speakers going over allowed time limits or other breaks in the process are uses for the red card. During a call for consensus, the red card indicates the member's opposition (usually a "principled objection") to the proposal at hand. When a member, or members, use a red card, it becomes their responsibility to work with the proposing committee to come up with a solution that works for everyone.
*'''Yellow:''' In the discussion phase, the yellow card is used to indicate a member's ability to clarify a point being discussed or answer a question being posed. Yellow is used during a call for consensus to register a stand aside to the proposal or to formally state any reservations.
*'''Green:''' A group member can use a green card during discussion to add to the speakers list. During a call for consensus, the green card indicates consent.
Some decision-making bodies use a modified version of the colored card system with additional colors, such as orange to indicate a non-blocking reservation stronger than a stand-aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mosaic-commons.org/colorcards | title = Color Cards | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | work = | publisher =  Mosaic Commons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{vanchor|Hand signals}}===
[[Hand gestures|Hand signals]] are often used by consensus decision-making bodies as a way for group members to nonverbally indicate their opinions or positions. They have been found useful in facilitating groups of 6 to 250 people.  They are particularly useful when the group is multi-lingual.&lt;ref&gt;[Jan Havercamp, "Non-verbal communication – a solution for complex group settings", Zhaba facilitators collective, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and meaning of individual gestures varies from group to group.  Nonetheless, there is a widely adopted core set of hand signals. These include: wiggling of the fingers on both hands, a gesture sometimes referred to as "twinkling", to indicate agreement; raising a fist or crossing both forearms with hands in fists to indicate a block or strong disagreement; and making a "T" shape with both hands, the "time out" gesture, to call attention to a point of process or order.&lt;ref name="Guides" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zhaba.cz/uploads/media/Shared_Path.pdf |title=A Handbook for Direct Democracy and the Consensus Decision Process |accessdate=2007-01-18 |format=PDF |publisher=Zhaba Facilitators Collective |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714080721/http://www.zhaba.cz/uploads/media/Shared_Path.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/handsig.pdf |title=Hand Signals |accessdate=2007-01-18 |format=PDF |publisher=Seeds for Change |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225024/http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/handsig.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common set of hand signals is called the "Fist-to-Five" or "Fist-of-Five". In this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus, one finger to suggest changes, two fingers to discuss minor issues, three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion, four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea, and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/Fist2Five.htm |title=Guide for Facilitators: Fist-to-Five Consensus-Building |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher=Freechild.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupy hand signals|A similar set of hand signals]] are used by the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protesters in their group negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52799991-75/park-pioneer-homeless-occupy.html.csp|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|author=The Salt Lake Tribune|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common set of hand signals used is the "Thumbs" method, where Thumbs Up=agreement; Thumbs Sideways=have concerns but won't block consensus; and Thumbs Down=I don't agree and I won't accept this proposal. This method is also useful for "straw polls" to take a quick reading of the group's overall sentiment for the active proposal.

A slightly more detailed variation on the thumbs proposal can be used to indicate a 5-point range: (1) Thumb-up=strongly agree, (2) Palm-up=mostly agree, (3) Thumb Sideways="on the fence" or divided feelings, (4) Palm down=mostly disagree, and (5) Thumb down=strongly disagree.

'''Other useful hand signs include:'''
* Clarifying Question – using your hand to form a "C" shape to indicate that you have a clarifying question, often this hand sign means that a person is invited to ask their question before a vote is taken.
* Point of Information – pointing your index finger upwards to indicate that you have some important factual information that relates to the discussion or decision at hand.
* Process Point – forming a triangle with your hands or hands and arms to indicate that you have an important concern with the meeting or decision-making process.

===Dotmocracy sheets===
[[File:BikeCamp09-Dotmocracy-37.JPG|thumb|Completed Dotmocracy sheet]]
[[Dotmocracy]] sheets provide a way to visibly document levels of agreement among participants on a large variety of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;http://dotmocracy.org Dotmocracy facilitator's resource website&lt;/ref&gt; Participants write down ideas on paper forms called ''Dotmocracy sheets'' and fill in one dot per sheet to record their opinion of each idea on a scale of "strong agreement", "agreement", "neutral", "disagreement", "strong disagreement" or "confusion". Participants sign each sheet they dot and may add brief comments. The result is a graph-like visual representation of the group's collective opinions on each idea.

===Fall-back methods===
Sometimes some common form of voting such as [[First-past-the-post]] is used as a ''fall-back method'' when consensus cannot be reached within a given time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Saint S, Lawson JR (1994) ''Rules for reaching consensus: a modern approach to decision making.'' Pfeiffer, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt;
However, if the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated, then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied. Special fall-back methods have been developed that reduce this incentive.&lt;ref name = "SCFC"&gt;Heitzig J, Simmons FW (2010). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-010-0517-y Some Chance For Consensus] ''Soc Choice Welf'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some specific fall-back methods include:
*"Seasoning" the topic by allowing time to pass before continuing the discussion, with the hope that time will bring resolution to unresolved differences.
* In consensus voting, if the outcome of any ballot fails to pass the predetermined threshold consensus coefficient - in other words, if there is no consensus - no decision is taken, and the debate is resumed in a search for more options.
* Delegating the unresolved topic to a committee that includes representatives of the differing viewpoints so that the differences can be resolved without absorbing too much time in a whole group meeting.
* Using a super-majority decision-rule when an issue is brought back to the whole group after seasoning or discussion in a committee.
* Assigning a committee to rule on whether a "blocking" vote satisfies the criteria for a legitimate block (i.e. Is the block based on a core value? or Is this the type of decision that can be "blocked?")

==Criticism==

===Criticism of blocking===
Critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option, while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]], has a number of possible shortcomings, notably
*'''Preservation of the status quo:''' In decision-making bodies that use formal consensus, the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs. This can mean that a specific state of affairs can continue to exist in an organization long after a majority of members would like it to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/collectivebook/introductiontoconsensus.html |title=Introduction to Consensus |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=The Common Wheel Collective |year=2002 |work=The Collective Book on Collective Process |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630154451/http://geocities.com/collectivebook/introductiontoconsensus.html |archivedate=2006-06-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive to block can however be removed by using a special kind of voting process.&lt;ref name = "SCFC"/&gt;
*'''Susceptibility to widespread disagreement:''' Giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual. When a popular proposal is blocked the group actually experiences widespread disagreement, the opposite of the consensus process's goal. Furthermore, "opposing such obstructive behavior [can be] construed as an attack on freedom of speech and in turn [harden] resolve on the part of the individual to defend his or her position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.connected.org/govern/consensus.html | title = Consensus building and verbal desperados | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Alan McCluskey | year = 1999 | work = | publisher =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, consensus decision-making has the potential to reward the least accommodating group members while punishing the most accommodating.
*'''Stagnation and group dysfunction:''' When groups cannot make the decisions necessary to function (because they cannot resolve blocks), they may lose effectiveness in accomplishing their mission.
*'''Susceptibility to splitting and excluding members:''' When high levels of group member frustration result from blocked decisions or inordinately long meetings, members may leave the group, try to get to others to leave, or limit who has entry to the group.
*'''Channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process:''' When group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process, they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee. In some cases members begin to act unilaterally because they are frustrated with a stagnated group process.

===Groupthink===
Consensus seeks to improve [[solidarity]] in the long run.  Accordingly, it should not be confused with [[unanimity]] in the immediate situation, which is often a symptom of [[groupthink]].  Studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or "illusion of unanimity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch Cline | first1 = Rebecca J | year = 1990 | title = Detecting groupthink: Methods for observing the illusion of unanimity | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463379009369748| journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 112–126| doi=10.1080/01463379009369748}}&lt;/ref&gt; that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure (when dissent reappears). [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Ralph Nader]] and other proponents of [[deliberative democracy]] or judicial-like methods view the explicit dissent as a symbol of strength.

In his book about Wikipedia, [[Joseph Reagle]] considers the merits and challenges of consensus in open and online communities.&lt;ref name="Reagle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Joseph M. Reagle Jr.]]|chapter=The challenges of consensus|chapterurl=http://reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc/chapter-5.html|title=[[Good Faith Collaboration|Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia]]|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=30 September 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01447-2|page=100}} Available for free download in multiple formats at: {{Internet Archive|id=GoodFaithColaboration|name=Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Schutt,&lt;ref&gt;Schutt, Randy (August 31, 2010).

Unanimous, or apparently unanimous, decisions can have drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Institutional Law|page=547
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004187987|isbn=9004187987
|first1=Henry G. |last1=Schermers|first2=Niels M. |last2=Blokker|year=2011|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may be symptoms of a [[systemic bias]], a rigged process (where an [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent), fear of speaking one's mind, a lack of creativity (to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage (to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent).

Unanimity is achieved when the full group apparently consents to a decision.  It has disadvantages insofar as further disagreement, improvements or better ideas then remain hidden, but effectively ends the debate moving it to an implementation phase.  Some consider all unanimity a form of groupthink, and some experts propose "coding systems...for detecting the illusion of unanimity symptom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463379009369748 |title=Detecting groupthink: Methods for observing the illusion of unanimity |journal=Communication Quarterly |volume=38 |number=2 |first=Rebecca J. Welch |last=Cline |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/01463379009369748 |pages=112–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Consensus is not Unanimity'', consensus practitioner and activist leader [[Starhawk]] wrote:

:''Many people think of consensus as simply an extended voting method in which every one must cast their votes the same way. Since unanimity of this kind only rarely occurs in groups with more than one member, groups that try to use this kind of process usually end up being either extremely frustrated or coercive. Either decisions are never made (leading to the demise of the group, its conversion into a social group that does not accomplish any tasks), they are made covertly, or some group or individual dominates the rest. Sometimes a majority dominates, sometimes a minority, sometimes an individual who employs "the block". But no matter how it is done, it is NOT consensus.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/consensus-nu.html Consensus is not Unanimity]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221133434/http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/consensus-nu.html |date=February 21, 2014 }}, Starhawk. &lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion between unanimity and consensus, in other words, usually causes consensus decision-making to fail, and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands.

Most robust models of consensus exclude uniformly unanimous decisions and require at least documentation of minority concerns.  Some state clearly that unanimity is not consensus but rather evidence of intimidation, lack of imagination, lack of courage, failure to include all voices, or deliberate exclusion of the contrary views.

===Criticism of majority voting processes===
Some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use [[majority rule]] as undesirable for several reasons. Majority [[voting]] is regarded as [[Competition|competitive]], rather than [[cooperation|cooperative]], framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the possibility of [[compromise]] or other mutually beneficial solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/all-news-english/display-single-english-news/browse/4/article/1634/consensus-a-colourful-fa-1.html |title=Consensus: a colourful farewell to majority rule |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Friedrich Degenhardt |year=2006 |work= |publisher=World Council of Churches |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206132304/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/all-news-english/display-single-english-news/browse/4/article/1634/consensus-a-colourful-fa-1.html |archivedate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Santiago Nino, on the other hand, has argued that majority rule leads to better deliberation practice than the alternatives, because it requires each member of the group to make arguments that appeal to at least half the participants.&lt;ref&gt;McGann, Anthony J.

McGann | year = 2002 | format = PDF | work = | publisher = Center for the Study of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, opponents of majority rule claim that it can lead to a '[[tyranny of the majority]]', a scenario in which a majority places its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression.  Some voting theorists, however, argue that majority rule may actually prevent tyranny of the majority, in part because it maximizes the potential for a minority to form a coalition that can overturn an unsatisfactory decision.&lt;ref name="tyranny" /&gt;

Some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision. Members of a minority position may feel less commitment to a majority decision, and even majority voters who may have taken their positions along party or bloc lines may have a sense of reduced responsibility for the ultimate decision. The result of this reduced commitment, according to many consensus proponents, is potentially less willingness to defend or act upon the decision.

Majority voting cannot measure consensus. Indeed - so many 'for' and so many 'against' - it measures the very opposite, the degree of dissent. Consensus voting, in contrast, the Modified Borda Count, MBC, can identify the consensus of any electorate, whenever such a consensus exists. Furthermore, the rules laid down for this procedure can be the very catalyst of consensus.

== Examples ==

Outside of Western culture, multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making. Perhaps the oldest example is the [[Grand Council of the Six Nations|Iroquois Confederacy Grand Council]], or [[Iroquois#The Haudenosaunee|Haudenosaunee]], which has used consensus in decision-making using a 75% super majority to finalize decisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.paulkeeslerbooks.com/Chap5Iroquois.html |chapter=League of the Iroquois |author=M.

The technique was also used during the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-summit-indaba-idUSKBN0TT29C20151210|title=Climate talks turn to South African indaba process to unlock deal|date=10 December 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/572623/this-simple-negotiation-tactic-brought-195-countries-to-consensus-in-the-paris-climate-talks/|title=This simple negotiation tactic brought 195 countries to consensus|first=Akshat|last=Rathi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aceh]] and [[Nias]] cultures (Indonesian), family and regional disputes, from playground fights to estate inheritance, are handled through a ''musyawarah'' consensus-building process in which parties mediate to find peace and avoid future hostility and revenge. The resulting agreements are expected to be followed, and range from advice and warnings to compensation and exile.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/29208/complaint-handling-rehabilitation.pdf p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUBqeHJdp1oC&amp;pg=PA72|title=Regional Security in Southeast Asia: Beyond the ASEAN Way|first=Mely Caballero|last=Anthony|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the modern popularity of consensus decision-making in Western society dates from the [[women's liberation movement]] of the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=4796 |title=Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=David Graeber |author2=Andrej Grubacic |year=2004 |publisher=ZNet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217152815/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=4796 |archivedate=February 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-nuclear movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://san.beck.org/GPJ29-AntiNuclearProtests.html |title=Anti-Nuclear Protests |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Sanderson Beck |year=2003 |publisher=Sanderson Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of formal consensus can be traced significantly further back.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=14 |title=Participation in Unanimous Decision-Making: The New England Monthly Meetings of Friends |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Ethan Mitchell |year=2006 |publisher=Philica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of early Western consensus practitioners are the [[Religious Society of Friends]], or Quakers, who adopted the technique as early as the 17th century. [[Anabaptists]], including some [[Mennonite]]s, have a history of using consensus decision-making&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionjournal.org/article/?676 |title=Church Leadership: A Historical Perspective |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Abe J. Dueck |year=1990 |publisher=Direction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some believe Anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the [[Martyrs' Synod]] of 1527.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; Some Christians trace consensus decision-making back to the Bible. The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia references, in particular, Acts 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameo.org/index.asp?content=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/C6667ME.html |title=Consensus |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Ralph A Lebold |year=1989 |work=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044601/http://www.gameo.org/index.asp?content=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gameo.org%2Fencyclopedia%2Fcontents%2FC6667ME.html |archivedate=March 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of consensus in the New Testament.  The lack of legitimate consensus process in the unanimous conviction of Jesus by corrupt priests&lt;ref name="Pagels1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elaine Pagels|title=The Origin of Satan: How Christians Demonized Jews, Pagans, and Heretics|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_origin_of_Satan.html?id=xH8N73-b428C|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1996|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-679-73118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an illegally held [[Sanhedrin]] court (which had rules preventing unanimous conviction in a hurried process) strongly influenced the views of pacifist Protestants, including the Anabaptists (Mennonites/Amish), Quakers and Shakers. In particular it influenced their distrust of expert-led courtrooms and to "be clear about process" and convene in a way that assures that "everyone must be heard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/node/166|title=AT 11: Conflict and Church Decision Making: Be clear about process and let everyone be heard - The Anabaptist Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus voting was first advocated by (a) Ramón Llull in 1199. Next by (b) Nicholas Cusanus in 1435. Then by (c) Jean-Charles de Borda in 1784. Later by (d) Hother Hage in 1860 and (e) Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in 1884. And finally by (f) Peter Emerson in 1986. With the possible exception of (e), none of these 'inventors' knew anything about the inventions of any of their predecessors.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits [[Mollie Hunter]] (1922–2012) with following quotation regarding [[consensus]]: "No single group has the right to ignore a consensus of thoughtful opinion"&lt;ref&gt;"Consensus ad idem: a protocol for development of consensus statements." ''Can J Surg'' 2013; 56 (6); 365 http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/30b550e2#/30b550e2/6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese business===
Japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making, meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Japanese Organization and Decision-making|page=121

===IETF rough consensus model===
In the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), decisions are assumed to be taken by ''[[rough consensus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2418}}. "IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures."&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF has studiously refrained from defining a mechanical method for verifying such consensus, apparently in the belief that any such codification leads to attempts to "[[game the system]]." Instead, a [[IETF Working Group|working group]] (WG) chair or [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|BoF]] chair is supposed to articulate the "sense of the group."

One tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than (countable) hand-raising; this allows a group to quickly tell the difference between "one or two objectors" or a "sharply divided community", without making it easy to slip into "[[majority rule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.ietf.org/tao.html | title = The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | year = 2006 | work = | publisher =  The Internet Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the business of the IETF is carried out on [[mailing list]]s, where all parties can speak their view at all times.

===Social constructivism model===
In 2001, [[Robert Rocco Cottone]] published a consensus-based model of professional decision-making for counselors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Cottone, R. R. (2001). The social constructivism model of ethical decision making. "Journal of Counseling and Development," vol. 79, pp. 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[social constructivist]] philosophy, the model operates as a consensus-building model, as the clinician addresses ethical conflicts through a process of negotiating to consensus. Conflicts are resolved by consensually agreed on arbitrators who are defined early in the negotiation process.

===US Bureau of Land Management collaborative stakeholder engagement===
The United States [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects, plans, and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law, regulation, or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new, or reaffirming existing, precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/adr_conflict_prevention.Par.44228.File.dat/ADR.pdf |title=Bureau of Land Management National Natural Resources Policy for Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement and Appropriate Dispute Resolution |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Bureau of Land Management |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114185803/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/adr_conflict_prevention.Par.44228.File.dat/ADR.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern large-group [[Quakers|Quaker]] processes===
{{anchor|Quaker}}
FUM/FGC Friends conduct business in yearly meetings of perhaps 100 to 500 participants. Over the last three centuries they have evolved a number of practices peculiar to their aims. The following practices are traditional in both New York Yearly Meeting and in New England Yearly Meeting:
* A typical yearly meeting session has a presiding clerk, one or two recording clerks and a reading clerk on stage. Partitioning the work load with extra clerks lowers the stress level on the presiding clerk.
* Business sessions start with a period of corporate silent worship.
* A period of silent worship, perhaps thirty seconds, is allotted by the presiding clerk after each person speaks. This slows the pace of the business meeting down and allows people to contemplate people's messages.
* The use of wireless microphones helps to slow down the pace of the meeting. Volunteer microphone runners are instructed to walk at a reasonably slow pace toward someone standing and waiting to be recognized.
* The clerk often recognizes who speaks first, then second, then third.
* A pastoral care team upholds the presiding clerk, or simply the clerk, in prayer.
* Attempts are made to take minor editing functions off of the floor of the meeting. Minutes are polished by a committee before presenting them on the meeting floor. All suggested small corrections are incorporated either on the spot by the caucusing clerks, or at a special impromptu meeting after the current business session ends. Corrected minutes are then brought back onto the floor of the meeting at a later date.
* Major, complex concerns result in a called threshing session, a meeting of people most concerned about the issue.
* New England Yearly Meeting has discovered the benefits of anchor groups, groups of about ten participants who meet every day during a multi-day yearly meeting. People sometimes need to vocalize their personal opinions on issues to a few other people, in part because people think aloud.

Every 20 or 30 years, each yearly meeting's consensus practices are re-codified in a new edition of that yearly meeting's Faith and Practice book.

==Additional criticism from biblical and philosophical perspectives==
As a notable example of the failure of unanimity in the [[Western canon]], New Testament historian [[Elaine Pagels]] cites the [[Sanhedrin]]'s unanimous vote to convict [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref name="Pagels1996" /&gt; To a Jewish audience familiar with that court's requirement to set free any person unanimously convicted as not having a proper defense, Pagels proposes that the story is intended to signal the injustice of unanimous rush to agreement and Jesus' lack of a defender.&lt;ref name="Pagels1996" /&gt; She cites the shift away from this view and towards preference for visible unanimity as a factor in later "demonization" of Jews, pagans, heretics (notably [[Gnostic]]s) and others who disagreed with orthodox views in later Christianity. Unanimity, in other words, became a priority where it had been an [[anathema]].

Some formal models based on [[graph theory]] attempt to explore the implications of suppressed [[dissent]] and subsequent sabotage of the group as it takes action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5629466%2F5641665%2F05641917.pdf%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5641917%26punumber%3D5629466 |title=Error: |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040906/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5629466%2F5641665%2F05641917.pdf%3Ftp%3D&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466 |archivedate=May 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-stakes decision-making, such as judicial decisions of appeals courts, always require some such explicit documentation. Consent however is still observed that defies factional explanations. Nearly 40% of Supreme Court of US decisions, for example, are unanimous, though often for widely varying reasons. "Consensus in Supreme Court voting, particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity, has often puzzled Court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2669346?uid=3739432&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47698918057047|title=The Norm of Consensus on the U.S. Supreme Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence is mixed on whether particular Justices' views were suppressed in favour of public unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01249.x/full|title=Consensus, Disorder, and Ideology on the Supreme Court | doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01249.x | volume=9|issue=1|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|pages=129–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method to achieve more agreement to satisfy a strict threshold a voting process under which all members of the group have a strategic incentive to agree rather than block.&lt;ref name="SCFC" /&gt; However, this makes it very difficult to tell the difference between those who support the decision and those who merely tactically tolerate it for the incentive. Once they receive that incentive, they may undermine or refuse to implement the agreement in various and non-obvious ways. In general [[voting system]]s avoid allowing offering incentives (or "bribes") to change a heartfelt vote.

*[[Abilene paradox]]: Consensus decision-making is susceptible to all forms of [[groupthink]], the most dramatic being the [[Abilene paradox]]. In the Abilene paradox, a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jerry B.|last= Harvey|journal=Organizational Dynamics|date=Summer 1974|volume= 3|issue=1|title=The Abilene Paradox and other Meditations on Management|doi=10.1016/0090-2616(74)90005-9|pages=63–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Time Consuming: Since consensus decision-making focuses on discussion and seeks the input of all participants, it can be a time-consuming process. This is a potential liability in situations where decisions must be made speedily, or where it is not possible to canvass opinions of all delegates in a reasonable time. Additionally, the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/strat-ldr-dm/pt3ch11.html |title=Consensus Team Decision Making |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=|work=Strategic Leadership and Decision Making |publisher=National Defense University }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a decision has been reached it can be acted on more quickly than a decision handed down. American businessmen complained that in negotiations with a Japanese company, they had to discuss the idea with everyone even the janitor, yet once a decision was made the Americans found the Japanese were able to act much quicker because everyone was on board, while the Americans had to struggle with internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomalin |first1=Barry |last2=Knicks |first2=Mike |title=The World's Business Cultures and How to Unlock Them |chapter=Consensus or individually driven decision- |publisher=Thorogood Publishing, |year=2008 |page=109 |isbn=978-1-85418-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments. 

== Overview ==
Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

== Examples ==
Examples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:
* [[Bill Cosby]]'s daughters&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/obama-cultural-mulatto_b_41576.html|title = Obama: Cultural Mulatto|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Remove unsourced and pointless claim. Every set in every topological space is a union of isolated points.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">In [[mathematics]], a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a [[topological space]] is said to be '''dense-in-itself''' if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains no [[isolated point]]s.

Every dense-in-itself [[closed set]] is [[perfect set|perfect]]. Conversely, every perfect set is dense-in-itself.

A simple example of a set which is dense-in-itself but not closed (and hence not a perfect set) is the subset of [[irrational numbers]] (considered as a subset of the [[real numbers]]). This set is dense-in-itself because every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of an irrational number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one other irrational number &lt;math&gt;y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, this set of irrationals is not closed because every [[rational number]] lies in its [[closure (topology)|closure]]. For similar reasons, the set of rational numbers (also considered as a subset of the [[real numbers]]) is also dense-in-itself but not closed.

The above examples, the irrationals and the rationals, are also [[dense set]]s in their topological space, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. As an example that is dense-in-itself but not dense in its topological space, consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. This set is not dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; but is dense-in-itself.

== Privacy Types ==

=== Information Privacy ===
''Main article: [[Information privacy|Information Privacy]]''

In the context of digital privacy, [[information privacy]] is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to [[personally identifiable information]], is collected and used. The [[European Union|EU]] has various [[Privacy law|laws]] that dictate how information may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, [[privacy law]] is argued by some to be less developed in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uoltj2&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Privacy Law in the United States, the EU and Canada: The Allure of the Middle Ground 2 University of Ottawa Law &amp; Technology Journal 2005|last=|first=|date=|website=heinonline.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By example, some legislation, or lack of, allows companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information. 

=== Communication Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, communications can be [[Secure communication|intercepted]] or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sushmitha|first=R.|date=|title=HACKING METHODS, TECHNIQUES AND THEIR PREVENTION|url=http://www.researchpublish.com/download.php?file=HACKING%20METHODS%20TECHNIQUES%20AND%20THEIR%20PREVENTION-256.pdf&amp;act=book|journal=International Journal of Computer SCience and INformation Technology Research|volume=Vol. 2, Issue 2|pages=183-189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender because of false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example of this is failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/94-of-australians-do-not-read-all-privacy-policies-that-apply-to-them-and-thats-rational-behaviour-96353|title=94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them – and that’s rational behaviour|last=Kemp|first=Katharine|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, companies frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijer|first=Ronald|last2=Conradie|first2=Peter|last3=Choenni|first3=Sunil|date=2014|title=Reconciling Contradictions of Open Data Regarding Transparency, Privacy, Security and Trust|url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-18762014000300004&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Journal of theoretical and applied electronic commerce research|volume=9|issue=3|pages=32–44|doi=10.4067/S0718-18762014000300004|issn=0718-1876|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current technologies.

=== Individual Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon.  

== Anonymity  ==

=== Information Anonymity ===
The following examples are systems that allow a user to remain anonymous when accessing the web, and by extension the use of which better ensures the protection of their [[personally identifiable information]].  

[[Onion routing|Onion Routing]] was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and was intended to anonymize web traffic. The system created a path to any TCP/IP server by creating a pathway of onion routers. Once a pathway has been established, all information that is sent through it is anonymously delivered. When the user has finished utilizing the pathway it was essentially deleted which freed the resources to be used for a new pathway within Onion Routing. The [[The Onion Routing Project|Onion Routing project]] developed into what is today known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|TOR]], a completely open-sourced and free software. Unlike its predecessor, Onion Routing, Tor is able to protect both the anonymity of individuals as well as web providers.This allows people to set up anonymous web servers which in effect provides a censorship-resistant publishing service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ye11dQQ5CbcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=digital+privacy+study&amp;ots=CXxNO9M5Ke&amp;sig=hxB3kxTMyiCjs_F8dPQeNYlIMiw#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20privacy&amp;f=false|title=Digital Privacy: Theory, Technologies, and Practices|last=Acquisti|first=Alessandro|last2=Gritzalis|first2=Stefanos|last3=Lambrinoudakis|first3=Costos|last4=Vimercati|first4=Sabrina di|date=2007-12-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420052183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Communication Anonymity ===
The previously mentioned information anonymity systems can also potentially protect the contents of communications between two people, but there are other systems that directly function to guarantee a communication remains between only two people; they function to accomplish that only the intended recipient of a communication will receive it.&lt;ref&gt;Edman, M. and Yener, B. 2009. On anonymity in an electronic society: A survey of anonymous communication systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 42, 1, Article 5 (December 2009), 35 pages. DOI = 10.1145/1592451.1592456,  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1592451.1592456&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these systems, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] (which is an acronym for ''Pretty Good Privacy''), has existed in various forms for many years. It functions to protect email messages by encrypting and decrypting them. It originally existed as a command-line-only program, but in recent years it has evolved to have its own full interface and a multitude of email providers offer built-in PGP support. Users can also install PGP-compatible software and manually configure it to encrypt emails on nearly any platform.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, Philip R. (1999). "Why I Wrote PGP". Essays on PGP. Philip Zimmermann.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (acronym for Secure Sockets Layer) and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] (acronym for Transport Layer Security) are measures to secure payments online. While these systems are not immune from breaches or failure, many users benefit greatly from their use as every major browser program has support for it built in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Hacking  ==

=== Phishing ===
''Main article: [[Phishing]]''

[[Phishing]] is a common method of obtaining someone's private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-09-15|title=A survey of phishing attacks: Their types, vectors and technical approaches|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418302070|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|language=en|volume=106|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2018.03.050|issn=0957-4174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a [[hacker]]), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Taking the Bait: A Systems Analysis of Phishing Attacks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915001869|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=1109–1116|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.185|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Societal Implications  ==
Digital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, the [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] by [[Eric Berlow]] and Sean Gourley subsequent to the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] cast a shadow over the privacy of [[cloud storage]] and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gourley|first=Eric Berlow and Sean|title=Mapping ideas worth spreading|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_berlow_and_sean_gourley_mapping_ideas_worth_spreading|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While digital privacy is concerned with the [[privacy]] of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning [[personal identity]] shared over public networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/es/issues/privacy|title=Privacy|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-11-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the [[Edward Snowden]] disclosures concerning the extent of the [[NSA]] [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on [[privacy concerns with social networking services]], as viewed from within these services.

As the secrecy of the American [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] becomes widely disclosed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2013/08/22/google-and-microsofts-plea-on-nsa-requests-moves-slowly-in-secret-court/|title=Google and Microsoft’s plea on NSA requests moves slowly in secret court|last=Roberts|first=Jeff|date=2013-08-22|website=gigaom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of [[mass surveillance]].

The use of [[cryptographic software]] to evade [[prosecution]] and [[harassment]] while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with [[crypto-anarchism]], a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32297">'''Durotaxis''' is a form of [[cell migration]] in which cells are guided by rigidity gradients, which arise from differential structural properties of the [[Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix]] (ECM). Most normal cells migrate up rigidity gradients (in the direction of greater stiffness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plotnikov|first1=SV|last2=Pasapera|first2=AM|last3=Sabass|first3=B|last4=Waterman|first4=CM|title=Force fluctuations within focal adhesions mediate ECM-rigidity sensing to guide directed cell migration.|journal=Cell|date=21 December 2012|volume=151|issue=7|pages=1513–27|pmid=23260139|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.034|pmc=3821979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of durotaxis research ==
The process of durotaxis requires a cell to actively sense the environment, process the mechanical stimulus, and execute a response. Originally, this was believed to be an emergent [[metazoa]]n property, as the phenomenon requires a complex sensory loop that is dependent on the communication of many different cells. However, as the wealth of relevant scientific literature grew in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, it became apparent that single cells possess the ability to do the same. The first observations of durotaxis in isolated cells were that mechanical stimuli could cause the initiation and elongation of [[axon]]s in the sensory and brain [[neuron]]s of chicks and induce motility in previously stationary fish epidermal keratocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bray|first1=D|title=Axonal growth in response to experimentally applied mechanical tension.|journal=Developmental Biology|date=April 1984|volume=102|issue=2|pages=379–89|pmid=6706005|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(84)90202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamoureux|first1=P|last2=Buxbaum|first2=RE|last3=Heidemann|first3=SR|title=Direct evidence that growth cones pull.|journal=Nature|date=13 July 1989|volume=340|issue=6229|pages=159–62|pmid=2739738|doi=10.1038/340159a0|bibcode=1989Natur.340..159L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chada|first1=S|last2=Lamoureux|first2=P|last3=Buxbaum|first3=RE|last4=Heidemann|first4=SR|title=Cytomechanics of neurite outgrowth from chick brain neurons.|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=May 1997|volume=110|pages=1179–86|pmid=9191042|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verkhovsky|first1=AB|last2=Svitkina|first2=TM|last3=Borisy|first3=GG|title=Self-polarization and directional motility of cytoplasm.|journal=Current Biology|date=14 January 1999|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|pmid=9889119|doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECM stiffness was also noted to influence [[Cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] stiffness, [[fibronectin]] fibril assembly, the strength of [[integrin]]-cytoskeletal interactions, morphology and motility rate, all of which were known influence cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=N|last2=Butler|first2=JP|last3=Ingber|first3=DE|title=Mechanotransduction across the cell surface and through the cytoskeleton.|journal=Science|date=21 May 1993|volume=260|issue=5111|pages=1124–7|pmid=7684161|doi=10.1126/science.7684161|bibcode=1993Sci...260.1124W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halliday|first1=NL|last2=Tomasek|first2=JJ|title=Mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix influence fibronectin fibril assembly in vitro.|journal=Experimental Cell Research|date=March 1995|volume=217|issue=1|pages=109–17|pmid=7867709|doi=10.1006/excr.1995.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzbauer|first1=JE|last2=Sechler|first2=JL|title=Fibronectin fibrillogenesis: a paradigm for extracellular matrix assembly.|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=October 1999|volume=11|issue=5|pages=622–7|pmid=10508649|doi=10.1016/s0955-0674(99)00017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choquet|first1=D|last2=Felsenfeld|first2=DP|last3=Sheetz|first3=MP|title=Extracellular matrix rigidity causes strengthening of integrin-cytoskeleton linkages.|journal=Cell|date=10 January 1997|volume=88|issue=1|pages=39–48|pmid=9019403|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81856-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelham RJ|first1=Jr|last2=Wang|first2=Yl|title=Cell locomotion and focal adhesions are regulated by substrate flexibility.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=9 December 1997|volume=94|issue=25|pages=13661–5|pmid=9391082|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.25.13661|pmc=28362|bibcode=1997PNAS...9413661P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With information from the previous observations, Lo and colleagues formulated the [[hypothesis]] that individual cells can detect [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] [[stiffness]] by a process of active tactile exploration in which cells exert contractile forces and measure the resulting deformation in the substrate. Supported by their own experiments, this team coined the term "durotaxis" in their paper in the ''[[Biophysical Journal]]'' in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lo|first=C|title=Cell Movement Is Guided by the Rigidity of the Substrate|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=1 July 2000|volume=79|issue=1|pages=144–152|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76279-5|pmid=10866943|pmc=1300921|bibcode=2000BpJ....79..144L}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research supports the previous observations and the principle of durotaxis, with continued evidence for cell migration up rigidity gradients and stiffness-dependent morphological changes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plotnikov|first1=SV|last2=Pasapera|first2=AM|last3=Sabass|first3=B|last4=Waterman|first4=CM|title=Force fluctuations within focal adhesions mediate ECM-rigidity sensing to guide directed cell migration.|journal=Cell|date=21 December 2012|volume=151|issue=7|pages=1513–27|pmid=23260139|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.034|pmc=3821979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engler|first1=AJ|last2=Sen|first2=S|last3=Sweeney|first3=HL|last4=Discher|first4=DE|title=Matrix elasticity directs stem cell lineage specification.|journal=Cell|date=25 August 2006|volume=126|issue=4|pages=677–89|pmid=16923388|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Substrate rigidity ==
The rigidity of the ECM is significantly different across cell types; for example, it ranges from the soft ECM of [[brain tissue]] to that of rigid [[bone]] or the stiff [[cell wall]] of plant cells. This difference in rigidity is a result of the qualitative and quantitative biochemical properties of the ECM or in other words, the concentration and categories of the various macromolecules that form the ECM meshwork. Though the ECM is composed of many intracellularly-synthesized components - including a number of [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs) and fibrous [[proteins]] such as [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], [[collagen]], and [[elastin]] - it is the latter two fibers that are most influential in defining the mechanical properties of the ECM.

Collagen is the fibrous [[protein]] that gives the ECM its [[tensile strength]], or rigidity. [[Elastin]] - as its name suggests - is a highly elastic protein with an important role in tissues that need to return to their original positions after deformation, such as [[skin]], [[blood vessels]], and [[lungs]]. The relative concentrations of these two main determinants, along with other less influential matrix components, determine the rigidity of the ECM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.|first1=Bruce Alberts ... et|title=Molecular biology of the cell|date=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-3218-1|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, collagen concentration has been reported to be correlated to matrix stiffness, both ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]'' (gels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenner|first1=Joseph|last2=Stacer|first2=Amanda C.|last3=Winterroth|first3=Frank|last4=Johnson|first4=Timothy D.|last5=Luker|first5=Kathryn E.|last6=Luker|first6=Gary D.|title=Macroscopic Stiffness of Breast Tumors Predicts Metastasis|journal=Scientific Reports|date=1 July 2014|volume=4|doi=10.1038/srep05512|pmid=24981707|pmc=4076689|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E5512F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willits|first1=Rebecca Kuntz|last2=Skornia|first2=Stacy L.|title=Effect of collagen gel stiffness on neurite extension|journal=Journal of Biomaterials Science, Polymer Edition|date=January 2004|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1521–1531|doi=10.1163/1568562042459698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring rigidity ===
In biological research, the rigidity (or stiffness) is commonly measured using [[Young's modulus]] of elasticity, the ratio of stress to strain along an axis, in [[Pascal (unit)|Pascals]]. Thus, a material with a high Young's modulus is very rigid.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=modulus of elasticity     (Young's modulus), ''E''|file=M03966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most precise and well-established method to measure Young's modulus of a tissue relies on instruments - such as the [[Instron]] load cell device - that directly apply a mechanical load and measure the resulting deformation. Now, the Young's modulus of a tissue can be easily and accurately estimated without excision using a variety of [[elastography]] techniques. These methods induce distortion in the tissue and measure the mechanical properties, usually with [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=E.J.|last2=Novakofski|first2=J.|last3=Jenkins|first3=W.K.|last4=O'Brien|first4=W.D.|title=Young's modulus measurements of soft tissues with application to elasticity imaging|journal=IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control|date=January 1996|volume=43|issue=1|pages=191–194|doi=10.1109/58.484478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's modulus has been repeatedly used to characterize the mechanical properties of many tissues in the human body. The stiffness of animal tissues varies over several orders of magnitude, for example:
* Bovine articular cartilage - 950 kPa &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freed|first1=LE|last2=Langer|first2=R|last3=Martin|first3=I|last4=Pellis|first4=NR|last5=Vunjak-Novakovic|first5=G|title=Tissue engineering of cartilage in space.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=9 December 1997|volume=94|issue=25|pages=13885–90|pmid=9391122|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.25.13885|pmc=28402|bibcode=1997PNAS...9413885F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthesizing varying rigidity ===
Matrices of varying stiffness are commonly engineered for experimental and therapeutic purposes (e.g. collagen matrices for wound healing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruszczak|first1=Z|title=Effect of collagen matrices on dermal wound healing.|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date=28 November 2003|volume=55|issue=12|pages=1595–611|pmid=14623403|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Durotactic gradients are simply made by creating 2-dimensional substrates out of polymer (e.g. [[acrylamide]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachowski|first=D|last2=Cortes|first2=E|last3=Pink|first3=D|last4=Chronopoulos|first4=A|last5=Karim|first5=SA|last6=Morton|first6=JP.|last7=del Rio Hernández|first7=AE|date=2017-05-31|title=Substrate Rigidity Controls Activation and Durotaxis in Pancreatic Stellate Cells|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02689-x|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-02689-x|issn=2045-2322|via=|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.2506L}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[polydimethylsiloxane]]) in which the stiffness is controlled by cross-linking density, which in turn is controlled by cross-linker concentration. The polymer must be coated with a material that the cell can adhere to, such as [[collagen]] or [[fibronectin]]. The gradients themselves are often synthesized as hydrogels using [[Microfluidics|microfluidic]] gradient generators followed by [[photopolymerization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaari|first1=N.|last2=Rajagopalan|first2=P.|last3=Kim|first3=S. K.|last4=Engler|first4=A. J.|last5=Wong|first5=J. Y.|title=Photopolymerization in Microfluidic Gradient Generators: Microscale Control of Substrate Compliance to Manipulate Cell Response|journal=Advanced Materials|date=17 December 2004|volume=16|issue=23–24|pages=2133–2137|doi=10.1002/adma.200400883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advancement to this technique is the use of 3D matrices, which are able to guide cell migration in conditions that are more relatable to the natural three dimensional environment of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadjipanayi|first1=E|last2=Mudera|first2=V|last3=Brown|first3=RA|title=Guiding cell migration in 3D: a collagen matrix with graded directional stiffness.|journal=Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton|date=March 2009|volume=66|issue=3|pages=121–8|pmid=19170223|doi=10.1002/cm.20331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular mechanisms in durotaxis ==
The site of cellular contact with the extracellular matrix is the [[focal adhesion]], a large, dynamic protein complex that connects the [[cytoskeleton]] to the ECM fibers through several organized layers of interacting proteins. Integrins are the outermost proteins and the ones that bind directly to the ECM ligands. However, focal adhesions are quite more than simple anchors - their proteins have many roles in signaling. These proteins, such as [[focal adhesion kinase]] (FAK), [[talin protein|talin]], [[vinculin]], [[paxillin]], and [[α-actinin]], interact with small GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) and other signaling pathways in order to relay even small changes in matrix stiffness and consequently respond with changes in cell shape, actomyosin contractility, and cytoskeletal organization. As a result, these changes can cause a cell to rearrange its cytoskeleton in order to facilitate directional migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=J. L.|last2=Cooke|first2=M. E.|last3=Alliston|first3=T.|title=ECM stiffness primes the TGF  pathway to promote chondrocyte differentiation|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=25 July 2012|volume=23|issue=18|pages=3731–3742|doi=10.1091/mbc.E12-03-0172|pmid=22833566|pmc=3442419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanchanawong|first1=Pakorn|last2=Shtengel|first2=Gleb|last3=Pasapera|first3=Ana M.|last4=Ramko|first4=Ericka B.|last5=Davidson|first5=Michael W.|last6=Hess|first6=Harald F.|last7=Waterman|first7=Clare M.|title=Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions|journal=Nature|date=25 November 2010|volume=468|issue=7323|pages=580–584|doi=10.1038/nature09621|pmid=21107430|pmc=3046339|bibcode=2010Natur.468..580K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cell's cytoskeleton is a constantly fluctuating network of polymers whose organization greatly depends on the physical environment of the cell. At the focal adhesions, a cell exerts a traction force. In other words, it pulls on the ECM. Thus, the cell maintains a mechanical homeostasis between ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension across its focal adhesions. This homeostasis is dynamic, as the focal adhesion complexes are continuously constructed, remodeled, and disassembled. This leads to changes in signal transduction and downstream cellular responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galbraith|first1=CG|last2=Sheetz|first2=MP|title=Forces on adhesive contacts affect cell function.|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=October 1998|volume=10|issue=5|pages=566–71|pmid=9818165|doi=10.1016/s0955-0674(98)80030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell signaling is a product of both the physical and biochemical properties of the ECM and interaction between these two pathways is crucial to understand cellular responses. For example, [[bone morphogenetic protein]] (BMP) - a growth factor - is unable to induce osteogenesis under insufficient cytoskeletal tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=YK|last2=Yu|first2=X|last3=Cohen|first3=DM|last4=Wozniak|first4=MA|last5=Yang|first5=MT|last6=Gao|first6=L|last7=Eyckmans|first7=J|last8=Chen|first8=CS|title=Bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced signaling and osteogenesis is regulated by cell shape, RhoA/ROCK, and cytoskeletal tension.|journal=Stem Cells and Development|date=1 May 2012|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1176–86|pmid=21967638|doi=10.1089/scd.2011.0293|pmc=3328763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of cytoskeletal traction is actomyosin contractility. Increased external stiffness leads to a signal transduction cascade that activates the [[small GTPase]] [[Rho]] and [[Rho-associated kinase]] (ROCK). ROCK, in turn, controls [[myosin]] light chain phosphorylation, an event that triggers myosin ATPase activity and the shortening of actin fibers, causing contraction and pulling on the ECM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riento|first1=K|last2=Ridley|first2=AJ|title=Rocks: multifunctional kinases in cell behaviour.|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=June 2003|volume=4|issue=6|pages=446–56|pmid=12778124|doi=10.1038/nrm1128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the precise pathway that connects ECM stiffness to ROCK activity is unknown, the observation of increased traction in response to increased ECM stiffness is sufficient to explain the phenomenon of durotaxis.  The stronger mechanical feedback would pull the cell towards the stiffer region and cause a bias in directional movement and have other consequences on cytoskeletal and focal adhesion organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lo|first=C|title=Cell Movement Is Guided by the Rigidity of the Substrate|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=1 July 2000|volume=79|issue=1|pages=144–152|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76279-5|pmid=10866943|pmc=1300921|bibcode=2000BpJ....79..144L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, durotaxis must rely on continuous sampling of ECM stiffness over space and time in a process called rigidity mechanosensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janmey|first1=PA|last2=McCulloch|first2=CA|title=Cell mechanics: integrating cell responses to mechanical stimuli.|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|date=2007|volume=9|pages=1–34|pmid=17461730|doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.9.060906.151927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has revealed that individual focal adhesions do not necessarily exert stable traction forces in response to unchanging ECM stiffness. In fact, while some individual focal adhesions may display stable traction forces, others exhibit tugging traction in the manner of a repeated cycle of tugging and release. The properties of focal adhesions - whether stable or tugging - are independent of their neighbors and as such, each focal adhesion acts autonomously. This tugging traction has been shown to be dispensable to other forms of cell migration, such as chemotaxis and haptotaxis, but required for durotaxis. The focal adhesion proteins (FAK/paxillin/vinculin) - and their phosphorylation-dependent interactions as well as their asymetrical  distribution within the cell (i.e. YAP activation and nuclear translocation via stiffness activated pFAK)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachowski|first=D|last2=Cortes|first2=E|last3=Robinson|first3=B|last4=Rice|first4=A|last5=Rombouts|first5=K|last6=del Rio Hernández|first6=AE|date=2017-10-25|title=FAK controls the mechanical activation of YAP, a transcriptional regulator required for durotaxis|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/early/2017/10/25/fj.201700721R|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=|pages=fj.201700721R|doi=10.1096/fj.201700721r|issn=0892-6638|pmid=29070586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - are required in order to exhibit high traction and tugging traction across a wide range of ECM rigidities. Furthermore, a reduction in focal adhesion tension by transferring cells to softer ECM or by inhibiting ROCK results in focal adhesion switching from stable to tugging states. Thus, rigidity mechanosensing allows a cell to sample matrix stiffness at the resolution of focal adhesion spacing within a cell (~1-5μm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plotnikov|first1=SV|last2=Pasapera|first2=AM|last3=Sabass|first3=B|last4=Waterman|first4=CM|title=Force fluctuations within focal adhesions mediate ECM-rigidity sensing to guide directed cell migration.|journal=Cell|date=21 December 2012|volume=151|issue=7|pages=1513–27|pmid=23260139|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.034|pmc=3821979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration of biochemical and mechanical cues may allow fine-tuning of cell migration. However, the physiological reasoning behind durotaxis—and specifically the tendency of cells to migrate up rigidity gradients—is unknown.

== Measuring traction ==
The most prevalent and accurate modern method for measuring the traction forces that cells exert on the substrate relies on traction force microscopy (TFM). The principle behind this method is to measure deformation in the substrate by calculating 2-dimensional displacement of fluorescent beads that are embedded in the matrix. High-resolution TFM allows the analysis of traction forces at much smaller structures, such as focal adhesions, at a spatial resolution of ∼1 μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabass|first1=Benedikt|last2=Gardel|first2=Margaret L.|last3=Waterman|first3=Clare M.|last4=Schwarz|first4=Ulrich S.|title=High Resolution Traction Force Microscopy Based on Experimental and Computational Advances|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=January 2008|volume=94|issue=1|pages=207–220|doi=10.1529/biophysj.107.113670|pmid=17827246|pmc=2134850|bibcode=2008BpJ....94..207S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical significance ==
The role of durotaxis under physiological conditions remains unknown. It may serve a purpose in fine-tuning the movement response of a cell to extracellular biochemical cues, though the relative contribution of durotaxis in a physiological environment where a cell is subject to other taxes (e.g. [[chemotaxis]]) is unknown, and may in fact prove to be wholly dispensable for cell migration ''in vivo''. The phenomenon might also have a role in several disease states that include the stiffening of tissues, as outlined below.

=== Cancer ===
It is a common observation that tumors are stiffer than the surrounding tissue, and even serves as the basis for [[breast cancer]] self-examination. In fact, breast cancer tissue has been reported to be as much as ten times stiffer than normal tissue. Furthermore, a growing and metastasizing tumor involves the cooperation of many different cell types, like [[fibroblasts]] and [[endothelial cells]], that possess different rigidities and could result in local stiffness gradients that guide cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Tsung-Hsien|last2=Chou|first2=Yu-Wei|last3=Chiu|first3=Pei-Hung|last4=Tang|first4=Ming-Jer|last5=Hu|first5=Chun-Wen|last6=Yeh|first6=Ming-Long|title=Validation of the effects of TGF-β1 on tumor recurrence and prognosis through tumor retrieval and cell mechanical properties|journal=Cancer Cell International|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1475-2867-14-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is increasing evidence that durotaxis plays a role in [[cancer]] [[metastasis]].

In [[financial mathematics]], the '''entropic risk measure''' is a [[risk measure]] which depends on the [[risk aversion]] of the user through the [[exponential utility]] function.  It is a possible alternative to other risk measures as [[value-at-risk]] or [[expected shortfall]]. 

It is a theoretically interesting measure because it provides different risk values for different individuals whose attitudes toward risk may differ. However, in practice it would be difficult to use since quantifying the risk aversion for an individual is difficult to do.  The entropic risk measure is the prime example of a [[convex risk measure]] which is not [[Coherent_risk_measure|coherent.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudloff |first=Birgit |last2=Sass |first2=Jorn |last3=Wunderlich |first3=Ralf |date=July 21, 2008 |title=Entropic Risk Constraints for Utility Maximization |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~brudloff/RudloffSassWunderlich08.pdf |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018205712/http://www.princeton.edu/~brudloff/RudloffSassWunderlich08.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the connection to [[utility function]]s, it can be used in [[utility maximization problem]]s.

==Mathematical definition==
The entropic risk measure with the risk aversion parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\rho^{\mathrm{ent}}(X) = \frac{1}{\theta}\log\left(\mathbb{E}[e^{-\theta X}]\right) = \sup_{Q \in \mathcal{M}_1} \left\{E^Q[-X] -\frac{1}{\theta}H(Q|P)\right\} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hans|last1=Föllmer|first2=Alexander|last2=Schied|title=Stochastic finance: an introduction in discrete time|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|edition=2|isbn=978-3-11-018346-7|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H(Q|P) = E\left[\frac{dQ}{dP}\log\frac{dQ}{dP}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relative entropy]] of ''Q'' [[Absolutely continuous#Absolute continuity of measures|&lt;&lt;]] ''P''.&lt;ref name="FS10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Follmer|first=Hans|last2=Schied|first2=Alexander|date=October 8, 2008|title=Convex and Coherent Risk Measures|url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~foellmer/papers/CCRM.pdf|accessdate=July 22, 2010|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance set==
The [[acceptance set]] for the entropic risk measure is the set of payoffs with positive expected utility.  That is
: &lt;math&gt;A = \{X \in L^p(\mathcal{F}): E[u(X)] \geq 0\} = \{X \in L^p(\mathcal{F}): E\left[e^{-\theta X}\right] \leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the exponential utility function.&lt;ref name="FS10" /&gt;

==Dynamic entropic risk measure==
The [[conditional risk measure]] associated with dynamic entropic risk with risk aversion parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{\mathrm{ent}}_t(X) = \frac{1}{\theta}\log\left(\mathbb{E}[e^{-\theta X} | \mathcal{F}_t]\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[time consistent]] risk measure if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is constant through time.&lt;ref name="penner_thesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penner |first=Irina |year=2007 |title=Dynamic convex risk measures: time consistency, prudence, and sustainability |url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/penner.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042923/http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/penner.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Simulation projects intending to simulate [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] have been undertaken for the past 20 years. All of these projects had failed as the simulation results showed central bulges which are huge compared to the disk size.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

==Simulation==
The simulation was undertaken using [[supercomputer]]s which include the [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades supercomputer]], the [[Swiss National Supercomputing Centre]] and the supercomputers at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/09/hatching-the-milky-way.html|title=Hatching the Milky Way|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation used 1.4 million processor-hours of the Pleiades supercomputer.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

It is based on the theory that in the early universe, cold and slow moving dark matter particles clumped together. These dark matter clumps then formed the "scaffolding" around galaxies and galactic clusters. The motions of more than 60 million particles which represented dark matter and galactic gas were simulated for a period of 13 billion years.&lt;ref name=universetoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/88602/the-genesis-of-galaxy-eris/|title=The Genesis of Galaxy Eris…|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software platform ''Gasoline'' was used for the simulation.

==Simulation results==
The Eris simulation is the first successful simulation to have resolved the high-density gas clouds where stars formed.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; The simulation result consisted of a galaxy which is very similar to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Some of the parameters which were similar to Milky Way are stellar content, gas content, kinematic decomposition, brightness profile and the bulge-to-disk ratio.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=742|issue=2|page=76|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/742/2/76|last1=Guedes|first1=Javiera|last2=Callegari|last3=Madau|first3=Piero|last4=Mayer|first4=Lucio|authorlink= |title=Forming Realistic Late-type Spirals in a CDM Universe: The Eris Simulation|class=|year=2011|arxiv = 1103.6030 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...742...76G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
The 60 million particles, which are used in the simulation, are not sufficient to simulate the 200 - 400 billion stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/galaxy_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508093645/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/galaxy_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-05-08 |title=NASA – Galaxy |publisher=[[Nasa.gov]] |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dec16th2008 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/milky-way/how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way/ |title=How Many Stars are in the Milky Way? |publisher=Universe Today |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

The '''extinction risk of global warming''' is the risk of [[species]] becoming [[Extinction|extinct]] due to the [[effects of global warming]]. This may be Earth's [[Mass Extinction|sixth major extinction]], often called the [[Anthropocene]] or [[Holocene extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projections==
The scientific consensus in the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that {{Quotation|"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."
"There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 °C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 °C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."}}

In one study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas, C.D. |author2=Cameron, A. |author3=Green, R.E. |author4=Bakkenes, M. |author5=Beaumont, L.J. |author6=Collingham, Y.C. |author7=Erasmus, B.F.N. |author8=Siqueira, M.F.D. |author9=Grainger, A. |author10= Hannah, L.  | year = 2004 | title = Extinction risk from climate change | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 427 | issue = 6970 | pages = 145–148 | doi= 10.1038/nature02121 | url = http://www.mnp.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/20040108nature.pdf  |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | pmid = 14712274|bibcode = 2004Natur.427..145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction.

[[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] climate change seems set to generate very large numbers of species-level extinctions." On the other hand, Daniel Botkin ''et al.'' state "... global estimates of extinctions due to climate change (Thomas et al. 2004) may have greatly overestimated the probability of extinction..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |date=March 2007 |title=Forecasting the Effects of Global Warming on Biodiversity |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=227–236 |doi=10.1641/B570306 |url=http://www.imv.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2FFiles%2FFiler%2FIMV%2FPublikationer%2FFagartikler%2F2007%2F050307_Botkin_et_al.pdf |archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071201040536/http://www.imv.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2FFiles%2FFiler%2FIMV%2FPublikationer%2FFagartikler%2F2007%2F050307_Botkin_et_al.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2007-11-30 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Lemur-like Ringtail Possum|white lemuroid possum]] was reported to be the first known [[mammal]] species to be driven extinct by man-made [[global warming]]. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of [[North Queensland|northern Queensland]] is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16875 Rumours of possum's death were greatly exaggerated] March 31, 2009 [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the January 4, 2012 ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by [[Mark C. Urban]], an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0106/Climate-change-models-flawed-extinction-rate-likely-higher-than-predicted|title=Climate change models flawed, extinction rate likely higher than predicted|date= January 6, 2012 |publisher=[[csmonitor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the [[background extinction rate]], and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don’t belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

In 2016 the [[Bramble Cay melomys]], which lived on a [[Great Barrier Reef]] island, was reported to probably be the first mammal to become extinct because of sea level rises due to human-made climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2016/06/extinct-bramble-cay-melomys|title=Extinct: Bramble Cay melomys|last=Smith|first=Lauren|date=2016-06-15|website=Australian Geographic|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="742">In mathematics, a '''Γ-object''' of a [[pointed category]] ''C'' is a [[contravariant functor]] from Γ to ''C''.

The basic example is [[Segal#Segal|Segal]]'s{{Disambiguation needed|date=October 2017}} so-called '''Γ-space''', which may be thought of as a generalization of [[simplicial abelian group]] (or simplicial abelian monoid). More precisely, one can define a Gamma space as an O-monoid object in an infinity-category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Remark 2.4.2.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion plays a role in the generalization of [[algebraic K-theory]] that replaces an [[abelian group]] by something [[higher object|higher]].

A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

=== Defining and derived parameters ===
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoid parameters}}

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

'''Gestaltzerfall''' (German for "shape decomposition") refers to a type of [[visual agnosia]] and is a [[Gestalt psychology|psychological]] phenomenon where delays in recognition are observed when a complex shape is stared at for a while as the shape seems to decompose into its constituting parts. With regards to [[kanji]], a study has shown that delays are most significant when the characters are of the same size. When characters to recognize are of different sizes, delays are observed only when they are of different patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8981675 |year=1996 |last1=Ninose |first1=Y |last2=Gyoba |first2=J |title=Delays produced by prolonged viewing in the recognition of Kanji characters: Analysis of the 'Gestaltzerfall' phenomenon |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=227–31 |journal=Shinrigaku kenkyu |doi=10.4992/jjpsy.67.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon was first described and named by C. Faust in 1947 as a symptom of the bilateral region of the [[parieto-occipital sulcus]] after a through and through bullet wound of this region. Afterwards, when the subject stared at a truck for a while the truck seemed to decompose into its motor, chassis, driver cab and the person could only focus on one of these parts until he briefly closed his eyes or looked away which reset the shape to the complete truck again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=C.|title=Über Gestaltzerfall als Symptom des parieto-occipitalen Übergangsgebiets bei doppelseitiger Verletzung nach Hirnschuß|journal=Nervenarzt|date=1947|issue=18|pages=103-115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic of orthographic satiation as opposed to semantic satiation is that meaning remains intact. It was suggested that this is different from semantic satiation and from the stimulus familiarization effect because orthographic satiation occurs after the perceivers have access to lexical meaning.

[[File:Nyquist_grid.svg|thumb|Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;G(s) = 1/(s+0.5)&lt;/math&gt;in blue with M and N circles overlaid in the plot. The M circle with M = 0.45 is highlighted in red and intercepts the Nyquist plot at frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega \approx \pm 1.64&lt;/math&gt;.]]
'''Hall circles''' (also known as M-circles and N-circles) are a graphical tool in [[control theory]] used to obtain values of a [[closed-loop transfer function]] from the [[Nyquist-plot|Nyquist plot]] (or the [[Nichols plot]]) of the associated open-loop transfer function. Hall circles have been introduced in control theory by Albert C. Hall in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857968901|title=The analysis and synthesis of linear servomechanisms|last=C.|first=Hall, Albert|date=1943|publisher=Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=9780262080736|location=Cambridge|oclc=857968901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Consider a closed-loop linear control system with open-loop transfer function given by [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; and with a unit gain in the feedback loop. The closed-loop transfer function is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt; T(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)} &lt;/math&gt;. 

To check the stability of ''T''(''s''), it is possible to use the Nyquist stability criterion with the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function ''G''(''s''). Note, however, that only the Nyquist plot of ''G''(''s'') does not give the actual values of ''T''(''s''). To get this information from the G(s)-plane, Hall proposed to construct the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant magnitude and the also the locus of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant phase angle.

Given a positive real value ''M'' representing a fixed magnitude, and denoting G(s) by ''z'', the points satisfying  &lt;math display="block"&gt; M = |T(s)| = \frac{|G(s)|}{|1+G(s)|} = \frac{|z|}{|1+z|} &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points ''z'' in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the ratio of the distance between ''z'' and 0 and the distance between ''z'' and -1 is equal to ''M''. The points ''z'' satisfying this locus condition are [[circles of Apollonius]], and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''M-circles''.

Given a positive real value ''N'' representing a phase angle, the points satisfying &lt;math display="block"&gt; N = \arg \left[\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}\right] = \arg[G(s)] - \arg[1+G(s)] = \arg[z] - \arg[1+z] &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points z in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the angle between -1 and z and the angle between 0 and z is constant. In other words, the angle opposed to the line segment between -1 and 0 must be constant. This implies that the points z satisfying this locus condition are arcs of circles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/inscribed.shtml|title=Munching on Inscribed Angles|last=|first=|date=|website=cut-the-knot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''N-circles''.

== Usage ==
[[File:Nichols_chart.svg|thumb|Nichols plot of the transfer function 1/s(1+s)(1+2s) along with the modified M and N circles.]]
To use the Hall circles, a plot of M and N circles is done over the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function. The points of the intersection between these graphics give the corresponding value of the closed-loop transfer function.

Hall circles are also used with the [[Nichols plot]] and in this setting, are also known as Nichols chart. Rather than overlaying directly the Hall circles over the Nichols plot, the points of the circles are transferred to a new coordinate system where the ordinate is given by &lt;math&gt; 20 \log_{10}(|G(s)|) &lt;/math&gt; and the abscissa is given by &lt;math&gt; \arg(G(s))&lt;/math&gt;. The advantage of using Nichols chart is that adjusting the gain of the open loop transfer function directly reflects in up and down translation of the Nichols plot in the chart.

A '''house mark''' was originally a mark of property, later also used as a family or clan emblem, incised on the facade of a building, on animals, in signet and similar in the farmer and burgher culture of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The tradition originates with the [[mason's mark]]s used in the [[Middle Ages]].

These marks have the appearance of [[glyph]]s or [[Runic script|runes]] consisting of a pattern of simple lines, without the application of colour.

==Background==
The purpose of a house mark is to have a recognisable mark that a person, a nuclear family, multiple generations of an extended family or an owner of a property can use to mark objects, [[cattle]] or buildings for recognition of ownership. The use of house marks dates back to long before [[writing]] was public knowledge.

Besides farmers, house marks have also been used by [[merchant]]s, [[tradesman]], [[artisan]]s and other town [[Citizen#Middle Ages|burgher]]s on for example [[Bryggen]] in [[Bergen]], on building blocks in the [[Nidaros Cathedral]], and on personal [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] in other Norwegian cities. There are also house marks written by hand on documents, for instance house marks of [[mining]] workers at [[Røros]].

The Norwegian word ''b'''o'''merke'' or ''b'''oe'''merke'' probably came from [[Denmark]]. There is no Norwegian reference before the 17th century. Today ''b'''o'''merke'' is mainly written as ''b'''u'''merke'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Both in Denmark and [[Sweden]], the word bomerke (with multiple spellings) is used since the 14th century and in the 16th century. In the [[Iceland]]ic codes of law from the [[Middle Ages]], one finds the word ''einkunn'' used to denote owner marks used to tag animals. It is likely that this word has also been used in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cappelen-krefting.no/hans/bumerkerinorge.htm Hans Cappelen: ''Bumerker i Norge'' (Oslo 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finnish, the word ''puumerkki'' ("insignia") means a distinguishing mark or sign used by illiterate persons as a replacement of a written signature in official documents.

==Description==
The form of house marks is based on function. They should be easy to cut, scratch or engrave with a knife or similar tool. At the same time, they should be distinctive and easy to remember. House marks differ from the more complicated patterns of a [[coat of arms]] or flags, which include surfaces and solid colors.

House marks can be made from one or two lines and up to quite a complex pattern of line figures. Based on appearance, house marks resemble line figures in [[Petroglyph|rock carving]]s and in early [[writing system]]s. It is unclear how extensively such ancient line figures were used as marks for people or property ownership.

The basic forms of a house mark is often [[runic alphabet|runes]], characters and numbers, stylized figures, international symbols like crosses, stars, and [[astrology|astrological]] or [[astronomy|astronomical]] characters.

One characteristic of house marks is that they may consist of a basic form with addition or deduction of lines. In this way, related people can have marks that resemble each other, but differ by details. This is equivalent to [[cadency]] and adding [[Cadency|brisure]]s as a method to change a coat of arms.

Many house marks are placed in [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]]-shaped frames. We see this in seals, on buildings and on [[Headstone|tombstone]]s, for both farmers and city dwellers in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany|German]] areas, during the 1700s and 1800s. Some of these house mark shields also had color and approached the heraldic coat of arms.

'''Human rights in Dubai''' are based on the Constitution and enacted law, which supposedly promise equitable treatment of all people, regardless of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[nationality]] or [[social status]], per Article 25 of the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates]]. Despite this, [[Freedom House]] has stated: "Extreme forms of self-censorship are widely practiced, particularly regarding issues such as local politics, culture, religion, or any other subject the government deems politically or culturally sensitive.

Article 25 of the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution of the UAE]] provides for the equitable treatment of persons with regard to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], nationality, [[religious beliefs]] or [[social status]]. However, in reality there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with full UAE locals being given preferential treatment when it comes to employment, even though they generally show minimal interest in working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn | The National].

[[Labour force of the United Arab Emirates|Labour injustices in Dubai]] have attracted the attention of various human rights groups, which have tried to persuade the government to become a signatory to two of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s eight core conventions, which allows for the formation of labour unions. The Dubai government, however, denied any kind of labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's accusations were misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |title=UAE to allow construction unions |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions.

The [[BBC]] has reported that "local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end.

In December 2005, the Indian [[consulate]] in Dubai submitted a report to the [[Government of India]] detailing labor problems faced by [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriates]] in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of [[employment contract]]s, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.

Despite protests by Human Rights Watch and several governments, companies allegedly continue to take the passports of workers and refuse to pay promised salaries. These practices have been labeled as "modern slavery" by some organizations.&lt;ref name="slavesofdubai"&gt;[https://www.vice.com/vice-news/the-slaves-of-dubai]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a European national by the name of [[Prosecution of Marte Dalelv|Marte Dalelv]], was arrested and jailed on trumped up charges.

The problem of stateless people (known as [[Bidoon]]) has been around for so many years. Many have languished without proper care, even though many of them are natives of the land.

[[Apostasy]] is a crime [[punishable by death]] in the UAE; in practice this has never been applied. UAE incorporates [[hudud]] crimes of Sharia law into its Penal Code - apostasy being one of them.&lt;ref name=shar&gt;Butti Sultan Butti Ali Al-Muhairi (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381546 The Islamisation of Laws in the UAE: The Case of the Penal Code], Arab Law Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 4 (1996), pp. 350-371&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE's Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty,&lt;ref name=shar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Muhairi (1997), Conclusion to the Series of Articles on the UAE Penal Law.

== Religious freedom ==
{{Details|Freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates}}
Islam is the official religion in Dubai.  A policy of religious toleration allows foreigners to practice their faith in a private residence or official place of worship, or they can petition the government for a land grant and permission to build a religious institution to hold religious services, which may be a slow process.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14017.htm|title=United Arab Emirates|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslim groups are generally allowed to meet and advertise their events, but the law prohibits and punishes proselytizing.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

== Freedom of expression ==
{{Details|Emirates Discussion Forum}}
Human rights groups have expressed concerns about freedom of expression in Dubai, which is often limited by enacted laws or Ministerial edicts in the name of protecting traditional Islamic morality or the image and reputation of Dubai and its leaders.

In 2007, the Dubai government shut down two Pakistani television channels, [[Geo News]] and [[ARY Digital Network|ARY One]].  Their entertainment, but not news and political programming, were eventually permitted to broadcast in Dubai.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"&gt;[http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2007/pr1127.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai Ministry of Culture and Media banned the exhibition of a play, "Kholkhal", just hours before it was scheduled to be performed at the 8th annual Gulf Theater Festival.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt; While journalists can no longer be jailed for doing their job, other legal actions can be taken against them. Several members of the Dubai press remain on a government list as being banned from being published within the Emirate. There is also reportedly a degree of self-censorship that occurs, for fear of governmental sanctions, of certain topics that are critical of government policy, the royal family, or may offend traditional Islamic morality.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt;

In July 2013, a video was uploaded onto [[YouTube]], which depicted a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his [[Keffiyeh|local head gear]], the local driver whips the expatriate and also pushes him around, before other passers-by intervene. A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both the local driver and the person who filmed the video have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/senior-uae-official-arrested-over-driver-attack-509289.html|title=Senior UAE official arrested over driver attack|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013 also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai and its youth in a bad light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/crime/2013/December/crime_December24.xml&amp;section=crime|title=Three held for parody video on Satwa streets|last=Fisher|first=Amira Agarib And Amanda|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot in areas of [[Satwa]], [[Dubai]] and featured gangs learning how to fight each other using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc. Eventually, the US citizen was released; in a later interview with the BBC, the Sheikh of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad mentioned that his treatment was unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/dubai-ruler-speaks-to-bbc-about-uaes-legal-system-syria-and-egypt|title=Dubai Ruler speaks to BBC about UAE’s legal system, Syria and Egypt|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/06/uae-trial-94-activists|title=The UAE's bizarre, political trial of 94 activists|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=David Hearst|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man faces 10 months jail for tweets about trial in UAE|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/world/meast/uae-twitter-jail/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=11 April 2013|author=Ben Brumfield|author2=Caroline Faraj|author3=Saad Abedine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repressive measures were also used against people in order to justify the UAE government's claim that there is an "international plot" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilize the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE and were then given only a few days to leave the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;

In 2006, less than 20% of Emirati women were part of the national labor force.&lt;ref&gt;

The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and [[Sharia law]]. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/11012631/Human-Rights-Watch-warns-expat-women-about-the-UAE.html|title=Human Rights Watch warns expat women about the UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights==
{{Details|LGBT rights in the United Arab Emirates}}
In keeping with traditional Islamic morality, both Federal and Emirate law prohibit [[homosexuality]] and [[cross-dressing]] with punishment ranging from long prison sentences, deportation for foreigners, and the death penalty.  No nightclub exists for LGBT explicitly, but spots exist in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with the details spreading only by word-of-mouth. No political organization is allowed to advocate for LGBT rights.

==Prostitution==
Prostitution, although illegal, exists in Dubai. Research conducted by the American Center for International Policy Studies (AMCIPS) found that Russian and Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, as well as women from other African countries, while Indian prostitutes are part of a well-organised trans-Oceanic prostitution network.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"/&gt; A 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary entitled ''Dubai: Night Secrets'' reported that prostitution in clubs is tolerated by authorities and many foreign women work there by choice.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"&gt;Mimi Chakarova.

==Zero tolerance drug policy==
Drugs found in urine or blood testing count as "possession" under UAE law. Raymond Bingham, BBC's DJ [[Grooverider]], was sentenced to four years in prison after a pair of jeans in his luggage was found to contain just over 2&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana.&lt;ref name=grooverider&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7253514.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radio 1 DJ jailed on drug charge | date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai authorities have been known to stop tourists on layovers at the airport and are now using extremely sensitive electronic detection equipment, including urine and blood screening, to search for traces of illegal substances. Keith Brown, a British national, was arrested on September 17, 2007 after authorities claim to have discovered a speck of cannabis on the bottom of one of his shoes. According to an article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'',&lt;ref name=keithbrown&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512815&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Briton jailed for four years in Dubai after customs find cannabis weighing less than a grain of sugar under his shoe | date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the alleged illegal substance was smaller than a grain of sugar - weighing approximately .003&amp;nbsp;grams. He has also been sentenced to four years in prison. Other tourists and residents have been sentenced to [[Capital punishment|execution]] for selling cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/briton-faces-execution-after-uae-drugs-bust-.html Briton faces execution after UAE drugs bust], Yahoo News&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no reports of anyone being executed in the UAE for solely drug offences, unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia. Another UK citizen, Tracy Wilkinson, was arrested and accused of being a "drugs baroness" in 2005 after authorities found [[codeine]] in her blood.&lt;ref name=tracywilkinson&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/4200952.stm | work=BBC News | first=Tanya | last=Gupta | title=Bad back led to jail torment | date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson has a bad back and received an injection of codeine at a Dubai hospital. She ended up spending two months in a cell where she contracted [[dysentery]], [[Head louse|head lice]] and an infestation of [[flea]]s before she was eventually released on bail. German television producer Cat Le-Huy was arrested in January 2008 for possessing a bottle of the over-the-counter hormone sleep aid [[Melatonin]].&lt;ref name=catlehuy&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tv-executive-faces-jail-in-dubai-for-barely-visible-cannabis-speck-785595.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Amol | last=Rajan | title=TV executive faces jail in Dubai for barely visible cannabis speck | date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities claimed that some dirt in Mr. Le-Huy's luggage was [[hashish]]. A Vancouver resident named Bert Tatham was arrested at Dubai International Airport returning home from [[Afghanistan]] (where he was working with farmers to try to convince them not to grow poppies). The anti-narcotics officer was found to have two dead poppy bulbs and a tiny amount of hashish melted into the seams of one of his trouser pockets.&lt;ref name=bertatham&gt;[http://money.aol.ca/article/uae-canadian-pardoned-2nd-writethru-bgt/101850/ AOL Canada: Canadian jailed in drug case in Dubai is pardoned by ruler of the emirate]&lt;/ref&gt; After spending more than 10 months in prison, he was eventually pardoned by U.A.E. President H.H. [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].

==The 2007 censorship of two Pakistani satellite channels==
On 16 November 2007 [[Dubai Media City|Tecom]] stopped [[broadcast]] of two major [[Pakistan]]i [[satellite]] news channels, uplinked from [[Dubai Media City]], which was initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline "Freedom to Create." The [[Dubai]] [[government]] had ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels [[Geo News]] and [[ARY One World]] on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General [[Pervez Musharraf]]. This was implemented by [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|du]] Samacom disabling their [[Serial digital interface|SDI]] &amp; [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] streams. Later, policy makers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organizations in the media city with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html Gulf News - Pakistani TV channels may move out of Dubai Media City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422054301/http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html |date=2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html Gulf News - Geo TV also plans to move out of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401105222/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html |date=2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11/18/2007%208:27:00%20PM NDTV.com - Geo TV hints at options outside of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220150253/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11%2F18%2F2007%208%3A27%3A00%20PM |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11355">'''Injection locking''' and '''injection pulling''' are the frequency effects that can occur when a [[harmonic oscillator]] is disturbed by a second oscillator operating at a nearby frequency.  When the coupling is strong enough and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second.  This is injection locking.  When the second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture it, the effect is called injection pulling.  Injection locking and pulling effects are observed in numerous types of physical systems, however the terms are most often associated with [[electronic oscillators]] or [[laser resonator]]s.

Injection locking has been used in beneficial and clever ways in the design of early [[television set]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s, allowing the equipment to be synchronized to external signals at a relatively low cost.  Injection locking has also been used in high performance frequency doubling circuits. However, injection locking and pulling, when unintended, can degrade the performance of [[phase locked loop]]s and [[radio frequency|RF]] [[integrated circuit]]s.

==Injection from grandfather clocks to lasers==
Injection pulling and injection locking can be observed in numerous physical systems where pairs of oscillators are coupled together.  Perhaps the first to document these effects was [[Christiaan Huygens]], the inventor of the [[pendulum clock]], who was surprised to note that two pendulum clocks which normally would keep slightly different time nonetheless became perfectly synchronized when hung from a common beam.  Modern researchers have [[odd sympathy|confirmed his suspicion]] that the pendulums were coupled by tiny back-and-forth vibrations in the wooden beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2016-03-huygens-pendulum-synchronization.html - Researchers prove Huygens was right about pendulum synchronization&lt;/ref&gt;  The two clocks became injection locked to a common frequency.

In a modern-day [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] an injection-locking signal may override its low-frequency control voltage, resulting in loss of control.  When intentionally employed, injection locking provides a means to significantly reduce power consumption and possibly reduce [[phase noise]] in comparison to other [[frequency synthesizer]] and [[PLL]] design techniques.  In similar fashion, the frequency output of large lasers can be purified by injection locking them with high accuracy reference lasers (see [[injection seeder]]).

==Injection-locked oscillator==
An '''injection-locked oscillator''' ('''ILO''') is usually based on cross-coupled [[LC circuit|LC]] [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. It has been employed for frequency division &lt;ref&gt;M. Tiebout, "A CMOS direct injection-locked oscillator topology as high-frequency low-power frequency divider," IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 39, pp. 1170-1174, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or jitter reduction in [[PLL]], with the input of pure sinusoidal waveform. It was employed in continuous mode clock and data recovery (CDR) or [[clock recovery]] to perform clock restoration from the aid of either preceding pulse generation circuit to convert non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data to pseudo-return-to-zero (PRZ) format&lt;ref&gt;M. De Matos, J. B. Begueret, H. Lapuyade, D. Belot, L. Escotte, and Y. Deval, "A 0.25um SiGe receiver front-end for 5GHz applications," SBMO/IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Microwave and Optoelectronics 2005, pp. 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; or nonideal retiming circuit residing at the transmitter side to couple the clock signal into the data.&lt;ref&gt;[54]	T. Gabara, "An 0.25 μm CMOS injection locked 5.6 Gbit/s clock and data recovery cell," in Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design 1999, pp. 84 - 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the ILO was employed for burst mode clock recovery scheme.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee and M. Liu, "A 20Gbit/s burst-mode CDR circuit using injection-locking technique," in IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), pp. 46–586, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of ILO is based on the fact that the local oscillation can be locked to the frequency and phase of external injection signal under proper conditions.

==Unwanted injection locking==
High-speed logic signals and their harmonics are potential threats to an oscillator.  The leakage of these and other high frequency signals into an oscillator through a substrate concomitant with an unintended lock is unwanted injection locking.

==Gain by injection locking==
Injection locking can also provide a means of gain at a low power cost in certain applications.

|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Injection (aka frequency) pulling occurs when an interfering frequency source disturbs an oscillator but is unable to injection lock it. The frequency of the oscillator is pulled towards the frequency source as can be seen in the spectrogram. The failure to lock may be due to insufficient coupling, or because the injection source frequency lies outside the locking window of the oscillator.

==Entrainment==
'''Entrainment''' has been used to refer to the process of mode locking of coupled driven oscillators, which is the process whereby two interacting [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems, which have different periods when they function independently, assume a common period. The two oscillators may fall into [[Synchronization|synchrony]], but other phase relationships are also possible.  The system with the greater frequency slows down, and the other speeds up.

Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]], the inventor of the [[pendulum clock]], introduced the concept after he noticed, in 1666, that the pendulums of two clocks mounted on a common board had synchronized, and subsequent experiments duplicated this phenomenon.  He described this effect as "[[odd sympathy]]".  The two pendulum clocks synchronized with their pendulums swinging in opposite directions, 180° [[out of phase]], but in-phase states can also result.  Entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce [[negative feedback]]. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero. In the realm of physics, Huygens' observations are related to [[resonance]] and the [[resonant]] coupling of [[harmonic oscillators]], which also gives rise to [[sympathetic resonance|sympathetic vibrations]].

A 2002 study of Huygens' observations show that an antiphase stable oscillation was somewhat fortuitous, and that there are other possible stable solutions, including a "death state" where a clock stops running, depending on the strength of the coupling between the clocks.&lt;ref&gt;M Bennett, M F Schatz, H Rockwood, andK Wiesenfeld, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 458 (2002) 563-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mode locking between driven oscillators can be easily demonstrated using mechanical [[metronome]]s on a common, easily movable surface.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pantaleone, "Synchronization of Metronomes," American Journal of Physics, vol 70 (2002) 992–1000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-57520822-10391705/watch-the-synchronisation-of-32-metronomes-with-an-explanation-behind-it/ Watch the synchronization of 32 metronomes] CBS News, 2013 Sept 10&lt;/ref&gt; Such mode locking is important for many biological systems including the proper operation of [[Biological pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Ermentrout and J. Rinzel, "Beyond a pacemaker's entrainment limit: phase walk-through," American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, Vol 246 (1984) R102–R106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word entrainment in the modern Physics literature most often refers to the movement of one fluid, or collection of particulates, by another (see [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)]]).  The use of the word to refer to mode locking of non-linear coupled oscillators appears mostly after about 1980, and remains relatively rare in comparison.

A similar coupling phenomenon was characterized in [[hearing aid]]s when the [[adaptive feedback cancellation]] is used. This [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] artifact (entrainment) is observed when correlated input signals are presented to an adaptive feedback canceller.

In recent years, aperiodic entrainment has been identified as an alternative form of entrainment that is of interest in biological rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Mainen, Z. F., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1995) Reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons. Science 268, 1503−1506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mori, T., and Kai, S.

The '''International Day of the Disappeared''', on August 30 of each year, is a day created to draw attention to the fate of individuals imprisoned at places and under poor conditions unknown to their relatives and/or legal representatives. The impulse for the day came from the [[Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared]] ''(Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos,'' or FEDEFAM), a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1981 in [[Costa Rica]] as an association of local and regional groups actively working against [[arbitrary arrest and detention|secret imprisonment]], [[forced disappearance]]s and [[kidnapping|abduction]] in a number of [[Latin America|Latin-American countries]].

Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example [[Amnesty International]] (AI), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, [[raising awareness|increase public awareness]], and to call for donations and volunteers.

Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners.

Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to [[Restoring Family Links|restore and maintain contact with their families]], is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance.   It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies.  

These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead.  Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families.   It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones.  It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2013/08-28-disappeared-missing.htm Families of missing people need better support]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of [[human rights]] as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of [[International Humanitarian Law]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] adopted a [[Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances.

On August 30, 2007, hundreds of [[Philippine]] relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/30/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Day-of-the-Disappeared.php  ITH, Hundreds protest in Philippines against abductions]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2008 the [[International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances]], which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]].

[[File:Kinetic diagram of inclined block.svg|thumb|Free body and kinetic diagrams of an inclined block]]
In [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] a '''kinetic diagram''' is a pictorial device used in analyzing mechanics problems when there is determined to be a net force and/or moment acting on a body. They are related to and often used with [[free body diagram]]s. Similar to a free body diagram they depict a single body with forces and moments acting on it but in contrast they only include the net force and moment rather than all of the forces being considered.

Kinetic diagrams are not required to solve dynamics problems; their use in teaching dynamics is argued against by some&lt;ref name=Role&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10923">'''Legal certainty''' is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct.  Legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].

== Definition ==
The legal system needs to permit those subject to the law to regulate their conduct with certainty and to protect those subject to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of [[individual autonomy]] in national jurisprudence. The degree to which the concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

Legal certainty is an established legal concept both in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal systems]] and [[common law legal systems]]. In the civil law tradition, legal certainty is defined in terms of maximum predictability of officials' behaviour. In the common law tradition, legal certainty is often explained in terms of citizens' ability to organise their affairs in such a way that does not break the law. In both legal traditions, legal certainty is regarded as grounding value for the legality of legislative and administrative measures taken by public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =92–93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule of law ==
The legal philosopher [[Gustav Radbruch]] regarded legal certainty, justice and purposiveness as the three fundamental pillars of [[law]].&lt;ref name="Leawood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leawood|first1=Heather|title=Gustav Radbruch: An Extraordinary Legal Philosopher|journal=Washington University Journal of Law &amp; Policy|date=2000|volume=2|page=489|ref=Leawood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) the concept of the rule of law "first and foremost seeks to emphasize the necessity of establishing a rule-based society in the interest of legal certainty and predictability." At the G8 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in [[Potsdam]] in 2007, the G8 committed to the rule of law as a core principle entailing adherence to the principle of legal certainty.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== England and Europe ==
Most European nations regard legal certainty as a fundamental quality of the legal system and a guiding requirement for the [[rule of law]], although they have differing meanings of the term. 

The concept can be traced through [[English common law]]&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; in that system's recognition that legal certainty requires that laws be made such that people can comply with them.

It also recognised in all European civil legal systems.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page= 454 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is recognised in Germany as ''[[:de:Rechtssicherheit|Rechtssicherheit]]'', in France as ''[[:fr:Sécurité juridique|sécurité juridique]]'', in Spain as ''[[:es:Seguridad juridica|seguridad juridica]]'', in Italy as ''[[:it:Certezza del diritto|certezza del diritto]]'', in the Benelux countries as ''rechtszekerheid'', in Sweden as ''[[:sv:Rättssäkerhet|rättssäkerhet]]'', in Poland as ''[[:pl:Pewność prawa|pewność prawa]]'', and in Finland as ''[[:fi:Oikeusvarmuus|oikeusvarmuus]]''. Legal certainty is now recognised as one of the general principles of [[European community law]] and "requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail".&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; The principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law, requires that:
* laws and decisions must be made public
* laws and decisions must be definite and clear
* the decisions of courts must be regarded as binding
* the [[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]] of laws and decisions must be limited
* legitimate interests and expectations must be protected.&lt;ref name="Maxeiner"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Maxeiner| first = James R.| title = Some realism about legal certainty in globalization of the rule of law| publisher = Houston Journal of International law| date = Fall 2008| url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/193182657.html| accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General principle of European Union law ===
The concept of legal certainty has been recognised as one of the [[general principles of European Union law]] by the [[European Court of Justice]] since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; It is an important [[general principle of international law]] and [[public law]], which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| page = 232 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[European Union law]] the general principle of legal certainty prohibits [[Ex post facto law|''Ex post facto'' laws]], i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example in ''Opel Austria v Council''&lt;ref&gt;''Opel Austria v Council'' [1997] ECR II-39 Case T-115/94&lt;/ref&gt; the European Court of Justice held that [[European Council]] Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; The doctrine of [[legitimate expectation]], which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and [[good faith]], is also a central element of the [[General principles of European Union law#Legal certainty|general principle of legal certainty in European Union law]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 455 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations".&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"/&gt; This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being ''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij'' [1988] ECR 2321 Case 120/86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"/&gt;

The misuse of power test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated." A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is ''Giuffrida v Commission''.&lt;ref&gt;''Giuffrida v Commission'' [1976] ECR 1395 Case 105/75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 456 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt;

=== European human rights law ===
The concept of legal certainty is recognised by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== United States ==
In United States law the principle of legal certainty is phrased as [[fair warning (law)|fair warning]] and the [[void for vagueness]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'' case it was established that in the U.S. the prohibition of [[ex post facto]] laws applies only to criminal cases, not to civil law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3498">In mathematics, '''Serre''' and '''localizing subcategories''' form important classes of [[Subcategory|subcategories]] of an [[abelian category]]. Localizing subcategories are certain Serre subcategories. They are strongly linked to the notion of a [[quotient category]].

== Serre subcategories ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[abelian category]]. A non-empty full [[subcategory]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Serre subcategory'' (or also a ''dense subcategory''), if for every short [[exact sequence]] &lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow
A' \rightarrow A\rightarrow A''\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; the object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the objects &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt; belong to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. In words: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under subobjects, quotient objects
and extensions.

The importance of this notion stems from the fact that kernels of [[exact functor|exact functors]] between abelian categories have this property, and that one can build (for locally small &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;) the [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotient category]] (in the sense of [[Pierre Gabriel|Gabriel]], [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]],
[[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, which has the same objects as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is abelian, and comes with an exact functor (called the quotient functor) &lt;math&gt;T\colon\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; whose kernel is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Localizing subcategories ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be locally small. The Serre subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''localizing'', if the quotient functor
&lt;math&gt;T\colon\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has a
[[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]]
&lt;math&gt;S\colon\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Since then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, as a left adjoint, preserves [[Limit (category theory)|colimits]], each localizing subcategory is closed under colimits. The functor &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt;) is also called the ''localization functor'', and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the ''section functor''. The section functor is [[exact functor|left-exact]] and [[Full and faithful functors|fully faithful]].

If the abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is moreover
[[complete category|cocomplete]] and has [[injective hull|injective hulls]] (e.g. if it is a [[Grothendieck category]]), then a Serre
subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is localizing if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under arbitrary coproducts (a.k.a.
direct sums). Hence the notion of a localizing subcategory is
equivalent to the notion of a hereditary [[Torsion theory|torsion class]].

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; a localizing subcategory, then the quotient category
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is again a Grothendieck category.

The [[Gabriel-Popescu theorem]] implies that every Grothendieck category is the quotient category of a [[category of modules|module category]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a suitable [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]) modulo a localizing subcategory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10092">In [[electromagnetism]], the '''Lorenz gauge condition''' or '''Lorenz gauge''' (sometimes mistakenly called the Lorentz gauge) is a partial [[gauge fixing]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic vector potential]]. The condition is that &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu A^\mu=0.&lt;/math&gt; This does not completely determine the gauge: one can still make a gauge transformation &lt;math&gt;A^\mu\to A^\mu+\partial^\mu f,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[harmonic function|harmonic]] scalar function (that is, a [[scalar function]] satisfying &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\partial^\mu f=0,&lt;/math&gt; the equation of a [[scalar field theory|massless scalar field]]).

The Lorenz condition is used to eliminate the redundant spin-0 component in the {{nowrap|(1/2, 1/2)}} [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]]. It is equally used for massive spin-1 fields where the concept of gauge transformations does not apply at all.

The Lorenz condition is named after [[Ludvig Lorenz]]. It is a [[Lorentz invariant]] condition, and is frequently called the "Lorentz condition" because of confusion with [[Hendrik Lorentz]], after whom Lorentz covariance is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Jackson|first1 = J.D.|author1-link = John David Jackson (physicist)|last2 = Okun|first2 = L.B.|author2-link = Lev Okun|title = Historical roots of gauge invariance|journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume = 73|issue = 3|pages = 663–680|year = 2001|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.73.663|arxiv = hep-ph/0012061|bibcode = 2001RvMP...73..663J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In [[electromagnetism]], the Lorenz condition is generally [[Scientific method|used]] in [[calculation]]s of [[Time-variant system|time-dependent]] [[electromagnetic field]]s through [[retarded potential]]s.&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{Citation |first1=Kirk T. |last1=McDonald|title=The relation between expressions for time-dependent electromagnetic fields given by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1074–1076 |year=1997 |doi=10.1119/1.18723 |bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1074M|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/jefimenko.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu A^\mu \equiv A^\mu{}_{,\mu} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-potential]], the comma denotes a [[partial differentiation]] and the repeated index indicates that the [[Einstein summation convention]] is being used. The condition has the advantage of being [[Lorentz invariant]]. It still leaves substantial gauge degrees of freedom.

In ordinary vector notation and [[SI]] units, the condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{ \vec{A}} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic vector potential]] and &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric potential]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=[[Classical Electrodynamics (book)|Classical Electrodynamics]]|edition=3rd|pages=240|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-30932-X|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v2ck__wFOBEC|title=Quantum Theory of Near-Field Electrodynamics|last=Keller|first=Ole|date=2012-02-02|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642174100|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[gauge fixing]].

In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]] units the condition is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{\vec{A}} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gbur|first=Gregory J.|title=Mathematical Methods for Optical Physics and Engineering|year=2011|pages=59|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51610-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L7w7UpecbKYC|title=The Quantum Theory of Radiation|last=Heitler|first=Walter|date=1954|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=|isbn=9780486645582|location=|pages=3|language=en|author-link=Walter Heitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quick justification of the Lorenz gauge can be found using [[Maxwell's equations]] and the relation between the magnetic vector potential and the magnetic field:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times -\frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\vec{E} + \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the curl is zero, that means there is a scalar function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla\varphi = \vec{E} + \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the well known equation for the electric field, 

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\nabla \varphi - \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be plugged into another one of Maxwell's equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla \times \vec{B} &amp;= \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \vec{A}\right) \\
 &amp;= \nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \vec{A}\right) - \nabla^2\vec{A} \\
 &amp;= \mu_0\vec{J} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t} \\
 &amp;= \mu_0\vec{J} - \frac{1}{c^2}\nabla\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \vec{A}}{\partial t^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This leaves,

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \vec{A} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}\right) = \mu_0\vec{J} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \vec{A}}{\partial t^2} + \nabla^2\vec{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

To have Lorentz invariance, the time derivatives and spatial derivatives must be treated equally (i.e. of the same order). Therefore, it is convenient to choose the Lorenz gauge condition, which gives the result

:&lt;math&gt;\Box\vec{A} = \left[\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^{2}\right]\vec{A} = \mu_0\vec{J}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar procedure with a focus on the electric scalar potential and making the same gauge choice will yield

:&lt;math&gt;\Box\varphi = \left[\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2\right] \varphi = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\rho .&lt;/math&gt;

These are simpler and more symmetric forms of the inhomogeneous [[Maxwell's equations]]. Note that the [[Coulomb gauge]] also fixes the problem of Lorentz invariance, but leaves a coupling term with first-order derivatives.

Here 

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}&lt;/math&gt; 

is the vacuum velocity of light, and &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is the [[d'Alembertian]] operator. These equations are not only valid under vacuum conditions, but also in polarized media,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, M.V.Cheremisin "Riemann-Silberstein representation of the complete Maxwell equations set", http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0310036, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{J}&lt;/math&gt; are source density and circulation density, respectively, of the electromagnetic induction fields &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; calculated as usual from &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; by the equations 

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\nabla\varphi - \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{B} = \nabla\times \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; 

The explicit solutions for &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; – unique, if all quantities vanish sufficiently fast at infinity – are known as [[retarded potential]]s.

==History==
When originally published, Lorenz's work was not received well by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Maxwell had eliminated the Coulomb electrostatic force from his derivation of the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] since he was working in what would nowadays be termed the [[Coulomb gauge]]. The Lorenz gauge hence contradicted Maxwell's original derivation of the EM wave equation by introducing a retardation effect to the Coulomb force and bringing it inside the EM wave equation alongside the time varying [[electric field]], which was introduced in Lorenz's paper "On the identity of the vibrations of light with electrical currents". Lorenz's work was the first [[symmetry|symmetrizing]] shortening of Maxwell's equations after Maxwell himself published his 1865 paper. In 1888, retarded potentials came into general use after [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]]'s experiments on [[electromagnetic wave]]s. In 1895, a further boost to the theory of retarded potentials came after [[J. J. Thomson]]'s interpretation of data for [[electron]]s (after which investigation into [[electrical phenomena]] changed from time-dependent [[electric charge]] and [[electric current]] distributions over to moving [[point charge]]s).&lt;ref name="mcdonald"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6041">A '''Mani Jewel''' ({{CJKV|c=摩尼珠|p=móní zhū|j=mani ju}}) refers to any of various jewels mentioned in [[Buddhist]] literature as either metaphors for several concepts in [[Buddhist philosophy]] or as mythical [[relic]]s. The word ''mani'' is simply [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] for "jewel", so the phrase "Mani Jewel" is in one sense redundant. However, the Mani Jewel metaphors were significantly expanded in Chinese language texts in which it was also called by essentially the same redundant name ''móní zhū'', where the first two characters (摩尼, móní) are the [[Orthographic transcription|transcription]] of ''mani'' and the third character (珠) is its Chinese translation, "jewel". The English phrase "Mani Jewel" is thus in essence a translation of the Chinese term. The use of the Mani Jewel in Buddhist literature includes various magical relics such as the wish-fulfilling [[cintamani]] as well as metaphorical devices to illustrate several ideas such as [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Śūnyatā]].

==Early Literary References==
The Mani Jewel makes its first appearance in the [[Pali]] [[Nikāya]]s where it is mentioned as one of the seven treasures owned by a "wheel-turning king". The Mahasudhassana Sutta in the [[Digha Nikaya]] describes the Mani Jewel as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“It  was  a  beryl,  pure,  excellent,  well-cut 
into  eight  facets,  clear,  bright,  unflawed, 
perfect  in  every  respect. The  luster  of  this 
Jewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana 
round about.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mani Jewel in this text serves as the source of virtue and good governance for the king. Without it he would lose his throne.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Later texts describe the Mani Jewel differently. One version is the [[Cintamani]] or wish-fulfilling jewel. It was said to be originally owned by the God [[Indra]], but it fell to the earth during a war with the [[Asura]]s, allowing whoever possess it to have their wishes granted. Depictions of the [[Bodhisattva]]s [[Ksitigarbha]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]] sometimes show them holding this Cintamani, indicating their ability to fulfill the wishes of sentient beings.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

The Mani Jewel also appears as a water purifying jewel (清水摩尼) where it could be placed in muddy water by traveling monks, causing any cloudiness to settle out leaving the water clear and pure. This version of the jewel is mentioned in the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] where it is used as a metaphor for faith as an agent capable of dispelling uncertainty.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Yet another depiction of the jewel is in the metaphor of [[Indra's net]] which appears in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It describes a net of infinite size with infinite knots, with each knot containing a Mani Jewel with infinite facets. Each individual Mani Jewel reflects every other Mani Jewel in the same way that any individual being or [[phenomenon]] is indistinguishable from the whole or [[noumenon]] due to their fundamental [[Pratītyasamutpāda|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

==In Buddha Nature Sutras==
The [[Lankavatara Sutra]], the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]], and the [[Surangama Sutra]] all used the Mani Jewel as metaphors for [[Buddha-nature]]. In these sutras, a transparent Mani Jewel within us changes colors depending on the conditions around us, representing the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]. The Mani Jewel itself represents each being's Buddha-nature, but because of the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]] of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, a being sees only the various colors emitted by the jewel. These are mistakenly perceived as the defilements rather than the purity of the jewel itself, which is merely reflecting conditions around it. Thus Buddha-nature is not perceived and only the five skandhas are seen, which are then conflated with a sense of self in opposition to the Buddhist idea of [[Anatta|anātman]] or no-self.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

==In Zen==
Later, the Mani Jewel began to appear in texts produced by Zen Buddhists. An early example is found in [[Guifeng Zongmi]]'s work ''Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Transmits the Mind Ground in China'' in which he compares the four contemporary Zen schools: the Northern   School, the Ox Head School, the [[Hongzhou school]] and the [[Heze school]]. He accomplishes this by comparing how each school would interpret the Mani Jewel metaphor used in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment discussed above. According to Guifeng, the Northern School would believe in a fundamentally pure Mani Jewel that must be cleaned to reveal its purity; the Ox Head school would perceive both the color reflections and the Mani Jewel itself as [[Shunyata|empty]]; the Hongzhou school would say that the blackness covering the Mani Jewel is the Jewel itself, and that its purity can never be seen; the Heze School (to which Guifeng belonged) would interpret the black color covering the jewel as an illusion that is in fact just a manifestation of its brightness such that the surface defilements and the purity of the Jewel interpenetrate one another.&lt;ref name=eye1&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|journal=Dharma Eye|pages=12–20|date=March 2015|number=35|month=|title=The 7th Chapter of Shobogenzo Ikka-myoju (One Bright Jewel): Lecture 1|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/dharma/pdf/35e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eihei Dōgen]], a 13th-century Zen monk and founder of the [[Sōtō school]] of Zen Buddhism in Japan, wrote extensively on the Mani Jewel in an essay of his large work the [[Shōbōgenzō]] entitled ''[[Ikka myōju]]'', or ''One Bright Jewel''. The essay primarily comments on the phrase of the [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese monk [[Xuansha Shibei]], who wrote that "the ten-direction world is one bright jewel". His phrase is in turn an adaptation of the earlier writings of Guifeng Zongmi mentioned above.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6146">In [[economic theory]], the '''money pump argument''' is a [[thought experiment]] intended to show that rational behavior requires transitive preferences: If one prefers A to B and B to C, then one should not prefer C to A. Standard economic theory assumes that preferences are transitive.

However, many people have argued that intransitive preferences are quite common, and often observed in real world settings. A cognitive bias is called the [[focusing effect]]: people focus on one characteristic which stands out in order to make decisions In choosing potential mates, candidate A is more beautiful/handsome than candidate B. B is wealthier then C. C is far better attuned on a personal level than A – the hearts meet. Then choices could be intransitive because instead of evaluating the whole package, people focus on one characteristic which distinguishes between two candidates to make decisions.&lt;ref name="HanssonGrüne-Yanoff2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansson|first1=Sven Ove|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|year=2012|title=Preferences|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|editor=Edward N. Zalta|edition=Winter 2012|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/preferences/|at=sec. 1.3 Transitivity|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The last sentence above really should be expanded into a summary of the content of the article referenced, rather than saying "go read this" (that is what we have "See Also" and "External Links" sections for. Such information would definitely be relevant and would improve this page. --&gt;

==Example==
The original example of the Money Pump was published by Davidson, McKinsey and Suppes in 1955. It was based on gambling games. In their example, there are two "tickets", each of which entitles the bearer to play a gambling game once. Any money paid to obtain the ticket does not count towards the stake for the game. An example of the type of tickets available are:

* Ticket A gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 50:50 chance of winning $5.
* Ticket B gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 1:20 chance of winning $100.

McKinsey and Suppes found that most players would rate the ticket with the higher chance of winning (A) as more desirable, but the ticket with the higher prize (B) as more valuable, thus representing intransitive preferences. This would theoretically allow a "money pump" to operate as follows:

* The operator offers the customer a chance to buy ticket B at a fairly negotiated price, P.
* The operator then offers the customer ticket A in exchange for ticket B, on the grounds that they desire it more.
* The operator then offers to buy ticket A back for a fairly negotiated price, P'. Since A is considered less valuable than B, P' should be less than P. But after all these transactions, all that has happened is that (P-P') dollars have been transferred from the customer to the operator in exchange for ultimately nothing.

== Reactions ==
There are many counter-arguments which can be made to this. One of the simplest was made by Cubitt.&lt;ref name="CubitSugden2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cubit|first1=Robin|last2=Sugden|first2=Robert|title=On Money Pumps|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=Amsterdam|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=121–160|doi=10.1006/game.2000.0834|issn=0899-8256}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paper shows that the argument rests on some very strong assumptions and is tautological: to say that X acts as a money pump is no different from saying that X has intransitive preferences, and does not add anything to evidence for or against the existence of intransitive preferences.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A second argument is more fundamental, and this rests on the possibility of [[incomparability]]. This differentiates between choice and preference. Forced to choose between A and B, I may choose A, yet the two may really not be comparable choices, thus we cannot conclude that I must have preferred A to B. See section on ''incommensurabilty''&lt;ref name="Andreou2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreou|first1=Chrisoula|year=2012|title=Dynamic Choice|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|editor=Edward N. Zalta|edition=Fall 2012|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/dynamic-choice/|at=sec. 1.1 Incommensurable Alternatives|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; in article on "Dynamic Choices" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a more detailed discussion. If choices are not comparable, then again the money pump argument fails.
&lt;!-- Again the last sentence above really should be expanded into a summary of the content of the article referenced, rather than saying "go read this" (that is what we have "See Also" and "External Links" sections for. Such information would definitely be relevant and would improve this page. --&gt;

A more complex and sophisticated version of this argument occurs in the context of [[subjective probability]], where it is known as the [[Dutch book]] argument.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} There it is shown that rational behavior involves making choices over bets in such a way that they correspond to subjective probabilities. If someone fails to satisfy this condition (that is, fails to have subjective probabilities), then his preferences over lotteries will be intransitive and he can be made to act as a money pump. Thus the argument is used{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to justify the existence of subjective probabilities as a requirement for rational behavior. Again there are many possible counter-arguments.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Newton revolving orbits.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure&amp;nbsp;2: The radius ''r'' of the green and blue planets are the same, but their [[angular speed]] differs by a factor ''k''. Examples of such orbits are shown in Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 3–5.]]

In [[classical mechanics]], '''Newton's theorem of revolving orbits''' identifies the type of [[central force]] needed to multiply the [[angular speed]] of a particle by a factor ''k'' without affecting its radial motion (Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 2). Newton applied his theorem to understanding the overall rotation of orbits (''[[Precession (astronomy)#Anomalistic precession|apsidal precession]]'', Figure&amp;nbsp;3) that is observed for the [[Moon]] and [[planet]]s. The term "radial motion" signifies the motion towards or away from the center of force, whereas the angular motion is perpendicular to the radial motion.

[[Isaac Newton]] derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', first published in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance ''r'' between the particle and a point fixed in space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing that it was an inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of ''r''. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit.

As noted by astrophysicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] in his 1995 commentary on Newton's ''Principia'', this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 183"&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the theorem has been studied by [[Donald Lynden-Bell]] and collaborators.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_2008" /&gt; Its first exact extension came in 2000 with the work of Mahomed and Vawda.&lt;ref name="mahomed_2000" /&gt;

[[File:Newton revolving orbit e0.6 precession.ogg|thumb|left|300px|Figure&amp;nbsp;3: Planets revolving the Sun follow elliptical (oval) orbits that rotate gradually over time (''apsidal precession''). The [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of this ellipse is exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity, making them nearly circular.

The motion of astronomical bodies has been studied systematically for thousands of years. The stars were observed to rotate uniformly, always maintaining the same relative positions to one another. However, other bodies were observed to ''wander'' against the background of the fixed stars; most such bodies were called [[planet]]s after the Greek word "πλανήτοι" (''planētoi'') for "wanderers". Although they generally move in the same direction along a path across the sky (the [[ecliptic]]), individual planets sometimes reverse their direction briefly, exhibiting [[retrograde motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To describe this forward-and-backward motion, [[Apollonius of Perga]] ({{nowrap|c. 262 – c. 190 BC}}&lt;!--or 280 BC – c. 210 BC from the Cambridge Encyclopedia 2005--&gt;) developed the concept of [[deferent and epicycle|deferents and epicycles]], according to which the planets are carried on rotating circles that are themselves carried on other rotating circles, and so on. Any orbit can be described with a sufficient number of judiciously chosen epicycles, since this approach corresponds to a modern [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name="sugon_2008"&gt;Sugon QM, Bragais S, McNamara DJ (2008) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2708v1 Copernicus’s epicycles from Newton’s gravitational force law via linear perturbation theory in geometric algebra].&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 350 years later, [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] published his ''[[Almagest]]'', in which he developed this system to match the best astronomical observations of his era. To explain the epicycles, Ptolemy adopted the [[geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmology of [[Aristotle]], according to which planets were confined to concentric rotating spheres. This model of the [[universe]] was authoritative for nearly 1500 years.

The modern understanding of planetary motion arose from the combined efforts of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and physicist [[Johannes Kepler]] in the 16th century. Tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions, from which Kepler was able to derive his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].&lt;ref name=Heilbron11&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbron|2005|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these laws, planets move on [[ellipse]]s (not [[epicycles]]) about the [[Sun]] (not the Earth). Kepler's second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions: planets sweep out equal areas in equal time, and the square of their [[orbital period]]s equals a fixed constant times the cube of their [[semi-major axis]].&lt;ref name=Fitzpartrick41&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzpartrick|2012|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent observations of the planetary orbits showed that the long axis of the ellipse (the so-called ''line of apsides'') rotates gradually with time; this rotation is known as ''apsidal precession''. The [[apsis|apses]] of an orbit are the points at which the orbiting body is closest or furthest away from the attracting center; for planets orbiting the Sun, the apses correspond to the perihelion (closest) and aphelion (furthest).&lt;ref name=Lambourne204&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambourne|2010|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' roughly eighty years later (1687), [[Isaac Newton]] provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on [[Newton's laws of motion]] and his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a [[central force]] ''F''(''r'') that varied as the [[inverse-square law|inverse square]] of the distance ''r'' between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a [[conic section]], specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the [[two-body problem]]); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]]) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton,&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, pp. 339–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundman_1912"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Karl F. Sundman|author= Sundman KF| year = 1912| title = Memoire sur le probleme de trois corps| journal = Acta Mathematica| volume = 36| issue = 1| pages = 105–179| doi = 10.1007/BF02422379}}&lt;/ref&gt; although solutions to a few [[Euler's three-body problem|special cases]] were discovered.&lt;ref name="hiltebeitel_1911"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hiltebeitel AM| year = 1911| title = On the Problem of Two Fixed Centres and Certain of its Generalizations| journal = American Journal of Mathematics| volume = 33| pages = 337–362| doi = 10.2307/2369997| issue = 1/4| publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press| jstor = 2369997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to [[orders of approximation|first approximation]], the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the [[Moon]] about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.&lt;ref name=Heilbron139&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbron|2005|pp=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's theorem of revolving orbits was his first attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively. According to this theorem, the addition of a particular type of central force—the inverse-cube force—can produce a rotating orbit; the angular speed is multiplied by a factor ''k'', whereas the radial motion is left unchanged. However, this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant; several perturbing inverse-square interactions (such as those of other planets) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse-cube force. To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces, Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force ''F''(''r'') to an inverse-cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits, that is, elliptical orbits of low eccentricity, as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System. To find this approximation, Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the [[Taylor expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of precession for arbitrary central forces. Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. However, the problem of the Moon's motion is dauntingly complex, and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon's apsidal precession. After a more accurate model by [[Alexis Claude Clairaut|Clairaut]] in 1747,&lt;ref name="clairaut_1747" &gt;{{cite journal| last = Clairaut| first = AC| authorlink = Alexis Clairaut| year = 1745| title = Du Système du Monde dans les principes de la gravitation universelle| journal = Histoire de l'Académie royale des sciences avec les mémoires de mathématique et de physique| volume = 1749| pages = 329–364| url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-3543&amp;M=chemindefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; analytical models of the Moon's motion were developed in the late 19th century by [[George William Hill|Hill]],&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[George William Hill|Hill GW]]| year = 1894| title = Literal expression for the motion of the moon's perigee| journal = Ann.

However, Newton's theorem is more general than merely explaining apsidal precession. It describes the effects of adding an inverse-cube force to any central force ''F''(''r''), not only to inverse-square forces such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Coulomb's law]]. Newton's theorem simplifies orbital problems in [[classical mechanics]] by eliminating inverse-cube forces from consideration. The radial and angular motions, ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), can be calculated without the inverse-cube force; afterwards, its effect can be calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the particle

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{2} = \frac{d\theta_{2}}{dt} = k \frac{d\theta_{1}}{dt} = k \omega_{1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a particle moving under an arbitrary [[central force]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') whose magnitude depends only on the distance ''r'' between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of a particle under a central force always lies in a plane, the position of the particle can be described by [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure&amp;nbsp;1). Both of these coordinates, ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), change with time ''t'' as the particle moves.

Imagine a second particle with the same mass ''m'' and with the same radial motion ''r''(''t''), but one whose angular speed is ''k'' times faster than that of the first particle. In other words, the [[azimuthal angle]]s of the two particles are related by the equation ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''k&amp;nbsp;θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Newton showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by adding an inverse-cube central force to whatever force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') acts on the first particle&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', section IX of Book I, Propositions 43–45, pp. 135–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r) - F_1(r) = \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the first particle's [[angular momentum]], which is a [[constant of motion]] (conserved) for central forces.

If ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than one, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a negative number; thus, the added inverse-cube force is ''attractive'', as observed in the green planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;1–4 and 9. By contrast, if ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is less than one, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is ''repulsive'', as observed in the green planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures&amp;nbsp;4 and 5.

===Alteration of the particle path===
The addition of such an inverse-cube force also changes the ''path'' followed by the particle. The path of the particle ignores the time dependencies of the radial and angular motions, such as ''r''(''t'') and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''); rather, it relates the radius and angle variables to one another. For this purpose, the angle variable is unrestricted and can increase indefinitely as the particle revolves around the central point multiple times. For example, if the particle revolves twice about the central point and returns to its starting position, its final angle is not the same as its initial angle; rather, it has increased by {{nowrap|2×360° {{=}} 720°}}. Formally, the angle variable is defined as the integral of the angular speed

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_1 \equiv \int \omega_1(t)\, dt.
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar definition holds for ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the angle of the second particle.

If the path of the first particle is described in the form {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''g''(''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the path of the second particle is given by the function {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'')}}, since {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For example, let the path of the first particle be an [[ellipse]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A + B \cos \theta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''B'' are constants; then, the path of the second particle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A + B \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{k} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Orbital precession==
If ''k'' is close, but not equal, to one, the second orbit resembles the first, but revolves gradually about the center of force; this is known as [[precession (astronomy)#Anomalistic precession|orbital precession]] (Figure&amp;nbsp;3). If ''k'' is greater than one, the orbit precesses in the same direction as the orbit (Figure&amp;nbsp;3); if ''k'' is less than one, the orbit precesses in the opposite direction.

Although the orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;3 may seem to rotate uniformly, i.e., at a constant angular speed, this is true only for circular orbits.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lynden-Bell D, Jin S| year = 2008| title = Analytic central orbits and their transformation group| journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]| volume = 386| issue = 1| pages = 245–260| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13018.x| bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..245L|arxiv = 0711.3491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the orbit rotates at an angular speed ''Ω'', the angular speed of the second particle is faster or slower than that of the first particle by ''Ω''; in other words, the angular speeds would satisfy the equation {{nowrap|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Ω}}. However, Newton's theorem of revolving orbits states that the angular speeds are related by multiplication: {{nowrap|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''kω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''k'' is a constant. Combining these two equations shows that the angular speed of the precession equals {{nowrap|''Ω'' {{=}} (''k'' − 1)''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Hence, ''Ω'' is constant only if ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant. According to the conservation of angular momentum, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; changes with the radius ''r''

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{1} = \frac{L_{1}}{m r^{2}};
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the first particle's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]], respectively, both of which are constant. Hence, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant only if the radius ''r'' is constant, i.e., when the orbit is a circle. However, in that case, the orbit does not change as it precesses.

==Illustrative example: Cotes's spirals==
[[File:Impact parameter straight line.svg|thumb|right|Figure&amp;nbsp;6: For the blue particle moving in a straight line, the radius ''r'' from a given center varies with angle according to the equation {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''r'' cos(θ − ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where ''b'' is the distance of closest approach ([[impact parameter]], shown in red).]]

The simplest illustration of Newton's theorem occurs when there is no initial force, i.e., ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') = 0. In this case, the first particle is stationary or travels in a straight line. If it travels in a straight line that does not pass through the origin (blue line in Figure&amp;nbsp;6) the equation for such a line may be written in the polar coordinates (''r'', ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cos\ (\theta_1 - \theta_0)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle at which the distance is minimized (Figure&amp;nbsp;6). The distance ''r'' begins at infinity (when ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −90°}}), and decreases gradually until ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0°}}, when the distance reaches a minimum, then gradually increases again to infinity at ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 90°}}. The minimum distance ''b'' is the [[impact parameter]], which is defined as the length of the perpendicular from the fixed center to the line of motion. The same radial motion is possible when an inverse-cube central force is added.

[[File:Epi half spirals.svg|thumb|left|150px|Figure 7: Epispirals corresponding to ''k'' equal to 2/3 (red), 1.0 (black), 1.5 (green), 3.0 (cyan) and 6.0 (blue). When ''k'' is less than one, the inverse-cube force is repulsive, whereas when ''k'' is greater than one, the force is attractive.]]

An inverse-cube central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') has the form

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r) = \frac{\mu}{r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerator μ may be positive (repulsive) or negative (attractive). If such an inverse-cube force is introduced, Newton's theorem says that the corresponding solutions have a shape called [[Cotes's spiral]]s{{clarify|date=October 2016}}. These are curves defined by the equation&lt;ref name=Grossman139&gt;{{Harvnb|Grossman|1996|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shikin139&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikin|1995|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cos\ \left(\frac{\theta_2 - \theta_0}{k} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''k'' equals

:&lt;math&gt;
k^2 = 1 - \frac{m \mu}{L_1^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the right-hand side of the equation is a positive [[real number]], the solution corresponds to an [[epispiral]].&lt;ref name=Lawrence192&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1972|pp=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the argument ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equals ±90°×''k'', the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when ''k'' is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure&amp;nbsp;7). On the other hand, when ''k'' is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure&amp;nbsp;7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter ''k'' may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ &lt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''), as illustrated in Figure&amp;nbsp;7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.

[[File:Poinsot half spirals.svg|thumb|left|150px|Figure 8: [[Poinsot's spirals|Poinsot spirals]] ([[hyperbolic cosine|cosh]] spirals) corresponding to λ equal to 1.0 (green), 3.0 (cyan) and 6.0 (blue).]]

One of the other solution types is given in terms of the [[hyperbolic cosine]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \cosh\ \left(\frac{\theta_0 - \theta_2}{\lambda} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant λ satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda^2 = \frac{m \mu}{L_1^{2}} - 1
&lt;/math&gt;

This form of Cotes's spirals corresponds to one of the two [[Poinsot's spirals]] (Figure&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref name=Lawrence192/&gt; The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ greater than the positive number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m''. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that ''L'' is not too large for the given μ.

Taking the limit of ''k'' or λ going to zero yields the third form of a Cotes's spiral, the so-called ''reciprocal spiral'' or ''[[hyperbolic spiral]]'', as a solution&lt;ref name="Weisstein1427"&gt;{{Harvnb|Weisstein|2002|pp=1427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = A \theta_2 + \varepsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''ε'' are arbitrary constants. Such curves result when the strength μ of the repulsive force exactly balances the angular momentum-mass term

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{L_{1}^{2}}{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Closed orbits and inverse-cube central forces==
[[File:Newton revolving orbits 1 2 3 6.svg|thumb|170px|right|Figure&amp;nbsp;9: Harmonic orbits with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} (blue), 2 (magenta) and 3 (green). An animation of the blue and green orbits is shown in Figure&amp;nbsp;4.]]

Two types of [[central force]]s—those that increase linearly with distance, ''F = Cr'', such as [[Hooke's law]], and inverse-square forces, {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}} ''C''/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Coulomb's law]]—have a very unusual property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, the path of a bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by [[Bertrand's theorem]], this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.

However, Newton's theorem shows that an inverse-cubic force may be applied to a particle moving under a linear or inverse-square force such that its [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] remains closed, provided that ''k'' equals a [[rational number]]. (A number is called "rational" if it can be written as a fraction ''m''/''n'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are integers.) In such cases, the addition of the inverse-cubic force causes the particle to complete ''m'' rotations about the center of force in the same time that the original particle completes ''n'' rotations. This method for producing closed orbits does not violate Bertrand's theorem, because the added inverse-cubic force depends on the initial velocity of the particle.

[[File:Newton revolving orbits 1 inv2 inv3.svg|thumb|right|170px|Figure&amp;nbsp;10: Subharmonic orbits with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} (blue), 1/2 (magenta) and 1/3 (green). An animation of the blue and green orbits is shown in Figure&amp;nbsp;5.]]

Harmonic and subharmonic orbits are special types of such closed orbits. A closed trajectory is called a ''harmonic orbit'' if ''k'' is an integer, i.e., if {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1}} in the formula {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ''m''/''n''}}. For example, if {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 3}} (green planet in Figures&amp;nbsp;1 and 4, green orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;9), the resulting orbit is the third harmonic of the original orbit. Conversely, the closed trajectory is called a ''subharmonic orbit'' if ''k'' is the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of an integer, i.e., if {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 1}} in the formula {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ''m''/''n''}}. For example, if {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1/3}} (green planet in Figure&amp;nbsp;5, green orbit in Figure&amp;nbsp;10), the resulting orbit is called the third subharmonic of the original orbit. Although such orbits are unlikely to occur in nature, they are helpful for illustrating Newton's theorem.&lt;ref name="lynden_bell_1997"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Lynden-Bell| first = D|author2=Lynden-Bell RM | year = 1997| title = On the Shapes of Newton's Revolving Orbits| journal = Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London| volume = 51| issue = 2| pages = 195–198| doi = 10.1098/rsnr.1997.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limit of nearly circular orbits==
In Proposition 45 of his ''Principia'', Newton applies his theorem of revolving orbits to develop a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets.&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192/&gt; [[Johannes Kepler]] had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis is defined as the line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two [[apsis|apses]]. For illustration, the long axis of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally no more than a few degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, [[Oblate spheroid|oblateness in the attracting body]], [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|general relativistic effects]], and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997"/&gt;

Newton's theorem describes only the effects of adding an inverse-cube central force. However, Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces ''F''(''r'') by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low [[orbital eccentricity]] (''ε''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0.1), which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the [[Solar System|solar system]]. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury,&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Book III, Proposition 2, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; which has an eccentricity ''ε ''of roughly 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to [[Halley's comet]], whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0.97.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997" /&gt;

A qualitative justification for this extrapolation of his method has been suggested by Valluri, Wilson and Harper.&lt;ref name="valluri_1997" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valluri S. R. |author2=Wilson C. |author3=Harper W. | year = 1997| title = Newton's Apsidal Precession Theorem and Eccentric Orbits| journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy| volume = 28| pages = 13–27| bibcode = 1997JHA....28...13V | doi=10.1177/002182869702800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a [[smooth function|smooth]], [[continuous function]] of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that the force of gravity is an inverse-square law.

===Quantitative formula===
To simplify the equations, Newton writes ''F''(''r'') in terms of a new function ''C''(''r'')

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = \frac{C(r)}{R r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the average radius of the nearly circular orbit. Newton expands ''C''(''r'') in a series—now known as a [[Taylor expansion]]—in [[power series|powers]] of the distance ''r'', one of the first appearances of such a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Cohen IB| year = 1990| chapter = Halley's Two Essays on Newton's ''Principia''| title = Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: A Longer View of Newton and Halley| editor = Norman Thrower, editor| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley, CA| isbn = 978-0-520-06589-5| pages = 91–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; By equating the resulting inverse-cube force term with the inverse-cube force for revolving orbits, Newton derives an equivalent angular scaling factor ''k'' for nearly circular orbits：&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar S|1995|pp=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \left( \frac{R}{C} \right) \left. \frac{dC}{dr} \right|_{r=R}
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the application of an arbitrary central force ''F''(''r'') to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate the angular motion by the factor ''k'' without affecting the radial motion significantly. If an elliptical orbit is stationary, the particle rotates about the center of force by 180° as it moves from one end of the long axis to the other (the two [[apse]]s). Thus, the corresponding apsidal angle ''α'' for a general central force equals ''k''×180°, using the general law {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Examples===
Newton illustrates his formula with three examples. In the first two, the central force is a [[power law]], {{nowrap|''F''(''r'') {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and, hence,''C''(''r'') is proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The formula above indicates that the angular motion is multiplied by a factor {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1/{{radic|''n''}}}}, so that the apsidal angle ''α'' equals 180°/{{radic|''n''}}.

This angular scaling can be seen in the apsidal precession, i.e., in the gradual rotation of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure&amp;nbsp;3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed ''Ω''=(''k''−1)''ω'', where ''ω'' equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time ''T'' to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Ω''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''ωT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)×180°. For an [[inverse-square law]] such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], where ''n'' equals 1, there is no angular scaling (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), the apsidal angle ''α'' is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).

As a final illustration, Newton considers a sum of two power laws

:&lt;math&gt;
C(r) \propto a r^m + b r^n
&lt;/math&gt;

which multiplies the angular speed by a factor

:&lt;math&gt;
k = \sqrt{\frac{a + b}{am + bn}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Newton applies both of these formulae (the power law and sum of two power laws) to examine the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit.

==Precession of the Moon's orbit==
[[File:Lunar libration with phase2.gif|thumb|350px|right|The Moon's motion is more complex than those of the planets, mainly due to the competing gravitational pulls of the Earth and the Sun.]]

The motion of the [[Moon]] can be measured accurately, and is noticeably more complex than that of the planets.&lt;ref name="cook_2000"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cook A| year = 2000| title = Success and Failure in Newton's Lunar Theory| journal = Astronomy and Geophysics| volume = 41| pages = 21–25| bibcode = 2000A&amp;G....41f..21C| doi = 10.1046/j.1468-4004.2000.41621.x| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek astronomers, [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]], had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit,&lt;ref name="cook_2000" /&gt; such as small oscillations in its [[orbital eccentricity]] and the [[inclination]] of its orbit to the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its [[apsis|apses]] precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its [[Longitude of the ascending node|line of nodes]] turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of [[eclipse]]s, the so-called [[Saros cycle]]. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.

In 1673, [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] published a reasonably accurate model of the Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit.&lt;ref name="horrocks_1673"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Jeremiah Horrocks|Horrocks J]]| year = 1673| title = Jeremia Horocii opera posthuma| publisher = G Godbit for J Martyn| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Wilson C| year = 1987| title = On the Origin of Horrock's Lunar Theory| journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy| volume = 18| pages = 77–94|bibcode = 1987JHA....18...77W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's [[longitude]];&lt;ref name="kollerstrom_2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kollerstrom N| year = 2000| title = Newton's Forgotten Lunar Theory: His Contribution to the Quest for Longitude| publisher = Green Lion Press| isbn = 978-1-888009-08-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Newton's time, the goal was to predict the Moon's position to 2' (two [[minute of arc|arc-minutes]]), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude.&lt;ref name="smith_254" &gt;Smith, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes;&lt;ref name="smith_254" /&gt; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.

Newton used his theorem of revolving orbits in two ways to account for the apsidal precession of the Moon.&lt;ref name="newton_45" &gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Book I, Section IX, Proposition 45, pp. 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; First, he showed that the Moon's observed apsidal precession could be accounted for by changing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|force law of gravity]] from an inverse-square law to a [[power law]] in which the exponent was {{nowrap|2 + 4/243}} (roughly 2.0165)&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = - \frac{GMm}{r^{2 + 4/243}}
&lt;/math&gt;

In 1894, [[Asaph Hall]] adopted this approach of modifying the exponent in the inverse-square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital [[precession]] of the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]],&lt;ref name="hall_1894" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Hall A| year = 1894| title = A suggestion in the theory of Mercury| journal = The Astronomical Journal| volume = 14| pages = 49–51| doi = 10.1086/102055| bibcode=1894AJ.....14...49H}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been observed in 1859 by [[Urbain Le Verrier]].&lt;ref name="le_verrier" &gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier UJJ]]| year = 1859| title = Théorie du mouvement de Mercure| journal = Annales de l'Observatoire Impérial de Paris| volume = 5| pages = 1–196, esp. 98–106| bibcode = 1859AnPar...5....1L}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Simon Newcomb]]| title = Discussion and Results of Observations on Transits of Mercury from 1677 to 1881| journal = Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac| volume = 1| page = 473| bibcode = 1882USNAO...1..363N| year = 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Hall's theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of the Moon.&lt;ref name="brown_1903" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Brown EW| year = 1903| title = On the degree of accuracy in the new lunary theory| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 64| pages = 524–534 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/64.6.524 |bibcode = 1904MNRAS..64..524. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|currently accepted explanation]] for this precession involves the theory of [[general relativity]], which (to [[Orders of approximation|first approximation]]) adds an inverse-quartic force, i.e., one that varies as the inverse fourth power of distance.&lt;ref name="roseveare_1982"&gt;{{cite book| author = Roseveare N| year = 1982| title = Mercury's perihelion from Le verrier to Einstein| publisher = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a second approach to explaining the Moon's precession, Newton suggested that the perturbing influence of the [[Sun]] on the Moon's motion might be approximately equivalent to an additional linear force

:&lt;math&gt;
F(r) = \frac{A}{r^{2}} + B r
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term corresponds to the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the Earth, where ''r'' is the Moon's distance from the Earth. The second term, so Newton reasoned, might represent the average perturbing force of the Sun's gravity of the Earth-Moon system. Such a force law could also result if the Earth were surrounded by a spherical dust cloud of uniform density.&lt;ref name="symon_1971"&gt;{{cite book| author = Symon KR| year = 1971| title = Mechanics| edition = 3rd| publisher = Addison–Wesley| location = Reading, MA| isbn = 0-201-07392-7| pages = 267 (Chapter 6, problem 7)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the formula for ''k'' for nearly circular orbits, and estimates of ''A'' and ''B'', Newton showed that this force law could not account for the Moon's precession, since the predicted apsidal angle ''α'' was (≈&amp;nbsp;180.76°)  rather than the observed α (≈&amp;nbsp;181.525°).  For every revolution, the long axis would rotate 1.5°,  roughly half of the observed 3.0°&lt;ref name="newton_45" /&gt;

==Generalization==
[[Isaac Newton]] first published his theorem in 1687, as Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. However, as astrophysicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] noted in his 1995 commentary on Newton's ''Principia'', the theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 183"/&gt;

The first generalization of Newton's theorem was discovered by Mahomed and Vawda in 2000.&lt;ref name="mahomed_2000" &gt;{{cite journal| author = Mahomed FM, Vawda F| year = 2000| title = Application of Symmetries to Central Force Problems| journal = [[Nonlinear Dynamics (journal)|Nonlinear Dynamics]] | volume = 21| issue = 4| pages = 307–315| doi = 10.1023/A:1008317327402}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Newton did, they assumed that the angular motion of the second particle was ''k'' times faster than that of the first particle, {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In contrast to Newton, however, Mahomed and Vawda did not require that the radial motion of the two particles be the same, {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Rather, they required that the inverse radii be related by a linear equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r_{2}(t)} = \frac{a}{r_{1}(t)} + b
&lt;/math&gt;

This transformation of the variables changes the path of the particle. If the path of the first particle is written {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the second particle's path can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a r_2}{1 - b r_2} = g\left( \frac{\theta_2}{k} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

If the motion of the first particle is produced by a central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''), Mahomed and Vawda showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by the following force

:&lt;math&gt;
F_2(r_2) = \frac{a^3}{\left( 1 - b r_2 \right)^2} F_{1}\left( \frac{a r_2}{1 - b r_2} \right) +
\frac{L^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right) - \frac{bL^2}{mr^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

According to this equation, the second force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') is obtained by scaling the first force and changing its argument, as well as by adding inverse-square and inverse-cube central forces.

For comparison, Newton's theorem of revolving orbits corresponds to the case {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 1}} and {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} 0}}, so that {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In this case, the original force is not scaled, and its argument is unchanged; the inverse-cube force is added, but the inverse-square term is not. Also, the path of the second particle is {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''g''(θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'')}}, consistent with the formula given above.

==Derivations==

===Newton's derivation===
Newton's derivation is found in Section IX of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', specifically Propositions 43–45.&lt;ref name="newton_derivation"&gt;Chandrasekhar, pp. 183–192.&lt;/ref&gt; His derivations of these Propositions are based largely on geometry.

; Proposition 43; Problem 30

[[File:Newton revolving orbit diagram.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram illustrating Newton's derivation. The blue planet follows the dashed elliptical orbit, whereas the green planet follows the solid elliptical orbit; the two ellipses share a common [[focus (geometry)|focus]] at the point '''C'''. The angles UCP and VCQ both equal ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the black arc represents the angle UCQ, which equals {{nowrap|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The solid ellipse has rotated relative to the dashed ellipse by the angle UCV, which equals (''k''&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. All three planets (red, blue and green) are at the same distance ''r'' from the center of force '''C'''.]]

:''It is required to make a body move in a curve that revolves about the center of force in the same manner as another body in the same curve at rest.''&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 184"&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's derivation of Proposition 43 depends on his Proposition 2, derived earlier in the ''Principia''.&lt;ref name="areal_law"&gt;Chandrasekhar, pp. 67–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a [[central force]]. Newton showed that a force is central if and only if the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.

Newton's derivation begins with a particle moving under an arbitrary central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''); the motion of this particle under this force is described by its radius ''r''(''t'') from the center as a function of time, and also its angle θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). In an infinitesimal time ''dt'', the particle sweeps out an approximate right triangle whose area is

:&lt;math&gt;
dA_1 = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the force acting on the particle is assumed to be a central force, the particle sweeps out equal angles in equal times, by Newton's Proposition 2. Expressed another way, the ''rate'' of sweeping out area is constant

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dA_1}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = \mathrm{constant}
&lt;/math&gt;

This constant ''areal velocity'' can be calculated as follows. At the [[apsis|apapsis and periapsis]], the positions of closest and furthest distance from the attracting center, the velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular; therefore, the [[angular momentum]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' per mass ''m'' of the particle (written as ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) can be related to the rate of sweeping out areas

:&lt;math&gt;
h_1 = \frac{L_1}{m} = r v_1 = r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = 2 \frac{dA_1}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider a second particle whose orbit is identical in its radius, but whose angular variation is multiplied by a constant factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_2(t) = k \theta_1(t)\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

The areal velocity of the second particle equals that of the first particle multiplied by the same factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
h_2 = 2 \frac{dA_2}{dt} = r^2 \frac{d\theta_2}{dt} =
k r^2 \frac{d\theta_1}{dt} = 2 k \frac{dA_1}{dt} = k h_1
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''k'' is a constant, the second particle also sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Therefore, by Proposition 2, the second particle is also acted upon by a central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''). This is the conclusion of Proposition 43.

To find the magnitude of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') from the original central force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''), Newton calculated their difference {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') − ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} using geometry and the definition of [[centripetal acceleration]]. In Proposition 44 of his ''Principia'', he showed that the difference is proportional to the inverse cube of the radius, specifically by the formula given above, which Newtons writes in terms of the two constant areal velocities, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:''To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching very near to circles.''&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar192/&gt;

In this Proposition, Newton derives the consequences of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits. This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation also allows Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.

===Modern derivation===
Modern derivations of Newton's theorem have been published by [[E. T. Whittaker|Whittaker]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar]] (1995).&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar, p. 184"/&gt; By assumption, the second angular speed is ''k'' times faster than the first

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{2} = \frac{d\theta_{2}}{dt} = k \frac{d\theta_{1}}{dt} = k \omega_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two radii have the same behavior with time, ''r''(''t''), the conserved angular momenta are related by the same factor ''k''

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{2} = m r^{2} \omega_{2} = m r^{2} k \omega_{1} = k L_{1} \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for a radius ''r'' of a particle of mass ''m'' moving in a [[central force|central potential]] ''V''(''r'') is given by [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Lagrange's equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} - mr \omega^2 =
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} - \frac{L^2}{mr^3} = F(r)
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the general formula to the two orbits yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = F_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^{3}} = F_2(r) + \frac{L_2^2}{mr^3} = F_2(r) + \frac{k^2 L_1^2}{mr^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be re-arranged to the form

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{2}(r) = F_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation relating the two radial forces can be understood qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes a difference in the [[centripetal force]] requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.

Newton's theorem can be expressed equivalently in terms of [[potential energy]], which is defined for central forces

:&lt;math&gt; F(r) = -\frac{dV}{dr} &lt;/math&gt;

The radial force equation can be written in terms of the two [[potential energy|potential energies]]

:&lt;math&gt;
- \frac{dV_2}{dr} = - \frac{dV_1}{dr} + \frac{L_1^2}{mr^3} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating with respect to the distance ''r'', Newtons's theorem states that a ''k''-fold change in angular speed results from adding an inverse-square potential energy to any given potential energy ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')

:&lt;math&gt;
V_2(r) = V_1(r) + \frac{L_1^2}{2mr^2} \left( 1 - k^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Newton’s Geometric Proof from the Principia ==

[[File:Principia Revolving Orbits 2.jpg|Principia Revolving Orbits 2]]

=== Simplified Geometric Proof of Proposition 44 ===

Although Newton states that the problem was to be solved by Proposition 6, he does not use it explicitly. In the following, simplified proof, Proposition 6 is used to show how the result is derived.

Newton’s detailed proof follows that, and finally Proposition 6 is appended, as it is not well-known.

Proposition 44 uses Proposition 6 to prove a result about revolving orbits. In the propositions following Proposition 6 in Section 2 of the Principia, he applies it to specific curves, for example, conic sections. In the case of Proposition 44, it is applied to any orbit, under the action of an arbitrary force directed towards a fixed point, to produce a corresponding revolving orbit.

In Fig. 1. MN is part of that orbit. At point P, the body moves to Q under the action of a force directed towards S, as before. The force, F(SP) is defined at each point P on the curve.

In Fig.2, the corresponding part of the revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, the body in the static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v &gt; V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v &lt; V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.

Let SA be the initial direction of the static orbit, and sa, that of the revolving orbit. If after a certain time the bodies in the respective orbits are at P and p, then the ratio of the angles 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{asp}{ASP} = \frac{psq}{PSQ} = \frac{v}{V }
&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly the areas
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{asp}{ASP} = \frac{psq}{PSQ} = \frac{v}{V }
&lt;/math&gt;, and the radii:
&lt;math&gt; SP = sp &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; SQ = sq &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; SA = sa &lt;/math&gt;

The figure pryx and the arc py in Fig. 2 is the figure PRQT and the arc PQ in Fig. 1, expanded linearly in the horizontal direction in the ratio v / V, so that

&lt;math&gt;
PU = pu
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
UT = ux 
&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;
qt = \frac{ v.QT }{V}
&lt;/math&gt;. The straight lines qt and QT should really be circular arcs with centres s and S and radii sq and SQ respectively. In the limit, their ratio becomes &lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{V}&lt;/math&gt;, whether they are straight lines or arcs.

Since in the limit the forces are parallel to SP and sp, if the same force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed does not affect the vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.

However, the distance from y to the centre, s is now greater than SQ, so an additional force is required to move the body to q such that sq = SQ. The extra force is represented by yq, and f is proportional to ry + yq, just as F is to RQ.

&lt;math&gt;
RQ = SP - PU - ST 
&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;
rq = sp - pu - st = RQ + ST - st
&lt;/math&gt;

The difference, 
&lt;math&gt;
ST - st = yq
&lt;/math&gt;
can be found as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
ST^2 = SQ^2 - QT^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
st^2 = sq^2 - qt^2
&lt;/math&gt;, so 
&lt;math&gt;
(ST - st)(ST + st) = qt^2 - QT^2
&lt;/math&gt;

And in the limit, as QT and qt approach zero, ST + st becomes equal to SQ + sq or 2SP so

&lt;math&gt;
yq.2SP = \frac{QT^2(v^2 - V^2)}{V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
&lt;math&gt;
rq = RQ + ST - st = RQ + \frac{QT^2(v^2 - V^2) }{2SP.V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since from Proposition 6 (Fig.1 and see below), the force
&lt;math&gt;
= \frac{k.QR}{(SP^2.QT^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing by 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac {(SP^2.QT^2)}{k}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where k is constant. to obtain the forces
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{k(v^2 - V^2) }{2sp^3.V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

In Fig. 3 at the initial point A of the static curve, draw the tangent AR, which is perpendicular to SA and the circle AQD which just touches the curve at A. Let ρ be the radius of that circle. Since angle SAR is a right-angle, the centre of the circle lies on SA. From the property of a circle:

&lt;math&gt;
QT^2 = AT.(2\rho - AT) = RQ.(2\rho - RQ)
&lt;/math&gt;
and in the limit as Q approaches A, this becomes:
&lt;math&gt;
\rho =  QT^2 / 2RQ
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SA) = \frac{k}{(2\rho.SA^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;

And since F(SA) is given, this determines the constant k. However, Newton wants the force at A, to be of the form c.V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / SA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where c is a constant so that
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{c\rho (v^2 - V^2) }{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
Where
&lt;math&gt;
c = \frac{F(SA). SA^2}{V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for f(sp) above is the same as Newton’s in Corollary 4 of Proposition 44, except that he uses different letters. He writes &lt;math&gt; \frac{G}{F} = \frac{v}{V} &lt;/math&gt; (where G and F are not necessarily equal to v and V respectively), and uses the letter “V” for the constant corresponding to “c”, and the letter “X” for the function F(sp).
	
The above geometric proof shows very clearly where the additional force arises from to make the orbit revolve with respect to the static orbit.

=== Newton’s Proof of Proposition 44 ===

Newton’s proof is complicated, in view of the simplicity of the above proof. As an example, his proof requires some deciphering, as the following sentence shows:

“And therefore, if with centre C and any radius CP or Cp a circular sector is described equal to the total area VPC which the body P revolving in an immobile orbit has described in any time by a radius drawn to the centre, the difference between the forces by which the body P in an immobile orbit and body p in a mobile orbit revolve will be to the centripetal force by which some body, by a radius drawn to the centre, would have been able to describe that sector uniformly in the same time in which the area VPC was described as G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.”

He initially regards the infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as fixed, then the areas SPQ and spq are proportional to V and v, respectively and therefore:
&lt;math&gt;QT.SP \propto V\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;qt.sp \propto v\tau&lt;/math&gt; at each of the points, P and p and:

&lt;math&gt;yq = \frac{qt^2 - QT^2}{2sp} \propto \frac{1}{sp^3}&lt;/math&gt; so the additional force varies inversely as the cube of the radius.

In Fig.1, XQ is a circular arc, with centre S and radius SQ, meeting SP at X. The perpendicular XY meets RQ at Y, and &lt;math&gt;YQ = \frac{QT^2}{2SP}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(SQ)&lt;/math&gt; be the force required to make a body move in a circle of radius SQ, if it has the same speed as the transverse speed of the body in the static orbit at Q.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(sp) - F(sp)}{\phi(sp)} = \frac{yq}{YQ} = \frac{(qt^2 - QT^2) }{QT^2} = \frac{(v^2 - V^2) }{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

at every point, P and in particular at the apside, A:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(SA) - F(SA)}{\phi(SA)} = \frac{(v^2 - V^2) }{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

But at A, Fig. 3., the ratio of the force that makes the body follow the static curve, AE, to that required to make it follow the circle, AB, with radius SA, is inversely as the ratio of their radii of curvature, since they are both moving at the same speed, V, perpendicular to SA:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(SA)}{\phi(SA)} = \frac{SA}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, 
From the first part of the proof, &lt;math&gt; f(sp) - F(sp) = \frac{(f(sa) - F(sa))sa^3}{sp^3} = \frac{\rho.F(sa)sa^2.(v^2 - V^2)}{ V^2sp^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Newton’s expression for F(SA), gives the result obtained previously.

=== Newton’s Proof of Proposition 45 ===

“To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching circles.”

Proposition 44 was devised expressly to prove this Proposition. Newton wants to investigate the motion of a body in a nearly circular orbit attracted by a force of the form:
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \gamma.sp^{n - 3}
&lt;/math&gt;

He approximates the static curve by an ellipse with an inverse square force, F(SP) directed to one of the foci, made to revolve by the addition of an inverse cube force, according to Proposition 44.

For the static ellipse, with the force varying inversely as SP squared: 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SP) = \frac{cV^2}{SP^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;, 
since c is defined above so that 
&lt;math&gt;
F(SA) = \frac{cV^2}{SA^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the body in the static orbit starting from the upper apside at A, it will reach the lower apside, the point closest to S, after moving through an angle of 180degs. Newton wants a corresponding revolving orbit starting from apside, a, about a point s, with the lower apside shifted by an angle, α, where &lt;math&gt; \frac{(180 + \alpha)}{180} = \frac{v}{V} &lt;/math&gt;

The initial speed, V, at A must be just less than that required to make the body move in a circle. Then ρ can be taken as equal to SA or sa. The problem is to determine v from the value of n, so that α can be found, or given α, to find n.

&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = F(sp) + \frac{c\rho (v^2 - V^2)}{sp^3} =  \frac{c(spV^2 + sa(v^2 - V^2))}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt; sp = sa - X &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{c(sav^2 - XV^2)}{sp^3} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Then “by our method of converging series”:
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{\gamma.sp^n}{sp^3} = \frac{\gamma(sa - X)^n}{sp^3} = \frac{\gamma.sa^{n - 1}(sa - nX)}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt; plus terms in X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and above which can be ignored because the orbit is almost circular, so X is small compared to sa.

Comparing the 2 expressions for f(sp): &lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{\gamma.sa^{n-1}(sa - nX)}{sp^3} = \frac{c(sav^2 - XV^2)}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that:
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{v}{V} = \frac {1}{n ^{1/2}} = \frac{(180 + \alpha)}{180}
&lt;/math&gt;

Also, 
&lt;math&gt;
f(sp) = \frac{c.v^2sp^{n-3}}{sa^{n-1}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of the initial forces at a is given by:
&lt;math&gt; \frac{f(sa)}{F(sa)} = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proposition 6 for Proof of Proposition 44, above ===

In Fig. 1, a body is moving along a specific curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends only of the distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.

In a small time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the body moves from P to the nearby point Q. Draw QR parallel to SP meeting the tangent at R, and QT perpendicular to SP meeting it at T.

If there was no force present it would have moved along the tangent at P with the speed that it had at 
P, arriving at the point, R. If the force on the body moving from P to Q was constant in magnitude and parallel to the direction SP, the arc PQ would be parabolic with PR as its tangent and QR would be proportional to that constant force and the square of the time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if instead of arriving at R, the body was deflected to Q, then a constant force parallel to SP, with magnitude:
&lt;math&gt;
F \propto \frac{QR}{\tau^2}
&lt;/math&gt;  would have caused it to reach Q instead of R.

However, since the direction of the radius from S to points on the arc PQ and also the magnitude of the force towards S will change along PQ, the above relation will not give the exact force at P. If Q is sufficiently close to P, the direction of force will be almost parallel to SP all along PQ and if the force changes little, PQ can be assumed to be approximated by a parabolic arc with the force given as above in terms of QR and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The time, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the area of the sector SPQ. This is Kepler’s Second Law. A proof is demonstrated in Proposition 1, Book 1 in the Principia. Since the arc PQ can be approximated by a straight line, the area of the sector SPQ and the area of the triangle SPQ can be taken as equal so:

&lt;math&gt;
F \propto \frac{QR}{\tau^2} = \frac{k.QR}{(SP^2.QT^2) }
&lt;/math&gt;, where k is constant.

Again, this is not exact for finite lengths PQ. The force law is obtained if the limit of the above expression exists as a function of SP, as PQ approaches zero.

In fact, in time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the body with no force would have reached a point, W, further from P than R. However, in the limit QW becomes parallel to SP. The point W is ignored in Newton’s proof.

Also, Newton describes QR as the versed sine of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although this is not strictly the same as the QR that he has in the diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.

Notes:

This proposition is based on Galileo’s analysis of a body following a parabolic trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, he describes it as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation to it in the Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.

In the historically very important case where MN in Fig. 1 was part of an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards the fixed point S varied inversely as the square of the distance SP.

Besides the ellipse with the centre at the focus, Newton also applied Proposition 6 to the hyperbola (Proposition 12), and the parabola (Proposition 13). Also, to the ellipse with the centre of force at the centre of the ellipse (Proposition 10), to the equiangular spiral (Proposition 9), and to the circle, with the centre of force not coinciding with the centre, and even on the circumference (Proposition 7).

[[Bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[insects]], [[earthworms]], [[Hemiptera|bugs]], and other creatures dig and digest the compost into fertile soil. The minerals and nutrients in the soil is recycled back into the production of crops.

A '''nutrient cycle''' (or '''ecological recycling''') is the movement and exchange of [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] matter back into the [[Productivity (ecology)|production]] of matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of [[mineral nutrients]] is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the [[carbon cycle]], [[sulfur cycle]], [[nitrogen cycle]], [[water cycle]], [[phosphorus cycle]], [[oxygen cycle]], among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into [[Productivity (ecology)|productive]] ecological nutrition.

The nutrient cycle is nature's recycling system. All forms of recycling have feedback loops that use energy in the process of putting material resources back into use.

[[File:Nutrient cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem.]]

There is much overlap between the terms for the [[biogeochemical cycle]] and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms.&lt;ref name="Levin09"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Simon A|last2=Carpenter|first2=Stephen R|last3=Godfray|first3=Charles J|last4=Kinzig|first4=Ann P|last5=Loreau|first5=Michel|last6=Losos|first6=Jonathan B|last7=Walker|first7=Brian|last8=Wilcove|first8=David S|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|date=27 July 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MS-vfT89QMC&amp;pg=PA330 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs.&lt;ref name="Bormann67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bormann | first1=F.

Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by [[Howard T. Odum]] when he penned that "it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy"&lt;ref name="Odum91"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=H.

Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of [[biomass]] exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources). These differences relate to climate, topography, and geological history leaving behind different sources of parent material.&lt;ref name="Bormann67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van Noordwijk99"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | title=Nutrient cycles and nutrient budgets in global agro-ecosystems | editor1-last=Smaling | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=Oenema | editor2-first=O. | editor3-last=Fresco | editor3-first=L. | chapter=Nutrient cycling in ecosystems versus nutrient budgets in agricultural systems | pages=1–26 | place=Wallingford, UK | publisher=CAB International | url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/bookchapter/BC0104-04/BC0104-04-1.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of a food web, a cycle or loop is defined as "a directed sequence of one or more links starting from, and ending at, the same species."&lt;ref name="Cohen89"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Roughgarden | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=May | editor2-first=R.

==Ecological recycling==
{{quote box

A large fraction of the elements composing living matter reside at any instant of time in the world’s biota. Because the earthly pool of these elements is limited and the rates of exchange among the various components of the biota are extremely fast with respect to geological time, it is quite evident that much of the same material is being incorporated again and again into different biological forms. This observation gives rise to the notion that, on the average, matter (and some amounts of energy) are involved in cycles.&lt;ref name="Ulanowicz83"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ulanowicz | first1=R.

The persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as [[niche construction]] or ecosystem engineering.

[[Earthworms]], for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil as they crawl about ([[bioturbation]]), digest on the [[Mold|molds]] of organic matter they pull from the [[soil litter]]. These activities transport nutrients into the [[soil|mineral layers of soil]]. Worms discard wastes that create [[worm castings]] containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process.&lt;ref name="Barot06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barot | first1=S. | last2=Ugolini | first2=A. | last3=Brikci | first3=F.

[[Shellfish]] are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays through [[denitrification]]; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4) Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml? |title=Oceans and Coasts Shellfish Reefs at Risk: Critical Marine Habitats |author=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004110843/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of [[Charles Darwin]] in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about "the continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] in 1687.

===Variations in terminology===
In 1926 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] coined the term '''[[biogeochemistry]]''' as a sub-discipline of [[geochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Gorham91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gorham | first1=E. | title=Biogeochemistry: Its origins and development | journal=Biogeochemistry | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=199–239 | year=1991 | url=http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00002942}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term '''nutrient cycle''' pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: "These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic ''nutrient cycle'' for the standing timber.&lt;ref name="Silvilculture99"&gt;{{citation | title=Pamphlets on silviculture | volume=41 | year=1899 | publisher=The University of California | url=https://books.google.com/?id=2oc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22nutrient+cycle%22&amp;dq=%22nutrient+cycle%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} In 1898 there is a reference to the '''nitrogen cycle''' in relation to [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="RBGKew98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer on behalf of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | title=The advances made in agricultural chemistry during the last twenty-five years | journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew) | volume=1898 | issue=144 | pages=326–331 | year=1898 | jstor=4120250 | doi=10.2307/4120250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history:

*The term '''mineral cycle''' appears early in a 1935 in reference to the importance of minerals in [[plant physiology]]: "...ash is probably either built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the ''mineral cycle''."&lt;ref name="Penston35"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penston | first=N.

*The term '''nutrient recycling''' appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology of the wood stork: "While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community, the fluctuating water levels favor rapid ''nutrient recycling'' and subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production"&lt;ref name="Kahl64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kahl | first1=M.

*The term '''natural cycling''' appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries management: "Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a factor in ''natural cycling'' of chemical elements and in degradation of the land."&lt;ref name="Slack68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slack | first1=K.

*The term '''ecological recycling''' appears in a 1968 publication on future applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: "For our basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much more frequent ''ecological recycling'' than the land area. Fish and other organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less capricious weather problems for sea harvesting."&lt;ref name="McHale68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McHale | first1=J. | title=Toward the future | journal=Design Quarterly | volume=72 | issue=72 | pages=3–31 | year=1968 | jstor=4047350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The term '''bio-recycling''' appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of organic carbon in oceans: "Following the actualistic assumption, then, that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which prevent its ''bio-recycling'', we can see no major difference in the behavior of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic oceans."&lt;ref name="Nissenbaum76"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nissenbaum | first1=A. | title=Scavenging of soluble organic matter from the prebiotic oceans | journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=413–416 | doi=10.1007/BF00927936 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l37x7632v6767192/ | bibcode=1976OrLi....7..413N| year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Larsson10" /&gt;

'''Osram ne nsoromma''' is one of the [[Asante dialect|Asante]] [[Adinkra symbols]], which is interpreted to mean "Osram" [[Moon]] "Ne" and "Nsoromma" [[Star]]. This symbol signifies love, bonding and faithfulness in marriage. The symbol is represented by a half moon with a star slightly hanging within the [[circumference]] of the moon. Adinkra are symbols that carry a message or a concept. They are very much used by the Ashantis of the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti kingdom]] and the [[Baoulé people|Baoulés]] of [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]]. Osram ne nsoromma symbols are incorporated into walls and other architectural features and quite recently has become common with tattoo designers. The most common ways through which the Adinkra messages are carried out or conveyed is having them printed extensively in fabrics and used in pottery. Adinkra is an [[Akan people|Akan]] name which means farewell or goodbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adinkra.org/htmls/adinkra/osra.htm|title=Adinkra Symbols of West Africa: Osram Ne Nsoromma|website=www.adinkra.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ghanaculturepolitics.com/history-and-origin-of-adinkra-symbols/|title=History and Origin of Adinkra Symbols|date=25 April 2015|work=GhanaCulturePolitics|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adinkrasymbols.org/osram-ne-nsoromma/|title=Osram ne Nsoromma Adinkra Symbol, Meaning, Pronunciation, Discussion|work=Adinkra Symbols|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obrunithroughghana.blogspot.com/2010/09/akan-symbols.html|title=Adventures in Ghana: Akan Symbols|last=Adventure|first=Rachel|date=16 September 2010|website=Adventures in Ghana|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ghanaculturepolitics.com/history-and-origin-of-adinkra-symbols/|title=History and Origin of Adinkra Symbols|date=25 April 2015|work=GhanaCulturePolitics|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentsanddesigns.com/resources/symbols-meanings-religion-ethnic-culture/adinkra-symbols/|title=Adinkra Symbols of West Africa – Documents and Designs|website=www.documentsanddesigns.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osram ne nsoromma are two different powerful objects of creation put together (Moon and Star). Both co exist in the [[sky]] to produce magnificent light or brightness at night. There are some wise sayings closely related to the Osram ne nsoromma symbol,often linked with [[proverb]]s

== Related proverbs ==
The [[Akan people|Akans]] of [[Ghana]] use an Adinkra symbol to express proverbs and other philosophical ideas or traditional [[wisdom]], aspects of life or the environment.

Some of the familiar proverbs are:

''Awaree nye nsafufuo na waka ahwe'', which means marriage is not [[Palm wine|palm-wine]] that you can decide to have a taste before you get served. It can also be interpreted to mean marriage is not a venture,committee or an organization that you can be a member today and withdraw your membership tomorrow. This proverb frowns upon break ups or separations in marriages or relationships.

''Woreko awaree a bisa'', This proverb talks about [[due diligence]] before marriage. it is wise to do a background check on your partner before marriage or the worse will happen. Making the wrong choice is sometimes costly. Similarly,most of the proverbs seem to put value on the object being addressed. This symbol signifies Love,bonding and faithfulness but one must carefully choose the right partner.

''Ahwenepa nkasa,'' can be interpreted to mean ''"Ahwenepa"''( Good waist [[bead]]s) "''nkasa''" (makes no noise). This can be related to mean a good man or a good woman needs no introduction to be known. You can notice them when you find them. This proverb talks about the character of the would be partner. Good man or woman is hard to find but when you meet that special person,you will notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.design233.com/oldhtml/Art/akan_proverbs_as_message_making_tools_in_graphic_design.html#.WhVvXnnLfIV |title=Design233 {{!}} Akan Proverbs as Message-Making Tools in Graphic Design|last=Larbi|first=Korantemaa|website=www.design233.com|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adinkrasymbols.org/osram-ne-nsoromma/|title=Osram ne Nsoromma Adinkra Symbol, Meaning, Pronunciation, Discussion|work=Adinkra Symbols|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]],  '''the line''' or '''the party line''' is an [[idiom]] for a [[political party]] or [[social movement]]'s [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] [[Political agenda|agenda]], as well as ideological elements specific to the organization's [[partisan (political)|partisanship]]. The common phrase [[toe the line|toeing the party line]] describes a person who speaks in a manner that conforms to his political party's agenda.  Likewise, a [[party-line vote]] is one in which most or all of the legislators from each political party voted in accordance with that party's policies. In several countries, a [[Whip (politics)|whip]] attempts to ensure this.

The [[Marxist-Leninist]] concept (see [[General line of the party]]) of [[democratic centralism]] involves strict adherence to, and defense of, a [[communist party]]'s positions in public.

According to American educator [[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Uncommon Differences: On Political Correctness, Core Curriculum and Democracy in Education|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v016/16.1.kohl.html|journal = The Lion and the Unicorn|date = 1992-01-01|issn = 1080-6563|pages = 1–16|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/uni.0.0216|first = Herbert|last = Kohl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "[[Political correctness|politically correct]]" was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, in inner-party debate sessions, the line can be questioned, criticized, and changed if necessary.{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}

Used loosely, the phrase "the party line" may also refer to the non-party organizations such as religious groups, business offices, or a social network that may have a semi-official organizational policy or position that is unrelated to any political party.

'''PHaradise''' is a permanent light installation conceived by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]] at the Kunsthalle Mannheim, which was inaugurated on 9 March 2007, located at the dome and the adjacent roof tops of the Hermann Billing Bau at [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]].&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It represents the act of breathing before falling asleep. The inspiration is represented by cold white light flowing vertically from below into the dome, and the exhalation by warm white colored lights air flowing horizontally towards the rooftops beside the cupola.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to this evening light motion, the viewer has the experience of reliving the breath of the architectural structure, which is transformed into a light sculpture in the [[:de:Skulpturengarten der Kunsthalle Mannheim|Skulpturengarten]]. The "breathing" rhythm becomes slower as time pass by during the evening, symbolizing falling asleep.

PHaradise overlooks the Phoenix Room of [[HHole| HHole for Mannheim]], a multimedia installation at the rooftop of the Athene-Trakt of the Museum, where, among other things, natural light flows into the museum through its seven holes, meeting artificial light coming from below, thus creating a symbolic imaginary space between heaven and earth.

The architecture of the Kunsthalle becomes "alive", changing its own breathing rhythm similar to a living being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise écologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

===Australia===
The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} Aïna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L’autre or de la Suisse, ses déchets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402182915/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/liability/pdf/quick-guide-regs09.pdf The Environmental Damage Regulations: Preventing and Remedying Environmental Damage], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement |title=Air Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-01 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement |title=Water Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste and hazardous waste management),&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/waste-chemical-and-cleanup-enforcement |title=Waste, Chemical, and Cleanup Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Superfund]] (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"/&gt;

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:
* the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] for motor vehicles
* [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE), a "polluter pays" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].
* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=June 1996 |title=The Buck Stops Here: Polluters are Paying for Most Hazardous Waste Cleanups |periodical=Superfund Today (newsletter) |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=10001XKT.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-540-K-96/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, an [[Polluter pays amendment|amendment]] was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]].

====Limitations of polluter pays principle====
The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in [[United States environmental law|US laws]] and programs. For example, [[water purification|drinking water]] and [[sewage treatment]] services are [[subsidy|subsidized]] and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2003 |title=Water and Wastewater Pricing: An Informational Overview |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/901U1200.PDF?Dockey=901U1200.PDF |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-03-027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Zimbabwe]] Environmental Management Act of 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/legisl/env_mgmt_act_060325.pdf Chapter 20:27]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the "Polluter Pays" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald (Harare), [http://www.herald.co.zw/polluter-pays-as-environmental-management-principle/ Polluter pays as environmental management principle], 18 May 2016, accessed 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international environmental law==
In [[international environmental law]] it is mentioned in the principle 16 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

In [[type theory]], a '''polynomial functor''' (or '''container functor''') is a kind of [[endofunctor]] of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of types that is intimately related to the concept of [[Inductive type|inductive]] and [[Coinduction|coinductive]] types. Specifically, all [[W type|W-types]] (resp. M-types) are (isomorphic to) [[initial algebra]]s (resp. [[final coalgebra]]s) of such functors.

Polynomial functors have been studied in the more general setting of a [[Topos|pretopos]] with Σ-types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moerdijk|first=Ieke|last2=Palmgren|first2=Erik|title=Wellfounded trees in categories|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-0072(00)00012-9|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=104|issue=1–3|pages=189–218|doi=10.1016/s0168-0072(00)00012-9|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; this article deals only with the applications of this concept inside the category of types of a [[Intuitionistic type theory|Martin-Löf style type theory]].

== Definition ==

Let {{var|U}} be a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]] of types, let {{var|A}} : {{var|U}}, and let {{var|B}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}} be a family of types indexed by {{var|A}}. The pair ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is sometimes called a '''signature'''{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 1}} or a '''container'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=4}} The '''polynomial functor''' associated to the container ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is defined as follows:{{sfn|Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Equation 5.4.6}}{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 2}}{{sfn|Awodey|2012|p=8}}
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P : U &amp;\longrightarrow U \\
  X &amp;\longmapsto \sum_{a:A} (B(a) \to X)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Any functor naturally isomorphic to {{var|P}} is called a  '''container functor'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=10}} The action of {{var|P}} on functions is defined by 
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^* : (X\to Y) &amp;\longrightarrow (P^*X\to P^*Y) \\
  (f, (a,g)) &amp;\longmapsto (a,g\circ f)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this assignment is not only truly functorial in extensional type theories (see [[#Properties]]).

== Properties ==

In intensional type theories, such functions are not truly functors, because the universe type is not strictly a category (the field of [[homotopy type theory]] is dedicated to exploring how the universe type behaves more like a [[Higher category theory|higher category]]). However, it is functorial up to propositional equalities, that is, the following identity types are inhabited:
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^*(f\circ g) &amp;= P^*f\circ P^*g \\
  P^*(\mathsf{id}_X) &amp;= \mathsf{id}_{PX}
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
for any functions {{var|f}} and {{var|g}} and any type {{var|X}}, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] on the type {{var|X}}.{{sfn|Awodey|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10882">A '''pretext''' (adj: '''pretextual''') is an excuse to do something or say something that is not accurate. Pretexts may be based on a half-truth or developed in the context of a misleading fabrication. Pretexts have been used to conceal the true purpose or rationale behind actions and words.

In [[Law of the United States|US law]], a pretext usually describes false reasons that hide the true intentions or motivations for a legal action. If a party can establish a [[prima facie]] case for the proffered evidence, the opposing party must prove that these reasons were "pretextual" or false. This can be accomplished by directly demonstrating that the motivations behind the presentation of evidence is false, or indirectly by evidence that the motivations are not "credible".&lt;ref name=uslegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Pretext Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/pretext/|publisher=uslegal.com|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Griffith v. Schnitzer'', an employment discrimination case, a jury award was reversed by a [[Court of Appeals]] because the evidence was not sufficient that the defendant's reasons were "pretextual". That is, the defendant's evidence was either undisputed, or the plaintiff's  was "irrelevant subjective assessments and opinions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omwlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Defining-Pretext-In-Discrimination-Cases.pdf Defining "pretext" in discrimination cases] by Karen Sutherland (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A "pretextual" arrest by law enforcement officers is one carried out for illegal purposes such as to conduct an unjustified [[search and seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.wne.edu/161/8_note_Criminal.pdf Criminal law - Pretextual arrests and alternatives to the objective tests] by Robert D.

[[File:Marbleboot.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Marble Boat]] on [[Kunming Lake]] near Beijing]]
As one example of pretext, in the 1880s, the Chinese government raised money on the pretext of modernizing the Chinese navy. Instead, these funds were diverted to repair a ship-shaped, two-story pavilion which had been originally constructed for [[Empress Xiaoshengxian|the mother]] of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. This pretext and the Marble Barge are famously linked with [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. This architectural [[folly]], known today as the [[Marble Boat]] (''Shifang''), is "moored" on Lake Kunming in what the empress renamed the "Garden for Cultivating Harmony" (''Yiheyuan'').&lt;ref&gt;Min, Anchee. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_H8TYkS84E4C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=marble+barge&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA155,M1  ''The Last Empress,'' pp. 155-156;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of pretext was demonstrated in the speeches of the Roman orator [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BC). For Cato, every public speech became a pretext for a comment about Carthage. The Roman statesman had come to believe that the prosperity of ancient Carthage represented an eventual and inevitable danger to Rome. In the Senate, Cato famously ended every speech by proclaiming his opinion that [[Carthage]] had to be destroyed (''[[Carthago delenda est]]''). This oft-repeated phrase was the ultimate conclusion of all logical argument in every oration, regardless of the subject of the speech. This pattern persisted until his death in 149, which was the year in which the Third Punic War began. In other words, any subject became a pretext for reminding his fellow senators of the dangers Carthage represented.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, William Davis ''et al.'' (1934).

==Uses in warfare==

The early years of Japan's [[Tokugawa shogunate]] were unsettled, with warring factions battling for power. The causes for the fighting were in part pretextural, but the outcome brought diminished armed conflicts after the [[Siege of Osaka]] in 1614-1615.
* '''1614''' (''Keichō 19''): The Shogun vanquished Hideyori and set fire to [[Osaka Castle]], and then he returned for the winter to [[Edo]].&lt;ref name="t410"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  p. 410.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 24, 1614''' (''Keichō 19, 19th day of the 7th month''): A new bronze bell for the Hōkō-ji was cast successfully [http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=4771] [http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=3093]; but despite the dedication ceremony planning, Ieyasu forbade any further actions concerning the great bell:
::"[T]he tablet over the Daibutsu-den and the bell bore the inscription ''"Kokka ankō"'' (meaning "the country and the house, peace and tranquility"), and at this [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] affect to take umbrage, alleging that it was intended as a curse on him for the character 安 (''an,'' "peace") was placed between the two characters composing his own name 家康 (''"ka-kō",'' "house tranquility") [suggesting subtly perhaps that peace could only be attained by Ieyasu's dismemberment?] ... This incident of the inscription was, of course, a mere pretext, but Ieyasu realized that he could not enjoy the power he had usurped as long as Hideyori lived, and consequently, although the latter more than once Hideyori dispatched his vassal Katagiri Kastumoto to Ieyasu's residence ([[Sunpu Castle]]) with profuse apologies, Ieyasu refused to be placated."&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto, the Old Capital of Japan,'' p. 292; Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  p. 410.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October 18, 1614''' (''Keichō 19, 25th day of the 10th month''): A strong earthquake shook Kyoto.&lt;ref name="t410"/&gt;
* '''1615''' (''Keichō 20''): Osaka Summer Battle begins.

The next two-and-a-half centuries of Japanese history were comparatively peaceful under the successors of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the [[bakufu]] government he established.

===United States===
* During the War of 1812, US President [[James Madison]] was often accused of using impressment of American sailors by the [[Royal Navy]] as a pretext to invade [[Canada]].

{{main|Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate}}
* Some have argued that United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941 as a pretext to enter [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/15/books/books-of-the-times-on-dec-7-did-we-know-we-knew.html "On Dec. 7, Did We Know We Knew?"] ''New York Times.'' December 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; American soldiers and supplies had been assisting British and Soviet operations for almost a year by this point, and the United States had thus "chosen a side", but due to the political climate in the States at the time and some campaign promises made by Roosevelt that he would not send American boys to fight in foreign wars. Roosevelt could not declare war for fear of public backlash. The attack on Pearl Harbor united the American people's resolve against the Axis powers and created the bellicose atmosphere in which to declare war.
* Critics have accused United States President [[George W. Bush]] of using the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]] and faulty intelligence about the existence of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as a pretext for the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian. (2006). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/07/usa.books  "Book says CIA tried to provoke Saddam to war,"] ''The Guardian'' (London). 7 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social engineering==
{{main|Social engineering (security)}}
A type of [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] called [[Social engineering (security)#Pretexting|pretexting]] uses a pretext to elicit information fraudulently  from a target.

'''Privacy software''' is [[Computer software|software]] built to protect the [[privacy]] of its users. The software typically works in conjunction with [[Internet]] usage to control or limit the amount of information made available to third parties. The software can apply [[encryption]] or filtering of various kinds.

==Types of protection==

Privacy software can refer to two different types of protection.  One type is protecting a user's [[Internet privacy]] from the [[World Wide Web]]. There are software products that will mask or hide a user's [[IP address]] from the outside world in order to protect the user from [[identity theft]].  The second type of protection is hiding or deleting the users Internet traces that are left on their PC after they have been surfing the Internet.  There is software that will erase all the users Internet traces and there is software that will hide and encrypt a user's traces so that others using their PC will not know where they have been surfing.

===Whitelisting and blacklisting===

One solution to enhance privacy software is [[whitelisting]]. Whitelisting is a process in which a company identifies the software that it will allow to and does not try to recognize malware. Whitelisting permits acceptable software to run and either prevents anything else from running or lets new software run in a quarantined environment until the can verify its validity. Whereas whitelisting allows nothing to run unless it is on the whitelist, [[blacklisting]] allows everything to run unless it is on the black. A blacklist then includes certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer-to-peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices, and web sites can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.

=== Intrusion detection systems ===
{{Main|Intrusion detection system}}
Intrusion detection systems are designed to detect all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that cannot be detected by a firewall. These systems capture all network traffic flows and examine the contents of each packet for malicious traffic.

=== Encryption ===
{{Main|Encryption software}}
[[Encryption]] is another form for privacy security. When organizations do not have secure channel for sending information, they use encryption to stop unauthorized eavesdroppers. Encryption is the process of converting an original message into a form that cannot be read by anyone except the intended receiver.

=== Steganography ===

[[Steganography]] is sometimes used to hide messages from eavesdropping and e-surveillance.

== Privacy vs anonymity ==

Privacy is different from [[anonymity]] in its applicability and usage. Anonymity is subordinate to privacy and might be desired for the exchange, retrieval or publication of specific information.

== Legal issues of use ==
Uses of privacy software are not free from legal issues. For instance, there are regulations for [[export of cryptography from the United States]]. Similarly, [[key disclosure law]] also requires individuals to surrender cryptographic keys to law enforcement agencies. Encryption laws in India also carry many legal restrictions in diverse situations.&lt;ref name="http://perry4law.co.in/blog/?p=67"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://perry4law.co.in/blog/?p=67|title= Encryption Laws In India|work= Cyber Law, Cyber Security, Telecom Laws And Telecom Security Legal Due Diligence And Statutory Compliance Services In India |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks are also in pipeline to include cyber security technologies, like encryption related software, under the Wassenaar Arrangement thereby making its export more cumbersome.&lt;ref name="http://perry4law.co.in/cyber_security/?p=61"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://perry4law.co.in/cyber_security/?p=61|title= India Opposes Proposal To Include Cyber Security Technologies Under The Wassenaar Arrangement|work= International Legal Issues Of Cyber Attacks, Cyber Terrorism, Cyber Espionage, Cyber Warfare And Cyber Crimes|date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3623">{{Short description|philosophical concept that a subject as privileged access to their own thoughts}}
{{Use American English|date=September 2018}}
In the fields of [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of mind]], a person (the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], the [[Self (philosophy)|self]]) has '''privileged access''' to their own [[thoughts]]. This implies the subject has access to, and knows, their own thoughts (has [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]) in such a way that [[Other (philosophy)|other]]s do not. Privileged access can be characterized in two ways:

* ''Positive characterization'': privileged access comes through [[introspection]].
* ''Negative characterization'': [[knowledge]] derived from privileged access is not based upon [[evidence]]s.

==Analysis==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The still prevailing traditional position argues each of us do in fact have privileged access to our own thoughts. [[Descartes]] is the paradigmatic proponent of such kind of view (even though "privileged access" is an anachronic label for his thesis):

{{Quote|While we thus reject all of which we can entertain the smallest doubt, and even imagine that it is false, we easily indeed suppose that there is neither God, nor sky, nor bodies, and that we ourselves even have neither hands nor feet, nor, finally, a body; but we cannot in the same way suppose that we are not while we doubt of the truth of these things; for there is a repugnance in conceiving that what thinks does not exist at the very time when it thinks. Accordingly, the knowledge, I THINK, THEREFORE I AM, is the first and most certain that occurs to one who philosophizes orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René. 1641, ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Part I, VII [http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/01.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Descartes, we still have privileged access even in the [[Cartesian doubt|doubt]] scenario. That is, for him we would retain [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] even in those extreme situations in which we can't have knowledge about anything else.

[[Gilbert Ryle]], on the other hand, maintains a diametrically opposed view. According to the [[behaviorism]] of Ryle, each of us knows our own thoughts in the same way we know other's thoughts. We only come to know the thoughts of others through their linguistic and bodily behaviors, and must do exactly the same in order to know our own thoughts. There is no privileged access. We only have access to what we think upon [[evidence]]s supplied through our own actions.

'''Dr. Robert J. Goldstein''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Conspiracies (Television)|conspirator]] who plotted with two accomplices to destroy the Islamic Education Center in [[Pinellas County]], [[Florida]] with homemade [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]].{{when?|date=January 2017}} A police search of the Goldstein home found a list of 50 Islamic worship centers on Florida, home-made explosives and a mission statement to "Kill all rags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/08/23/florida.explosives/index.html |title=Florida man plotted mosque attacks, feds say |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2006-12-18 | date=2002-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein admitted that he planned to destroy the center and plead guilty to conspiracy to violate civil rights, conspiracy to damage religious property, and possession of unlicensed [[destructive device]]s. He was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison.

Ahmed Bedier, a spokesman for the [[Council for American-Islamic Relations]] who worshipped at the Pinellas County mosque, alleged double standards in the treatment of Goldstein and argued that Goldstein should have been prosecuted as a terrorist, but prosecutors said the facts of the case didn't warrant such a charge. "I'm happy he's behind bars and will serve some time, but it's nowhere enough for the damage he intended to do," Bedier said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cair-florida.org/podiatrist_guilty.htm |title=Podiatrist Pleads Guilty in Plot to Attack Islamic Center |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2006-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007071622/http://www.cair-florida.org/podiatrist_guilty.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BothSankofa.png|thumb|right|Dual versions of Sankofa. The original is the Sankofa heart. The alternate is the Sankofa bird]] --&gt;

'''Sankofa''' is a word in the [[Twi language]] of [[Ghana]] that translates to "Go back and get it" (''san'' - to return; ''ko'' - to go; ''fa'' - to fetch, to seek and take) and also refers to the [[Asante dialect|Asante]] [[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]] [[symbol]] represented either with a stylized heart shape or by a bird with its head turned backwards while its feet face forward carrying a precious egg in its mouth. Sankofa is often associated with the proverb, “''Se wo were fi na wosankofa a yenkyi''," which translates as: "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/Literature/sankofa.cfm |title=African Tradition, Proverbs, and Sankofa |author=The Spirituals Project at the University of Denver |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420131901/http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/literature/sankofa.cfm | archivedate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being used on adinkra cloth in Ghana, the Sankofa heart is a common design on gates in the United States, particularly New York City. In Brooklyn, the Sankofa heart is commonly upside down on gates to Brownstone residential buildings.

The sankofa bird appears frequently in traditional [[Akan art]], and has also been adopted as an important symbol in an [[African-American]] and [[African Diaspora]] context to represent the need to reflect on the past to build a successful future. It is one of the most widely dispersed adinkra symbols, appearing in modern jewelry, tattoos, and clothing.

==Akan symbolism==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 45.11.5 Gold Weight in Form of Sankofa Bird.jpg|thumb|Akan Gold Weight Sankofa]]
The [[Akan people]] of Ghana use an Adinkra symbol to represent this same idea and one version of it is similar to the eastern symbol of a heart, and another version is that of a bird with its head turned backwards taking an egg off its back. It symbolizes taking from the past what is good and bringing it into the present in order to make positive progress through the benevolent use of knowledge. Adinkra symbols are used by the [[Akan people]] to express [[proverb]]s and other philosophical ideas.

The sankofa bird also appears on carved wooden Akan stools,&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown at [http://www.conradiator.com/essays/ghanamuseum.html conradiator.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Akan goldweights]], on some ruler's state umbrella or parasol (''ntuatire'') finials and on the staff finials of some court linguists.&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown on the [http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa myfundi.co.za page on the gold and proverbs of West Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175728/http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It functions to foster mutual respect and unity in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html fa.indiana.edu site on Akan goldweights] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802030832/http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html |date=2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a building excavation in [[Lower Manhattan]] in 1991, a cemetery for free and enslaved Africans was discovered.  Over 400 remains were identified, but one coffin in particular stood out.

Sankofa symbols show themselves all over cities like [[Washington, DC]] and [[New Orleans]], particularly in fence designs.

[[Janet Jackson]] has a sankofa tattoo on her inner right wrist. The symbol is also featured in her 1997 album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', as well as on the supporting tour.

Sankofa is an event used by [[Saint Louis University]] to honor African-American student graduates and students who graduate with degrees in African American studies.

The symbol and name were used in the 1993 film ''[[Sankofa (1993 film)|Sankofa]]'' by [[Haile Gerima]], as well as in the graphic title of the film'' [[500 Years Later]]'' by [[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]].

A second iteration of the band Sankofa, with Wilson and Flemons, as well as Ndidi Onukwulu and Allison Russell, released the CD ''The Uptown Strut'' in 2012.

[[Cassandra Wilson]] recorded the song "Sankofa", which appeared on her 1993 ''Blue Light 'Til Dawn'' CD.

Sankofa is the name of a Liverpool band formed in 2010. They have released one single "Siren Song" and a four-track EP that includes "Guttermouth" (both available on vinyl and as a download).


A Sankofa bird was carved into the floor of a slave ship by James Keziah Delaney in the second episode of the BBC Television show ''[[Taboo (2017 TV series)|Taboo]]'', and also appears as a tattoo on his upper back.

The '''settlement movement''' was a [[reformist]] social movement that began in the 1880s and peaked around the 1920s in England and the U.S. Its goal was to bring the rich and the poor of society together in both physical proximity and social interconnectedness. Its main object was the establishment of "settlement houses" in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class "settlement workers" would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and [[poverty reduction|alleviate the poverty]] of, their low-income neighbors. The "settlement houses" provided services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===England===
The movement started in London in 1884 with the founding of [[Toynbee Hall]]. These houses, radically different from those in America, often offered food, shelter, and basic and [[higher education]], provided by virtue of charity on part of wealthy donors, the residents of the city, and (for education) scholars who volunteered their time.

[[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, increasingly concerned with poverty, gave rise to the movement whereby those connected to universities settled students in slum areas to live and work alongside local people. Through their efforts settlement houses were established for education, savings, sports, and arts. Such institutions were often praised by religious representatives concerned with the lives of the poor, and criticised as normative or moralistic by radical social movements.

There were basic commonalities in the movement.  These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialisation, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.

[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|Toynbee Hall settlement house, founded 1884, pictured here in 1902]]
The [[British Association of Settlements and Social Action Centres]] is a network of such organisations. During the [[Social Gospel|social Christian movement]], [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] founded Toynbee Hall, [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green. Other early examples include [[Browning Hall]], formed in [[Walworth]] in 1895 by [[Francis Herbert Stead]], and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see [[Percy Alden]]). There is also a global network, the [[International Federation of Settlements]].

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, "have been a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago''  Dissertation Abstract International'', ''69''(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

As higher education opened up to women, young female graduates brought their energy to the settlement movement. The Women's University Settlement (now Blackfriars Settlement) was founded in 1887 "by women from [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College]]s at [[Cambridge University]], [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret]] and [[Somerville College]]s at [[Oxford University]] and [[Bedford College, London|Bedford]] and [[Royal Holloway]] Universities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/history |website=www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United States===
[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois]]
Between 1890 and 1910, more than 12 million European people immigrated to the United States. They came from Ireland, Russia, Italy and other European countries and provided cheap factory labor, a demand that was created with the country's [[Manifest destiny|expansion into the west]] following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many immigrants lived in crowded and disease-ridden tenements, worked long hours, and lived in poverty. Children often worked to help support the family. [[Jacob Riis]] wrote ''How the Other Half Lives'' about the lives of immigrants on New York City's Lower East Side to bring greater awareness of the immigrant's living conditions.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Friedman|author2=Brett Friedman|title=Settlement Houses: Improving the Social Welfare of America's Immigrants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NTibovoz4EC|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rosen Classroom|isbn=978-1-4042-0859-9|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous settlement house in the United States is [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]], founded by [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the previous two years. Hull House, though, was not a religious-based organization. It focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katharine Coman]], [[Vida Dutton Scudder|Vida Scudder]], and [[Katharine Lee Bates]] were among a group of women who founded Denison House in Boston in 1892. [[Lenox Hill Neighborhood House]], founded in 1894, Friendly Inn Settlement House, founded in 1874, [[Henry Street Settlement]], founded in 1893, [[Hiram House]], founded in 1896, and [[University Settlement Society of New York|University Settlement House]], founded in 1886 and the oldest in the United States, were, like Hull House, important sites for social reform. United Neighborhood Houses of New York is the federation of 38 settlement houses in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhny.org&lt;/ref&gt; These and other settlement houses inspired the establishment of [[settlement school]]s to serve isolated rural communities in [[Appalachia]], such as the [[Hindman Settlement School]] in 1902 and the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in 1913.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, there were almost 500 settlement houses in the country.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; The settlement house concept was continued by [[Dorothy Day]]'s [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] "hospitality houses" in the 1930s.

American settlement houses functioned on a philosophy of “scientific philanthropy,” a belief that instead of giving direct relief, charities should give resources to the poor so they could break out of the circle of poverty.  American charity workers feared that the deeply entrenched [[social class]] system in Europe would develop in the United States.

===Russia===
[[File:Wiki_Zelenko_Kindergarten_Vadkovsky_Lane.jpg|thumb|Site of the Communal Club for Working Children, a cornerstone of the Russian Settlement network.]]
The movement also spread to late imperial Russia, as [[Stanislav Shatsky]] and [[Alexander Zelenko]] set up a network of educational and social institutions in northern [[Moscow]] in 1905, naming it "Setlement" ("{{lang|ru|Сетлемент}}", the English word transliterated to Russian). This network of institutions was closed down by the government in 1908, due to alleged [[Socialism|socialist]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Valkanova, Y. &amp; Brehony, K. J.

==Description==
Today, settlements are still community-focused organizations, providing a range of services including early education, youth guidance and crime intervention, senior programs, and specialized programs for young people who have "aged out" of the foster care system. Since they are staffed by professional employees and students, they no longer require that employees live alongside those they serve.

==Legacy and impact==
Settlement houses influenced [[urban design]] and [[architecture]] in the 20th century. 
For example, [[James Rossant]] of Conklin + Rossant agreed with [[Robert E. Simon]]'s social vision and consciously sought to mix economic backgrounds when drawing up the master plan for [[Reston, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género. [Reproductive health and violence against women: an analysis from the gender perspective of Nuevo Leon, Asociación Mexicana de Población, Colegio de México, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual violence may occur without physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi M et al. Silence for the sake of harmony: domestic violence and women’s health in central Java. Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

[[Image:HoleForceLines.gif|thumb|right| Internal [[force lines]] are denser near the hole]]

A '''stress concentration''' (often called '''stress raisers''' or '''stress risers''') is a location in an object where [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is concentrated. An object is stronger when force is evenly distributed over its area, so a reduction in area, e.g., caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a [[crack propagation|propagating crack]], when a concentrated stress exceeds the material's theoretical cohesive strength. The real [[fracture]] strength of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] cracks always start at stress raisers, so removing such defects increases the [[fatigue strength]].

==Causes==
[[Image:Cracking in concrete due to stress concentration.jpg|right|thumb|The sharp corner at the brick has acted as a stress concentrator within the concrete causing it to crack]]

1) Geometric discontinuities cause an object to experience a local increase in the intensity of a stress field.  Examples of shapes that cause these concentrations are cracks, sharp corners, holes, and changes in the cross-sectional area of the object. High local stresses can cause objects to fail more quickly, so engineers must design the geometry to minimize stress concentrations.

2) Due to discontinuities in applied loads.

3) Material discontinuities which may occur while manufacturing.

==Prevention==
A counter-intuitive method of reducing one of the worst types of stress concentrations, a [[Fracture|crack]], is to [[drill]] a large hole at the end of the crack.  The drilled hole, with its relatively large [[diameter]], causes a smaller stress concentration than the sharp end of a crack.  This is however, a temporary solution that must be corrected at the first opportune time. 

It is important to systematically check for possible stress concentrations caused by cracks—there is a critical crack length of 2a for which, when this value is exceeded, the crack proceeds to definite catastrophic failure. This ultimate failure is definite since the crack will propagate on its own once the length is greater than 2a. (There is no additional energy required to increase the crack length so the crack will continue to enlarge until the material fails.) The origins of the value 2a can be understood through [[A. A. Griffith|Griffith]]'s theory of [[fracture#Brittle fracture|brittle fracture]].

Another method used to decrease the stress concentration is by creating the fillet at the sharp edges. It gives smooth flow of stress streamlines. In a threaded component force flow line is bent as it passes from shank portion to threaded portion as a result stress concentration takes place. To reduce this a small undercut is taken between shank and threaded portion.

==Examples==
[[Image:Cdm hip implant 348.jpg|right|thumb|This [[orthosis]] is implanted to support the femur after a [[hip fracture|fracture]], but the concentration of stress at its bend increases the possibility that it may break under force.]]
The term "stress raiser" is used in [[orthopedics]]; a focus point of stress on an [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] [[orthosis]] is very likely to be its point of failure.

Classic cases of [[metallurgy|metal]] failures due to stress concentrations include [[metal fatigue]] at the corners of the windows of the [[De Havilland Comet]] [[aircraft]] and brittle fractures at the corners of hatches in [[Liberty ship]]s in cold and stressful conditions in winter storms in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Concentration factor for cracks==

The maximum stress felt near a crack occurs in the area of lowest [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].  In an elliptical crack of length &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; and width &lt;math&gt;2b&lt;/math&gt;, under an applied external stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the stress at the ends of the major axes is given by Inglis' equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max} = \sigma\left(1+2\cfrac{a}{b}\right) = \sigma\left(1+2\sqrt{\cfrac{a}{\rho}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the radius of curvature of the crack tip.  A '''stress concentration factor''' is the ratio of the highest stress (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) to a reference stress (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) of the gross cross-section.  As the radius of curvature approaches zero, the maximum stress approaches infinity.  Note that the stress concentration factor is a function of the geometry of a crack, and not of its size.  These factors can be found in typical engineering reference materials to predict the stresses  that could otherwise not be analyzed using [[strength of materials]] approaches.  This is not to be confused with '[[Stress Intensity Factor]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schijve |first=Jaap |title=Fatigue of Structures and Materials |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |page=90 |isbn=978-0792370147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration factor calculation==
There are experimental methods for measuring stress concentration factors including [[photoelasticity|photoelastic stress analysis]], brittle coatings or [[strain gauge]]s. While all these approaches have been successful, all also have experimental, environmental, accuracy and/or measurement disadvantages.

During the design phase, there are multiple approaches to estimating stress concentration factors. Several catalogs of stress concentration factors have been published. Perhaps most famous is ''Stress Concentration Design Factors'' by Peterson, first published in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Rudolf Earl |title=Stress Concentration Design Factors |year=1953 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0471683766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finite element method]]s are commonly used in design today. Theoretical approaches, using elasticity or strength of material considerations, can lead to equations similar to the one shown above.

There may be small differences between the catalog, FEM and theoretical values calculated. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Many catalog curves were derived from experimental data. FEM calculates the peak stresses directly and nominal stresses may be easily found by integrating stresses in the surrounding material. The result is that engineering judgment may have to be used when selecting which data applies to making a design decision. Many theoretical stress concentration factors have been derived for infinite or semi-infinite geometries which may not be analyzable and are not testable in a stress lab, but tackling a problem using two or more of these approaches will allow an engineer to achieve an accurate conclusion.

The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] '''Civil Rights Division''' is the institution within the federal government responsible for enforcing federal statutes prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[racism|race]], [[sexism|sex]], disability, [[religious intolerance|religion]], and national origin. The Division was established on December 9, 1957, by order of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William P. Rogers]], after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] created the office of [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for Civil Rights, who has since then headed the division.  The head of the Civil Rights Division is an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights (AAG-CR) appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. The current AAG-CR is [[Eric Dreiband]].

[[File:William Hone by William Patten.jpg|right|thumb|William Hone by William Patten&lt;ref&gt;National Portrait Gallery, London&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''William Hone''' (3 June 1780 &amp;ndash; 8 November 1842) was an English writer, satirist and bookseller.  His victorious court battle against government censorship in 1817 marked a turning point in the fight for British [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hone, William |volume=12 |page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hone was born at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and had a strict religious upbringing. The only education he received was to be taught to read from the [[Bible]]. His father moved to London in 1783, and in 1790 Hone was placed in an attorney's office. After two-and-a-half years in the office of a solicitor at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] he returned to London to become clerk to a solicitor at [[Gray's Inn]]. But he disliked the [[law]], and had learned to think for himself. To the great concern of his father, he joined the [[London Corresponding Society]] in 1796, which campaigned to extend the vote to working men and was deeply unpopular with the government, who had tried to charge its leaders with treason.

Hone married in 1800, William and his wife Sarah had 12 children. He started a book and print shop with a [[circulating library]] in [[Lambeth|Lambeth Walk]]. He soon moved to [[St Martin-in-the-Fields|St Martin's Churchyard]], where he brought out his first publication, ''Shaw's Gardener'' (1806). It was at this time that he and his friend, John Bone, tried to establish a popular savings bank, and even spoke to the [[President of the Board of Trade]] about the project; they were unsuccessful. Bone then joined Hone in a bookseller's business; but [[bankruptcy]] was the result.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1811, Hone was employed by the booksellers as [[auctioneer]] to the trade, and had an office in Ivy Lane. Independent investigations carried on by him into the condition of [[lunatic asylum]]s led again to business difficulties and failure, but he took a small lodging in the [[Old Bailey]], keeping himself and his now large family by contributions to magazines and reviews. He hired a small shop, or rather box, in [[Fleet Street]] but this was twice robbed, and valuable books lent for show were stolen. In 1815 he started the ''Traveller'' newspaper, and tried in vain to save [[Elizabeth Fenning]], a cook convicted on thin evidence of poisoning her employers with arsenic.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Although Fenning was executed, Hone's 240 page book on the subject, ''The Important Results of an Elaborate Investigation into the Mysterious Case of Eliza Fenning'' — a landmark in investigative journalism – demolished the prosecution's case.{ The Laughter of Triumph by Ben Wilson. Pub. 2005 by Faber  &amp; Faber}
[[File:1819 Prince Regent G Cruikshank caricature.png|thumb|right|150px|An unflattering 1819 caricature of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] by [[George Cruikshank]], illustrating "The Political House that Jack Built".]]
From 1 February to 25 October 1817, Hone published the ''Reformists' Register'', using it to criticise state abuses, which he later attacked in the famous political squibs and parodies, illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]]. In April 1817 three ex-officio informations were filed against him by the attorney-general, [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]]. Three separate trials took place in the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] before special juries on 18, 19 and 20 December 1817. The first, for publishing ''The Late John Wilkes's Catechism of a Ministerial Member'' (1817), was before [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Mr Justice Abbot]] (afterwards Lord Tenterden); the second, for [[parody]]ing the litany and libelling the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] in ''The Political Litany'' (1817), and the third, for publishing the ''Sinecurist's Creed'' (1817), a parody on the [[Athanasian Creed]], were before [[Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Hone page.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Every Day Book'', typical page format, content and illustration. (1830 printing).]]
The prosecution took the ground that the prints were harmful to public morals and brought the prayer-book and even religion itself into contempt. The real motives of the prosecution were political: Hone had ridiculed the habits and exposed the corruption of those in power. He went to the root of the matter when he wished the jury "to understand that, had he been a publisher of ministerial parodies, he would not then have been defending himself on the floor of that court." In spite of illness and exhaustion Hone spoke on each of the three days for about seven hours. Although his judges were biased against him, he was acquitted on each count, and the result was received enthusiastically by immense crowds inside and outside the court.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Soon afterwards, a public collection was made on his behalf.

Among Hone's most successful political [[satire]]s were ''The Political house that Jack built'' (1819), ''The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder'' (1820), ''Ill favour of [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]]'', ''The Man in the Moon'' (1820) and ''The Political Showman'' (1821), all illustrated by Cruikshank. Many of his squibs are directed against a certain "Dr Slop", a nickname given by him to [[John Stoddart|Dr (afterwards Sir John) Stoddart]], publisher of ''[[The Times]]''. In researches for his defence he had come upon some curious and at that time little trodden literary ground, and the results were shown by his publication in 1820 of his ''Apocryphal New Testament'', and in 1823 of his ''Ancient Mysteries Explained''. In 1826 he published the ''Every-day Book'', in 1827-1828 the ''Table-Book'', and in 1829 the ''Year-Book''. All three were collections of curious information on manners, antiquities and various other subjects.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

These are the works by which Hone is best remembered. In preparing them he had the approval of [[Robert Southey]] and the assistance of [[Charles Lamb]], but they were not financially successful, and Hone was lodged in [[King's Bench Prison]] for debt. Friends, however, again came to his assistance, and he was established in a [[coffeehouse]] in [[Gracechurch Street]]; but this, like most of his business enterprises, ended in failure. Hone's attitude of mind had gradually changed to that of extreme devoutness, and during the latter years of his life, he became a follower of Rev. [[Thomas Binney]] and preached in Binney's [[Weigh House Chapel]], [[Eastcheap]]. In 1830 he edited [[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Strutt]]'s ''Sports and Pastimes of the people of England'', and he contributed to the first number of ''[[The Penny Magazine]]''. He was also for some years sub-editor of ''The Patriot''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He died at [[Tottenham]] and is buried at Dr Watts' Walk in [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington]].

A short biography of Hone's life written by his friend and sometime neighbor, [[Frances Rolleston]], was published five years after his death, a revised edition six years later, under the title ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c5gxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=some+account+of+the+conversion+from+atheism+to+christianity+of+the+late&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A-ztNBSJDr&amp;sig=eOVccNlGVbcmlMUPl2gSINLQInA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG2MKd_MHJAhUU1GMKHZU4A2EQ6AEIIjAB#v=on Some Account of the Conversion from Atheism to Christianity of the Late William Hone]''.

'''Ziran''' is a key concept in [[Daoism]] that literally means "self so; so of its own; so of itself" and thus "naturally; natural; spontaneously; freely; in the course of events; of course; doubtlessly". &lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, Edward G. (2003). ''Effortless action: Wu-wei as conceptual metaphor and spiritual ideal in early China''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513899-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Karyn. ''Learning from Chinese Philosophies: Ethics of Interdependent And Contextualised Self.'' Ashgate World Philosophies Series. {{ISBN|0-7546-3382-9}}. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This Chinese word is a two-character [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''zi'' (自) "nose; self; oneself; from; since" and ''ran'' (然) "right; correct; so; yes", which is used as a ''-ran'' [[suffix]] marking [[adjective]]s or [[adverb]]s (roughly corresponding to English ''-ly''). In Chinese culture, the nose (or zi) is a common metaphor for a person's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, W. A. (1989). "A Linguistic Interpretation of Discourse and Perspective in Daoism", ''Philosophy East and West'' 39(2), 171-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word 'ziran' first occurs in the [[Daodejing]] (17, 23, 25, 51) and refers to the structure of [[Tao|Dao]], which cannot be referred back to anything else. It is generally accepted that the philosopher [[Laozi]], author of the Daodejing, coined the term. Ziran is a central concept of Daoism, closely tied to the practice of [[Wu wei|wuwei]], detached or effortless action. Ziran refers to a state of "as-it-isness,"&lt;ref&gt;Fu, C. W. (2000). "Lao Tzu's Conception of Tao", in B. Gupta &amp; J. N. Mohanty (Eds.) ''Philosophical Questions East and West'' (pp. 46–62). Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important quality for anyone following Daoist beliefs. To become nearer to a state of ziran, one must become separate from unnatural influences and returned to an entirely natural, spontaneous state. Ziran is related to developing an "altered sense of human nature and of nature per se".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David L. (1987). "On Seeking a Change of Environment: A Quasi-Taoist. Philosophy", ''Philosophy East and West'' 37(2), 160-171&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sensibility of Taoism, the moral import can be most found in ziran.

==Recent reinterpretation==
Ziran has been interpreted and reinterpreted in a great number of ways over time. Most commonly it has been seen as a model that was followed by the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and Man in turn, based on the traditional translation and interpretation of Chapter 25 of the Daodejing. Wang's more modern translation eliminates the logical flaw that arises when one considers that to model oneself after another entity may be to become less natural, to lose the 'as-it-isness' that ziran refers to. Wang reinterprets the words of Chapter 25 to be instructions to follow the model set by Earth's being Earth, by Heaven's being Heaven, and by the Dao being the Dao; each behaving perfectly in accordance with ziran. This interpretation reaffirms that the base nature of the Dao is one of complete naturalness.&lt;ref name="Wang 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confuchina.com/05%20zongjiao/Lao%20Zi's%20Concept%20of%20Zi%20Ran.htm|title="It-self-so-ing" and "Other-ing" in Lao Zi's Concept of Zi Ran|last=Wang|first=Qingjie James|date=25 January 2003|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence by Ziran==
Wing-Chuek Chan provides another translation of 'ziran:' "It is so by virtue of its own".&lt;ref name="Chan 2005"&gt;Chan, Wing-Chuek (2005). "On Heidegger's Interpretation of Aristotle: A Chinese Perspective", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' 32(4),  539-557.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings up ziran's link to another Daoist belief, specifically that the myriad things exist because of the qualities that they possess, not because they were created by any being to fulfill a purpose or goal. The only thing that a being must be when it exists in accordance with ziran is ultimately natural, unaffected by artificial influences.

==Additional information==
Ziran and Tianran are related concepts. Tianran refers to a thing created by heaven that is ultimately untouched by human influence, a thing fully characterized by ziran. The two terms are sometimes interchangeably used.&lt;ref name="Chan 2005" /&gt; It can be said that by gaining ziran, a person grows nearer to a state of tianran.

Ziran can also be looked at from under Buddha's influence, "non-substantial". It is then believed to mean 'having no nature of its own'.&lt;ref&gt;Pregadio, Fabrizio. ed. (2008). ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'' M-Z Vol 2. Routledge. pg. 1302&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect it is seen as a synonym of real emptiness.

D. T. Suzuki, in a brief article penned in 1959, makes the suggestion of ''ziran'' as an aesthetic of action: "Living is an act of creativity demonstrating itself. Creativity is objectively seen as necessity, but from the inner point of view of Emptiness it is 'just-so-ness,' (ziran). It literally means 'byitself-so-ness,' implying more inner meaning than 'spontaneity' or 'naturalness'".&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D. T. (1959). "Basic Thoughts Underlying Eastern Ethical and Social Practice." ''Philosophy East and West'' 9(1/2) Preliminary Report on the Third East-West Philosophers' Conference. (April-July, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
