      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16583">The '''2010 gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas''' were a series of acts of [[sexual violence]] committed by a group of adult men and teenage boys on an [[Minor (law)#United States|underage]] girl in the town of [[ Cleveland, Texas|Cleveland]], in [[Texas]], USA.
==Background==
The victim was the 11-year old daughter of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], living in [[Cleveland, Texas]], a "timber town"&lt;ref name=worst&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarboe Russell|first1=Jan|date=July 2011 |title=The Worst Hard Time |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-worst-hard-time/ |dead-url=no |work=[[Texas Monthly]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of about nine thousand people in the  [[Greater Houston]] metropolitan area and [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty&amp;nbsp;County]]. Her father was a former [[construction worker]], unemployed at the time for a year and a half because of a back injury, while her mother was working making change in a [[Slot machine|slot game room]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The group of perpetrators included students at the local high school, two of whom were members of the basketball team and one the son of a school-board member, and persons with [[criminal record]]s, from [[Recreational drug use|selling drug]]s to [[robbery]] and, in one case, [[manslaughter]]. They ranged from [[Middle_school#United_States|middle school]]ers to one 27-year-old, at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C. |date=8 March 2011 |title=Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?hp |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Discovery==
On the Monday after [[Thanksgiving]] day, on 29 November 2010, a [[cell phone]] [[video clip]] with images of the sexual encounter between a group of males and a young female circulated in the cafeteria of Cleveland's high school. Some viewers recognized the girl as a [[Sixth grade#United States|6th grade]]r from the middle school next door.&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobie|first1=Kathie |date=6 September 2011 |title=The Girl from Trails End|url=https://www.gq.com/story/texas-gang-rape-11-year-old-girl-story|dead-url=no |work=[[GQ]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of the girl told a teacher what he had seen in the cell-phone video, as a school-district spokeswoman subsequently stated, and the police were alerted.&lt;ref name=sloppy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams|first1=Mary Elizabeth |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ sloppy, slanted child rape story |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/new_york_times_blames_11_year_old_rape_victim/|dead-url=no |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Investigation==
Police investigators identified and contacted the girl, whereupon she stated that, over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday break, she was raped by a group of young men first at a house and then in a [[mobile home]]. According to a [[search warrant]] [[affidavit]] obtained by the media, police determined the video clip was recorded inside an abandoned mobile home on the city's northern outskirts, next to a [[Baptist church]].&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the subsequent, criminal [[indictment]]s, the girl was assaulted on four separate occasions: the first in September, followed by three more throughout the fall of 2010. In January 2011, she was removed by [[social worker]]s from her parents' home and taken to [[foster care]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The investigation stirred [[Racism in the United States|racial tensions]] on account of the defendants all being [[African-American]]s and the girl [[Hispanic]],&lt;ref name=period&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica |date=18 March 2011 |title=Texas Girl Allegedly Gang Raped Over Three Month Period |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-texas-girl-allegedly-raped-multiple-times-court/story?id=13167326|work=[[ABC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the town and nationwide.&lt;ref name=appear&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez|first1=Edecio |date=5 April 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas gang rape suspects appear in court |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cleveland-texas-gang-rape-suspects-appear-in-court/|work=[[CBS News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was publicized nationwide in the States and also abroad.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vely|first1=Yannick|date=9 March 2011 |title=Le Viol Collectif qui choque l’Amérique|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Le-viol-collectif-qui-choque-l-Amerique-146689|dead-url=no|language=French|trans-title=The Gang Rape that shocked America |work=[[Paris Match]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|author-link=Hadley Freeman|date=3 September 2013 |title=The painful lesson of the Cherice Moralez rape trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/03/painful-lesson-cherice-moralez-rape|dead-url=no |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 4 April 2011,  nineteen defendants appeared in the court of [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty County]] district judge Mark Morefield for their [[arraignment]] hearing, with six of them pleading "not guilty."&lt;ref name=appear/&gt;

==Support for the accused==
The ''[[New York Times]]''' first report&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt; focused on the impact of the crime on the Cleveland community.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the 8 March NYT article, a hospital worker, who said she knew several of the defendants, was quoted: “It’s just destroyed our community. These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.” Also quoted was the spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District: “It’s devastating, and it’s really tearing our community apart. I really wish that this could end in a better light.” There were also quotes from local people who questioned the attitude of the victim's family, such as a neighbor of her parents: "Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?”&lt;/ref&gt; The report came under criticism for its alleged "sympathy" for the accused,&lt;ref name=mj&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCleland|first1=Mac |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ Rape-Friendly Reporting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/new-york-times-texas-rape/|dead-url=no |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amira|first1=Dan |date=11 March 2011 |title=A Lot of People in Cleveland, Texas, Blame 11-Year-Old for Being Raped|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] ''magazine'' |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cobb|first1= William Jelani|author-link=William Jelani Cobb|date=29 March 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas and Gender Jim Crow |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The Nation]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where the newspaper sent another reporter back at the place&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brisbane|first1=Arthur S.|date=11 March 2011 |title=Gang Rape Story Lacked Balance |url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/gang-rape-story-lacked-balance/?smid=fb-nytimes|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a self-critical article.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 11 March NYT article stated: "The outrage [against the previous NYT report] is understandable. The story dealt with a hideous crime but addressed concerns about the ruined lives of the perpetrators without acknowledging the obvious: concern for the victim. While the story appeared to focus on the community’s reaction to the crime, it was not enough to simply report that the community is principally concerned about the boys and men involved – as this story seems to do. If indeed that is the only sentiment to be found in this community...it becomes important to report... as well [of] voices of professional authorities or dissenting community members who will at least address, and not ignore, the plight of the young girl involved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quanell X]], [[community leader]] and head of the [[New Black Panthers]], was an "outspoken critic" of the  victim. In a [[press conference]] in front of a Cleveland church, he [[rhetorical question|asked rhetorically]] where the girl's parents were when this happened and why was "that child experiencing so much sex with so many African-American men." He also disputed the rape claims since, as he put it, the girl never actually yelled the word "rape" during the assault and did not make an "outcry" until after footage of the assault surfaced.&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the ''[[Houston Press]]'' 2014 report, Quanell X  claimed the investigation into the rape was being "run by the [[KKK]]" and stated to the [[African American]] community of the town: "We do not want someone with a malicious, racist motive to rid your community of an entire generation of black men."&lt;/ref&gt; The media reported that the audience "cheered and hollered in agreement."&lt;ref name=cheered&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leicht|first1=Angelica|date=19 December 2014 |title=Why Does Quanell X Support Some Rape Victims But Shame Others?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Press]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] [[Kathleen Passidomo]] proposed that the state should step in and regulate the wardrobe of young girls.&lt;ref name=pasidomo&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linkins|first1=Jason|date=13 March 2011 |title=In Wake Of Texas Gang Rape, Florida Lawmaker Proposes School Dress Code Legislation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/texas-gang-rape-aftermath-florida-law_n_836841.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Huffington Post]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasidomo referred to "an article about an 11 year old girl who was gang-raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old [[prostitute]].”&lt;ref group=note&gt;Passidomo claimed that "it’s incumbent upon [the state] to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire, so what happened in Texas doesn’t happen to [Florida's] students.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
In Texas, [[sexual assault]] against a [[Minor (law)#United States|person under 17 years of age]] is a second degree [[felony]], and [[aggravated sexual assault]] a first degree felony.&lt;ref name=texaslaw&gt;{{cite web |url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm|title=Penal Code - Title 5, Chapter 22: Assaultive Offenses|publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |date=October 2017 |website=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, twenty-one persons were charged with crimes related to the gang rape.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news |date=21 September 2012 |title=Texas: Four Get 15-Year Sentences in Gang Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/us/four-sentenced-in-gang-rape-of-11-year-old-texas-girl.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=Associated Press|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two adult males requested trials, and juries handed each defendant a 99-year prison sentence. Eleven other adult males pleaded guilty to the charges against them and received 15-year sentences in exchange. All seven juveniles entered guilty pleas and received seven-year [[Probation|probated prison-sentences]].&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=11 October 2013|title=21st assailant sentenced in Cleveland gang rape|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/21st-assailant-sentenced-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-4889262.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-first and last defendant pleaded guilty after a year long investigation whereby a [[DNA profiling|DNA specimen]] identified him as being at the [[crime scene]]. The defendant received a reduced seven-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to [[Indecent exposure|indecently exposing]] himself to a child. All defendants sentenced to prison would be [[Sex offender registry|registered]] as [[sex offender]]s for ten years after completing the sentence.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;

==Aftermath==
When the investigation started, the victim's family moved to another town after police detectives told the parents that they were in danger,&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|last2=Goode|first2=Erica |date=28 March 2011 |title=3-Month Nightmare Emerges in Rape Inquiry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29texas.html |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the  girl who was reported as raped was placed by the [[Child Protective Services]] in the care of the Girls' Haven in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. In December 2011, she ran away from the residential facility and was "on the streets for about a week," as the [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] prosecutor stated. He revealed that, at some point, she met a 30-year-old male with a prior conviction as a drug dealer in [[Fort Bend County]], who subsequently assaulted her at his apartment in Beaumont. The assailant was arrested and pleaded guilty in September 2012 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in exchange for deferred [[probation]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=29 December 2012|title=Defendant in Cleveland gang rape case gets life sentence|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Defendant-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-case-gets-life-4073766.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the girl revealed she was pregnant, allegedly from her "15-year old boyfriend," and that they would keep the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=   |date=22 May 2013|title=Girl, 14, now pregnant — was victim at age 11 of repeated gang rape|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/girl-14-pregnant-victim-age-11-repeated-gang-rape-article-1.1351930|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Daily News]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abhava''' means [[non-existence]], [[negation]], [[nothing]] or absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the negative of Bhava which means being, becoming, existing or appearance.

==Overview==
Uddayana divides ''[[Padārtha]]'' (Categories) into ''[[Bhava]]'' ([[existence]]) which is real, and ''Abhava'' ([[non-existence]]) which is not real. ''[[Dravya]]'' ([[Matter|substance]]), ''[[Guṇa]]'' (quality), ''[[Karma]]'' ([[Social actions|action]]), ''Samanya'' (community or generality), ''Visesa'' (particularity or partimerity) and ''Samavaya'' ([[inherence]]) are the marks of existence. ''Abhava'' has not been categorically defined by the [[Vaisheshika]] School of [[Hindu philosophy]] but is of four kinds viz – 1) ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, 2) ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e. Posterior non-existence, 3) ''Atyantabhava'' i.e.  Absolute non-existence, and 4) ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence.

# ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect in its material cause before production; it has a beginning it has an end because it is destroyed by the production of the effect. Without prior non-existence there cannot be an effect.
# ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e.Posterior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect by its destruction; as such it has a beginning but no end i.e. it cannot be destroyed.
# ''Atyantabhava'' i.e. Absolute non-existence, or absolute negation is non-existence in all times i.e. denial of an absolutely non-existent entity in all times and in all places. It is the state of absolute abstraction.
# ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence, is denial of identity between two things, which have specific nature. [[Negation]] other than mutual negation is negation of relation.

The process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the [[Rigveda]], ''Agnim'', is ''Pradhvamsabhava'', the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is ''Atyantabhava'', the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'', and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e. emergence of the following syllable, is ''Pragabhava''; this mechanism is inherent in both syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Plays about Famous Artists|author=Daniel Meyer Dinkgrafe|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|page=89|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wR50GEyHk-QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vaisheshika]], the [[Nyaya]], the Bhatta [[Mimamsa]] and [[Dvaita]] schools hold ''Abhava'' as a distinct category. Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school, ''Abhava'' is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with [[Moksha|Mukti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=abhava&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O8c7pBYtaP&amp;sig=BfLw4cirP6wV_7Rpusu11hE2MNM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9kInUe_KDsj5rAfSlYGwBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relative word, for there can be ''abhava'' only when previously there is ''bhava''; moreover it is an event occurring in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PrasannapadaE|author=Theodor Stcherbatsky|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTFXt6ZmVQC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjunian Disputations|author=Thomas E.

The acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition.

{{Other uses|Akashic records (disambiguation)}}
{{ref-improve|date=April 2018}}
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[anthroposophy]], the '''Akashic records''' are a [[compendium]] of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. They are believed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]] to be encoded in a non-physical [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] known as the [[etheric plane]]. There are [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] accounts but there is no scientific evidence for the existence of the Akashic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellwood |first= Robert S. |year=1996 |chapter= Theosophy |title= The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal |editor-last= Stein |editor-first= Gordon |editor-link= Gordon Stein |publisher= Prometheus Books |pages= 759–66 |isbn= 978-1-57392-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Regal |first= Brian |author-link= Brian Regal |year= 2009 |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood |page= 29 |isbn= 978-0-313-35507-3 |quote= Other than anecdotal eyewitness accounts, there is no evidence of the ability to astral project, the existence of other planes, or of the Akashic Record.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/121381643 | title=Heaven: The Rise of Modern Western Magic | publisher=Oxford University Press |last= Drury |first= Nevill | year=2011 | location=New York | pages=308 | isbn=978-0-19-975100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Akasha]]'' (''{{IAST|ākāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|आकाश}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] word for '[[Aether (classical element)|aether]]' or 'atmosphere'.

==Theosophical Society==
The Sanskrit term ''akasha'' was introduced to the language of theosophy through [[H. P. Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), who characterized it as a sort of life force; she also referred to "indestructible tablets of the astral light" recording both the past and future of human thought and action, but she did not use the term "akashic".&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Katharina|last1=Brandt|first2=Olav|last2=Hammer|chapter=Rudolf Steiner and Theosophy|title=Handbook of the Theosophical Current|editor1-first=Olav|editor1-last=Hammer|editor2-first=Mikael|editor2-last=Rothstein|location= Leiden, NL; Boston|publisher=Brill|year= 2013|pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=snZRetoB9yIC&amp;pg=PA122 122–3] |isbn= 9789004235960 |ref={{Harvid|Hammer &amp; Rothstein|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The notion of an akashic ''record'' was further disseminated by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in his book [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883) when he cites [[Henry Steel Olcott]]'s ''A Buddhist Catechism'' (1881).&lt;ref name="esoteric.buddhism"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred Percy|last=Sinnett|title=Esoteric Buddhism|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A_4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=akasa|year=1884|edition=5th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olcott  wrote that "Buddha taught two things are eternal, viz, 'Akasa' and 'Nirvana': everything has come out of Akasa in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it, and, passes away. No thing ever comes out of nothing." Olcott further explains that "Early Buddhism, then, clearly held to a permanency of records in the Akasa and the potential capacity of man to read the same, when he was evoluted to the stage of true individual enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Olcott, Henry Steel. ''A Buddhist Catechism''. London: Allen Scott and Company, 1881. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 51–2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[C. W. Leadbeater]]'s [[C. W. Leadbeater#Clairvoyance|''Clairvoyance'']] (1899) the association of the term with the idea was complete, and he identified the akashic records by name as something a [[clairvoyant]] could read.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt; 
In his 1913 ''[[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'']]'',  Leadbeater claims to record the history of [[Atlantis]] and other civilizations as well as the future society of [[Earth]] in the 28th century.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Besant |first1= Annie |last2= Leadbeater |first2= C.W. |title= Man: How, Whence, and Whither? |location= Adyar, India |year= 1913 |publisher= Theosophical Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote in her book ''Light of the Soul'' on ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Book 3 – Union achieved and its Results'' (1927): {{quote|The akashic record is like an immense photographic film, registering all the desires and earth experiences of our planet. Those who perceive it will see pictured thereon: The life experiences of every human being since time began, the reactions to experience of the entire animal kingdom, the aggregation of the thought-forms of a [[karma|karmic nature]] (based on desire) of every human unit throughout time. Herein lies the great deception of the records. Only a trained occultist can distinguish between actual experience and those astral pictures created by imagination and keen desire.}}

==Rudolf Steiner==
The [[Austrian people|Austrian]] theosophist and later founder of [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], used the Akashic records concept mainly in a series of articles in his journal ''[[Lucifer-Gnosis]]'' from 1904 to 1908, where he wrote about [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], topics related to their purported history and civilisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Aus der Akasha-Chronik''. Partial edition of the work in English:
{{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= The Submerged Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Their History and Civilization. Being Chapters From The Âkâshic Records |location= [[London]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1911}} First complete English edition: {{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= Cosmic Memory |location= [[Englewood, New Jersey]] |publisher= Rudolf Steiner Publications |year= 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he used the term in the title of lectures on a ''Fifth [[Gospel]]'' held in 1913 and 1914, shortly after the foundation of the [[Anthroposophical Society]] and Steiner's exclusion from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= The Fifth Gospel. Investigation of the Akasha Chronicle. Five lectures given in Christiania, 1913 |location= London |publisher= Rudolf Steiner Publishing |year= 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquarian Gospel==
[[Levi H. Dowling]]'s ''[[The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ|Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' (1908) offers a version of the youth of [[Jesus Christ]] ostensibly based upon "akashic record" material.

== Popular culture ==
References to the ''Akashic Records'' can be found in few fantasy fictions like "[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32953267-evolv EvOLv]" by Ryan Sequeira and "[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36982571-keepers-of-the-kalachakra Keepers of the Kalachakra]" by [[Ashwin Sanghi]].

===Voting rights activism in Alabama===
Traditionally, white voters in the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] region of Alabama had taken advantage of absentee ballots to retain control of elected offices; even with the increased registration of black voters, white absentee nonresident voters would vote in local elections at the behest of resident relatives and friends.&lt;ref name="SC-850304" /&gt; [[Wilcox County, Alabama|Wilcox County]] Commissioner Bobby Joe Johnson joked, "Do you know why the roads to white folks' cemeteries are paved in the Black Belt? It's so people won't get their feet wet if it rains on election day."&lt;ref name="SC-850506" /&gt; Despite complaints of fraud, election officials failed to obtain any indictments for absentee voter fraud.&lt;ref name="SC-850304" /&gt; When Turner went to Washington D.C. to complain about fraud to lawyers at the Justice Department, he was told the government "[couldn't] do anything ... Y'all need to learn to use the absentee-ballot process yourselves."&lt;ref name="NYTM-Bazelon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/magazine/the-voter-fraud-case-jeff-sessions-lost-and-cant-escape.html|title=The Voter Fraud Case Jeff Sessions Lost and Can't Escape|date=9 January 2017|author=Bazelon, Emily|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry County]] and the other counties forming the Black Belt, initially named for its soil,&lt;ref name="NYTM-Bazelon" /&gt; are some Alabama's poorest counties, and residents of the Black Belt typically travel out of their home counties for work, making it difficult to vote at local polls,&lt;ref name="SC-850304" /&gt; which were only open in Perry County for four hours in the afternoon.&lt;ref name="NYTM-Bazelon" /&gt; In addition, many potential black voters in the Black Belt are elderly and/or illiterate due to inferior education, again limiting poll access.&lt;ref name="SC-850304" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC-850506" /&gt; As a result, local civil rights organizations, including the Perry County Civic League (PCCL), began to register black voters for and assist them with absentee ballots.&lt;ref name="SC-850304" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC-850506" /&gt;

In 1979, Maggie Bozeman and Julia Wilder were convicted of absentee voter fraud in a 1978 election held in [[Pickens County, Alabama|Pickens County]].&lt;ref name=WaPo-820206&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/02/06/pickens-county-flare-up-the-story-of-2-blacks-found-guilty/5fdc01a5-35f2-46a7-94eb-01bba7e47418/ |title=Pickens County Flare-Up: The Story of 2 Blacks Found Guilty |author=Harris, Art |date=6 February 1982 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was reached by an all-white jury, and the pair were sentenced to four (Bozeman) and five (Wilder) years imprisonment, believed to be the strongest sentences handed out to-date for voting fraud in Alabama.&lt;ref name=WaPo-820206 /&gt; The conviction was later upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court before being overturned in federal court,&lt;ref name=SC-850304 /&gt; but the pair, known as the Carrollton Two, started to serve their sentences in January 1982&lt;ref name=WaPo-820206 /&gt; and were freed in November 1982 after spending 11 days in prison, with the balance of time served on work release in Tuskegee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/09/Carrollton-Two-freed/8914405666000/ |title='Carrollton Two' freed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=9 November 1982 |publisher=UPI |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial conviction, though, depressed black voter participation in Pickens County.&lt;ref name=SC-850304 /&gt;

=== The Marion Three ===

In mathematics '''Antoine's necklace''' is a topological embedding of the [[Cantor set]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, whose complement is not [[simply connected]]. It also serves as a counterexample to the claim that all [[Cantor space]]s are ambiently homeomorphic to each other. It was discovered by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink= Louis Antoine|last=Antoine|first=Louis|year=1921}}.

==Construction==

Antoine's necklace is constructed iteratively like so: Begin with a [[solid torus]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 0). Next, construct a "necklace" of smaller, linked tori that lie inside ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. This necklace is ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 1). Each torus composing ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be replaced with another smaller necklace as was done for ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing this yields ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 2).

This process can be repeated a countably infinite number of times to create an ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''n''. Antoine's necklace ''A'' is defined as the intersection of all the iterations.

==Properties==

Since the solid tori are chosen to become arbitrarily small as the iteration number increases, the connected components of ''A'' must be single points.  It is then easy to verify that ''A'' is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]], [[dense-in-itself]], and [[totally disconnected]], having the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. This is sufficient to conclude that as an abstract metric space ''A'' is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

However, as a subset of Euclidean space ''A'' is not ambiently homeomorphic to the standard Cantor set ''C'', embedded in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on a [[line segment]]. That is, there is no bi-continuous map from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that carries ''C'' onto ''A''. To show this, suppose there was such a map ''h'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and consider a loop ''k'' that is interlocked with the necklace. ''k'' cannot be continuously shrunk to a point without touching ''A'' because two loops cannot be continuously unlinked. Now consider any loop ''j'' disjoint from ''C''. ''j'' can be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'' because we can simply move it through the gap intervals. However, the loop ''g'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') is a loop that ''cannot'' be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'', which contradicts the previous statement. Therefore, ''h'' cannot exist.

Antoine's necklace was used by {{harvs|txt|last=Alexander|first=James Waddell|authorlink=James Waddell Alexander II|year=1924}} to construct '''Antoine's horned sphere''' (similar to but not the same as [[Alexander's horned sphere]]).

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H.

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has controversial applications in [[microeconomics]] ([[Pump and dump|pump and dump strategy]]) and [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strange|first1=Adario|title=Why Apple Loves Gold|url=http://mashable.com/2015/04/25/why-apple-loves-gold/|accessdate=September 11, 2015|publisher=Mashable|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trefis Team|title=Looking At The Significance Of Sirius XM's Latest $2 billion Share Repurchase Program|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/09/02/looking-at-the-significance-of-sirius-xms-latest-2-billion-share-repurchase-program/|accessdate=September 11, 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles of creating artificial demand can include [[mass media]] advertising, which can create demand for [[good (economics)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[policy|political policies]] or [[political platform|platforms]], and other entities.

Another example of artificial demand can be seen in [[penny stock]] [[Spam (e-mail)|spam]]. After purchasing a large number of shares of an extremely low-value stock, the spammer attempts to create artificial demand by implementing a spam-based [[guerrilla marketing]] strategy.

The '''Austin Museum of Digital Art''' ('''AMODA'''), located in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], is the first [[museum]] dedicated exclusively to the display of [[digital art]]. AMODA was founded in 1997 by Harold Chaput, Samantha Krukowski and Chris Rankin in response to the abundance of digital art in the local scene and the absence of venues for such art. AMODA has not only presented local artwork, but has brought digital art and digital artists from around the globe to Austin. By putting local and global works and acts next to each other, AMODA has contributed to the already growing digital art and music scene in Austin, while gaining recognition around the world as an important museum that has shaped the definition of digital art.

==History==
The Austin Museum of Digital Art is the brainchild of Harold Chaput, then a Computer Sciences doctoral student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and Christopher Rankin, an art history graduate of [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] and experienced museum worker. Rankin was dissatisfied with the state of the contemporary art scene in Austin. Chaput was connected to many artists and musicians employed in high tech positions who were looking for a creative outlet. By establishing an organization with the goals of supporting the production and exhibition of new work and encouraging discussion about the role of technology in current contemporary art, Chaput and Rankin hoped that they could encourage a community of artists, musicians, and technologists to create cutting-edge digital-based contemporary art.

They joined up with Samantha Krukowski, an influential member of UT's communications department. The three of them swiftly settled on a subsection of contemporary art that used computers in some form, and coined the term Digital Art to describe it. They also agreed that the new organization should be a museum rather than a collective or a gallery, placing the emphasis on artistry and aesthetics rather than fashion and popularity. Thus the Austin Museum of Digital Art was founded in November 1997.

Shortly after its founding, Rankin left AMODA because his new job working for the Texas Commission on the Arts posed a conflict of interest. Krukowski also left to become a Professor of Communications at UT. Rankin and Krukowski were replaced Kyle Anderson, Jennifer Potter, Joel Stearns and Robert Turknett. Together with Chaput, this board moved AMODA from a museum on paper to an art institution. They created AMODA's programs, including an educational program (2000), the Digital Showcase (2001), an exhibition series (2002), and a performance series (2003).

==Defining Digital Art==
AMODA defines Digital Art as art that uses digital technology in one of three ways: product, process or subject.

Art that uses digital technology as the product can be considered digital art. This includes categories like "web art" or "demo art." This is the most recognized definition of digital art.

Art that uses digital technology in the process of creation can also be considered digital art. The drawings of [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]] are digital art because a computer program was used to generate the works, even though the final product is ink on paper. Computer graphics on film, digital music, and the [[Cyberopera]] are all good examples of digital art as process.

Finally, art that references digital art as its subject can also be considered digital art. A series of oil paintings showing a man connected to an online chat room could be categorized as digital art, even though digital technology was never used in the creation or display of the work.

The central theme for all three approaches is: art that could not have been created without digital technology. All three address different facets of digital art, from presentation to technique to sociology, all of which are important to the history of art.

==Programming==
AMODA's programming was designed to be accessible without being condescending. It was unique in its ability to draw a younger audience than other museums and galleries could. AMODA's programs were integrated with the community and attracted a new population of art patrons through its non-traditional but high-quality presentation of digital art.

AMODA's most popular and successful programs were its Exhibition Series and Digital Showcase.

===Digital Showcase===
The AMODA Digital Showcase is a monthly evening of digital art and music. Under the strict direction of Todd Simmons, a performance space is filled with digital art installations, and four to six digital music performances are shown throughout the evening.

The intention of the Digital Showcase is to show digital art ''in situ''. While an exhibition removes art from its natural environment and displays it for isolated examination, the Digital Showcase lets the different art installations and music performances bleed over each other. The result is an immersive art experience where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is also wildly popular. Attendance is consistently in the hundreds, and the performances have been written up internationally.

'''Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen''' (b. 1943) is a researcher, therapist and educator in the field of [[somatics]]. She is most well known for being the originator of Body-Mind Centering. She is considered{{by whom|date=November 2018}} one of the major contributors in the 20th and 21st century to the field of movement studies and has been influential in body oriented psychotherapy, dance therapy, contemporary dance, yoga and manual bodywork.

==Early life and professional career==

According to her own biography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensing, Feeling and Action - the Experiential Anatomy of Body-Mind Centering|last=Bainbridge-Cohen|first=Bonnie|publisher=Contact Editions|year=2012|isbn=|location=Northampton MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen grew up in [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], her mother was an acrobat and her father a ticket seller. In 1959, aged 16, she participated in a high-school dance project with children with learning disabilities. This led her to study ocupational therapy at [[Ohio State University]].

Having danced since childhood, she maintained a strong connection to dance at this time and took classes with [[Marian Chace]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[dance therapy]], and summer schools with [[Erick Hawkins]], a prominent modern dancer.

Once she completed her studies, she began working in hospitals and started using principles from Hawkin’s dance technique, such as focusing on active lengthening of muscles, in rehabilitation work. This was a controversial choice with her supervisors but was the beginnings of her development of Body-Mind Centering.

Later she studied neurodevelopmental therapy with [[Bobath concept|Bertha and Dr. Karel Bobath]], [[Laban movement analysis]] with [[Irmgard Bartenieff]], Kestenberg movement profiling with [[Judith Kestenberg]], [[craniosacral therapy]] with John Upledger and [[ideokinesis]] with Barbara Clark and Andre Bernard.

When she completed her studies in neurodevelopmental therapy with the Bobaths, she moved to New York but did not find the hospital environment conducive to this way of working. She found that many of New York’s dancers were however very receptive and thus began adapting the work for adults without disabilities. Out of these classes grew, directly, what was later to become the School of Body-Mind Centering and the core material in the Body-Mind Centering curriculum was developed there.

==Body-Mind Centering==

Body-Mind Centering, the approach to somatic movement education and therapy developed by Bainbridge-Cohen, combines elements of movement analysis, re-education. 

The core areas of study in Body-Mind Centering include [[Experiential anatomy|embodied anatomy]], embodied [[developmental movement]] and somatic psychology.

'''Categorical perception'''  is a phenomenon of [[perception]] of distinct categories when there is a gradual change in a variable along a continuum. It was originally observed for auditory stimuli but now found to be applicable to other perceptual modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fugate Jennifer M.

==The motor theory of speech perception==
{{main|Motor theory of speech perception}}
And what about the very building blocks of the [[language]] we use to name categories: Are our speech-sounds —/ba/, /da/, /ga/ —innate or learned? The first question we must answer about them is whether they are categorical categories at all, or merely [[arbitrary]] points along a continuum. It turns out that if one analyzes the sound spectrogram of ba and pa, for example, both are found  to lie along an acoustic continuum called "voice-onset-time." With a technique similar to the one used in "morphing" visual images continuously into one another, it is possible to "morph" a /ba/ gradually into a /pa/ and beyond by gradually increasing the voicing [[parameter]].

[[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A. M., Harris, K. S., Hoffman, H. S. &amp; Griffith, B. C. |year=1957 |title=The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phoneme boundaries |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=54 |pages=358–368 |doi=10.1037/h0044417 |pmid=13481283 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he did not talk about voice onset time in that paper) reported that when people listen to sounds that vary along the voicing continuum, they hear only /ba/s and /pa/s, nothing in between. This effect—in which a perceived quality jumps abruptly from one category to another at a certain point along a continuum, instead of changing gradually—he dubbed "categorical perception" (CP). He suggested that CP was unique to speech, that CP made speech special, and, in what came to be called "the motor theory of speech [[perception]]," he suggested that CP's explanation lay in the anatomy of speech production.

According to the (now abandoned) [[motor theory of speech perception]], the reason people perceive an abrupt change between /ba/ and /pa/ is that the way we hear speech sounds is influenced by how people produce them when they speak. What is varying along this continuum is voice-onset-time: the "b" in /ba/ is voiced and the "p" in /pa/ is not. But unlike the synthetic "morphing" apparatus, people's natural vocal apparatus is not capable of producing anything in between ba and pa. So when one hears a [[sound]] from the voicing continuum, their brain perceives it by trying to match it with what it would have had to do to produce it. Since the only thing they can produce is /ba/ or /pa/, they will perceive any of the synthetic stimuli along the continuum as either /ba/ or /pa/, whichever it is closer to. A similar CP effect is found with ba/da; these too lie along a continuum acoustically, but vocally, /ba/ is formed with the two lips, /da/ with the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, and our anatomy does not allow any intermediates.

The motor [[theory]] of speech perception explained how speech was special and why speech-sounds are perceived categorically: [[sensory perception]] is mediated by motor production. Wherever production is categorical, perception will be categorical; where production is continuous, perception will be continuous. And indeed vowel categories like a/u were found to be much less categorical than ba/pa or ba/da.

===Acquired distinctiveness===
If motor production mediates sensory [[perception]], then one assumes that this CP effect is a result of learning to produce [[Manner of articulation|speech]]. [[Peter D. Eimas|Eimas]] et al. (1971), however, found that [[infants]] already have speech CP before they begin to speak. Perhaps, then, it is an [[innate]] effect, evolved to "prepare" us to learn to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eimas, P.D. |author2=Siqueland, E.R. |author3=Jusczyk, P.W. |author4=Vigorito, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1971 |title=Speech perception in infants |journal=Science |volume=171 |pages=303–306 |doi=10.1126/science.171.3968.303 |pmid=5538846 |issue=3968}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Kuhl (1987) found that chinchillas also have "speech CP" even though they never learn to speak, and presumably did not evolve to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Kuhl, P. K. |year=1987 |title=The Special-Mechanisms Debate in Speech Perception: Nonhuman Species and Nonspeech Signals |editor=S. Harnad |encyclopedia=Categorical perception: The groundwork of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane (1965) went on to show that CP effects can be induced by [[learning]] alone, with a purely sensory (visual) continuum in which there is no motor production discontinuity to mediate the perceptual discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lane, H. |year=1965 |title=The motor theory of speech perception: A critical review |journal=Psychological Review |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=275–309 |doi=10.1037/h0021986 |pmid=14348425}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that speech CP is not special after all, but merely a special case of Lawrence's classic demonstration that stimuli to which you learn to make a different response become more distinctive and stimuli to which you learn to make the same response become more similar.

It also became clear that CP was not quite the all-or-none effect Liberman had originally thought it was: It is not that all /pa/s are indistinguishable and all /ba/s are indistinguishable: We can hear the differences, just as we can see the differences between different shades of red. It is just that the within-category differences (pa1/pa2 or red1/red2) sound/look much smaller than the between-category differences (pa2/ba1 or red2/yellow1), even when the size of the underlying physical differences (voicing, wavelength) are actually the same.

== Identification and discrimination tasks ==
The study of categorical perception often uses experiments involving discrimination and identification tasks in order to categorize participants' perceptions of sounds.  [[Voice-onset time|Voice onset time]] (VOT) is measured along a continuum rather than a binary.  English bilabial stops /b/ and /p/ are voiced and voiceless counterparts of the same place and manner of articulation, yet native speakers distinguish the sounds primarily by where they fall on the VOT continuum.  Participants in these experiments establish clear [[phoneme]] boundaries on the continuum; two sounds with different VOT will be perceived as the same phoneme if on the same side of the boundary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|last=Fernández|first=Eva|last2=Cairns|first2=Helen|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0|location=West Sussex, United Kingdom|pages=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants take longer to discriminate between two sounds falling in the same category of VOT than between two on opposite sides of the phoneme boundary, even if the difference in VOT is greater between the two in the same category.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Repp|first=Bruno|date=1984|title=Categorical Perception: Issues, Methods, Findings|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0443.pdf|journal=SPEECH AND LANGUAGE: Advances in Basic Research and Practice|volume=10|pages=243–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification ===
In a categorical perception identification task, participants often must identify stimuli, such as speech sounds.  An experimenter testing the perception of the VOT boundary between  /p/ and /b/ may play several sounds falling on various parts of the VOT continuum and ask volunteers whether they hear each sound as /p/ or /b/.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Jason|last2=Rosen|first2=Jeffrey|date=1980|title=Auditory Phonemic Perception in Dyslexia: Categorical Identification and Discrimination of Stop Consonants|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0093934X80901522/1-s2.0-0093934X80901522-main.pdf?_tid=a344053c-2794-11e7-a156-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1492890680_73e3ee524cc22d1289832b0032a43f19|journal=Brain and Language|volume=9|pages=324–337|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(80)90152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such experiments, sounds on one side of the boundary are heard almost universally as /p/ and on the other as /b/.  Stimuli on or near the boundary take longer to identify and are reported differently by different volunteers, but are perceived as either /b/ or /p/, rather than as a sound somewhere in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Discrimination ===
A simple AB discrimination task presents participants with two options and participants must decide if they are identical.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Predictions for a discrimination task in an experiment are often based on the preceding identification task.  An ideal discrimination experiment validating categorical perception of stop consonants would result in volunteers more often correctly discriminating stimuli that fall on opposite sides of the boundary, while discriminating at chance level on the same side of the boundary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In an ABX discrimination task, volunteers are presented with three stimuli.  A and B must be distinct stimuli and volunteers decide which of the two the third stimulus X matches.  This discrimination task is much more common than a simple AB task.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The Whorf hypothesis==
According to the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] (of which Lawrence's acquired similarity/distinctiveness effects would simply be a special case), language affects the way that people perceive the world. For example, colors are perceived categorically only because they happen to be named categorically: Our subdivisions of the [[spectrum]] are [[arbitrary]], learned, and vary across [[cultures]] and [[language]]s. But Berlin &amp; Kay (1969) suggested that this was not so: Not only do most cultures and languages subdivide and name the [[color spectrum]] the same way, but even for those who don't, the regions of compression and separation are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berlin, B.  |author2=Kay, P. |year=1969 |title=Basic color terms: Their universality and evolution. |publisher=Berkeley: [[University of California]] Press |isbn=1-57586-162-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; We all see blues as more alike and greens as more alike, with a fuzzy boundary in between, whether or not we have named the difference. This view has been challenged in a review article by Regier and Kay (2009) who discuss a distinction between the questions "1. Do color terms affect color perception?" and "2. Are color categories determined by largely arbitrary linguistic convention?". They report evidence that linguistic categories, stored in the left hemisphere of the brain for most people, do affect categorical perception but primarily in the right-eye visual field, and that this effect is eliminated with a concurrent verbal interference task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Regier, T.  |author2=Kay, P. |year=2009 |title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=439–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001 |pmid=19716754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism, in contrasts to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, posits that perceptual categories are innate, and are unaffected by the language that one speaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistic relativity versus innate ideas: The origins of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in German thought.|last=Penn|first=Julia, M.|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===

Support of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis describes instances in which speakers of one language demonstrate categorical perception in a way that is different from speakers of another language. Examples of such evidence are provided below:

Regier and Kay (2009) reported evidence that linguistic categories affect categorical perception primarily in the right-eye visual field.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=13|issue=10|pages=439–447|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001|pmid=19716754|author1=Regier, T.|author2=Kay, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-eye visual field is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, which also controls language faculties. Davidoff (2001) presented evidence that in color discrimination tasks, native English speakers discriminated easier between color stimuli across a determined blue-green boundary than within the same side, but did not show CP when given the same task with Berinmo "nol" and "wor"; Berinmo speakers performed oppositely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Jules|date=September 2001|title=Language and perceptual categorisation|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1364661300017265/1-s2.0-S1364661300017265-main.pdf?_tid=c110f2bc-2863-11e7-b4a7-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1492979636_b5ca81ccb343903518a491533a4e1091|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=5|pages=382–387|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01726-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular theory in current research is "weak-Whorfianism,' which is the theory that although there is a strong universal component to perception, cultural differences still have an impact. For example, a 1998 study found that while there was evidence of universal perception of color between speakers of Setswana and English, there were also marked differences between the two language groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies, I.R.L.; Sowden, P.T.; Jerrett, D.T.; Jerrett, T.; Corbett, G.G.|first=|date=1998|title=A cross-cultural study of English and Setswana speakers on a colour triads task: A test of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis|url=|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=89|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1998.tb02669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolved and learned CP ==

===Evolved CP===
First, back to [[vowels]]. The [[signature]] of CP is within-category compression and/or between-category separation. The size of the CP effect is merely a scaling factor; it is this compression/separation "accordion effect", that is CP's distinctive feature. In this respect, the "weaker" CP effect for vowels, whose motor production is continuous rather than categorical, but whose [[perception]] is by this criterion categorical, is every bit as much of a CP effect as the ba/pa and ba/da effects. But, as with colors, it looks as if the effect is an innate one: Our sensory category detectors for both color and speech sounds are born already "biased" by evolution: Our perceived color and speech-sound [[spectrum]] is already "warped" with these compression/separations.

===Learned CP===
The Lane/Lawrence demonstrations, lately replicated and extended by Goldstone (1994), showed that CP can be induced by learning alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone, R. L. |year=1994 |title=Influences of categorization on perceptual discrimination |series=General |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=178–200 |pmid=8014612| doi= 10.1037/0096-3445.123.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also the countless [[Categorization|categories]] cataloged in our dictionaries that, according to categorical perception, are unlikely to be inborn. Nativist theorists such as Fodor [1983] have sometimes seemed to suggest that all of our [[Categorization|categories]] are inborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fodor, J. |year=1983 |title=The modularity of mind |publisher=[[MIT]] Press |isbn=0-262-06084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are recent demonstrations that, although the primary color and speech categories may be inborn, their boundaries can be modified or even lost as a result of learning, and weaker secondary boundaries can be generated by learning alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberson, D., Davies, I. &amp; Davidoff, J. |year=2000 |title=Color categories are not universal: Replications and new evidence from a stone-age culture |series=General |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=369–398 |pmid=11006906 | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.129.3.369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of innate CP, our categorically biased [[Sensory receptor|sensory detectors]] pick out their prepared color and speech-sound categories far more readily and reliably than if our perception had been continuous.

Learning is a cognitive process that results in a relatively permanent change in behavior. Learning can influence perceptual processing.&lt;ref name=Notman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Notman|first=Leslie |author2=Paul Sowden |author3=Emre Ozgen|title=The Nature of Learned Categorical Perception Effects: A Psychophysical Approach|journal=Cognition|year=2005|volume=95|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.07.002|pages=B1–B14|pmid=15694641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning influences perceptual processing by altering the way in which an individual perceives a given stimulus based on prior experience or knowledge. This means that the way something is perceived is changed by how it was seen, observed, or experienced before. The effects of learning can be studied in categorical perception by looking at the processes involved.&lt;ref name=Casey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=Matthew|author2=Paul Sowden|title=Modeling learned categorical perception in human vision|journal=Neural Networks|year=2012|volume=33|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2012.05.001|pages=114–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learned categorical perception can be divided into different processes through some comparisons. The processes can be divided into between category and within category groups of comparison
.&lt;ref name=Foroni&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foroni|first=Francesco|author2=Myron Rothbart|title=Category Boundaries and Category Labels: When Does a Category Name Influence the Perceived Similarity of Category Members|journal=Social Cognition|year=2011|volume=29|issue=5|pages=547–576|doi=10.1521/soco.2011.29.5.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between category groups are those that compare between two separate sets of objects. Within category groups are those that compare within one set of objects. Between subjects comparisons lead to a categorical expansion effect. A categorical expansion occurs when the classifications and boundaries for the category become broader, encompassing a larger set of objects. In other words, a categorical expansion is when the "edge lines" for defining a category become wider. Within subjects comparisons lead to a categorical compression effect. A categorical compression effect corresponds to the narrowing of category boundaries to include a smaller set of objects (the "edge lines" are closer together).&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt; Therefore, between category groups lead to less rigid group definitions whereas within category groups lead to more rigid definitions.

Another method of comparison is to look at both supervised and unsupervised group comparisons. Supervised groups are those for which categories have been provided, meaning that the category has been defined previously or given a label; unsupervised groups are groups for which categories are created, meaning that the categories will be defined as needed and are not labeled.&lt;ref name=Clapper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clapper|first=John|title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge on Incidental Category Learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0028457|volume=38|pages=1558–1577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying learned categorical perception, themes are important. Learning categories is influenced by the presence of themes. Themes increase quality of learning. This is seen especially in cases where the existing themes are opposite.&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt;  In learned categorical perception, themes serve as cues for different categories. They assist in designating what to look for when placing objects into their categories. For example, when perceiving shapes, angles are a theme. The number of angles and their size provide more information about the shape and cue different categories. Three angles would cue a triangle, whereas four might cue a rectangle or a square. Opposite to the theme of angles would be the theme of circularity. The stark contrast between the sharp contour of an angle and the round curvature of a circle make it easier to learn.

Similar to themes, labels are also important to learned categorical perception.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;  Labels are “noun-like” titles that can encourage categorical processing with a focus on similarities.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt; The strength of a label can be determined by three factors: analysis of affective (or emotional) strength, permeability (the ability to break through) of boundaries, and a judgment (measurement of rigidity) of discreteness.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;   Sources of labels differ, and, similar to unsupervised/supervised categories, are either created or already exist.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt; Labels affect perception regardless of their source. Peers, individuals, experts, cultures, and communities can create labels. The source doesn’t appear to matter as much as mere presence of a label, what matters is that there is a label. There is a positive correlation between strength of the label (combination of three factors) and the degree to which the label affects perception, meaning that the stronger the label, the more the label affects perception.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;

Cues used in learned categorical perception can foster easier recall and access of prior knowledge in the process of learning and using categories.&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt;  An item in a category can be easier to recall if the category has a cue for the memory.  As discussed, labels and themes both function as cues for categories, and, therefore, aid in the memory of these categories and the features of the objects belonging to them.

There are several brain structures at work that promote learned categorical perception. The areas and structures involved include: neurons, the prefrontal cortex, and the inferotemporal cortex.&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt;&lt;ref name=Prather&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prather|first=Jonathan|author2=Stephen Nowicki|author3=Rindy Anderson|author4=Susan Peters|author5=Richard Mooney|title=Neural Correlates of Categorical Perception in Learned Vocal Communication|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1038/nn.2246|pages=221–228|pmid=19136972|pmc=2822723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons in general are linked to all processes in the brain and, therefore, facilitate learned categorical perception. They send the messages between brain areas and facilitate the visual and linguistic processing of the category. The prefrontal cortex is involved in “forming strong categorical representations.”&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt; The inferotemporal cortex has cells that code for different object categories and are turned along diagnostic category dimensions, areas distinguishing category boundaries.&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt;

The learning of categories and categorical perception can be improved through adding verbal labels, making themes relevant to the self, making more separate categories, and by targeting similar features that make it easier to form and define categories.

Learned categorical perception occurs not only in human species but has been demonstrated in animal species as well. Studies have targeted categorical perception using humans, monkeys, rodents, birds, frogs.&lt;ref name=Prather /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2006.08.005 |author1=Eriksson, Jan L.  |author2=Villa, Alessandro E.P. |year=2006 |title=Learning of auditory equivalence classes for vowels by rats |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=73 |pages=348–359 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635706001872 | issue=3 |pmid=16997507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have led to numerous discoveries. They focus primarily on learning the boundaries of categories, where inclusion begins and ends, and they support the hypothesis that categorical perception does have a learned component.

==Computational and neural models==

Computational modeling (Tijsseling &amp; Harnad 1997; Damper &amp; Harnad 2000) has shown that many types of category-learning mechanisms (e.g. both back-propagation and competitive networks) display CP-like effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/BF03206927 |author1=Damper, R.I.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=2000 |title=Neural Network Modeling of Categorical Perception |journal=Perception and Psychophysics |volume=62 |pages=843–867 |url=http://cogprints.org/1620/ | issue=4 |pmid=10883589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Tijsseling, A.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=1997 |title=Warping Similarity Space in Category Learning by Backprop Nets |editor=Ramscar, M. |editor2=Hahn, U. |editor3=Cambouropoulos, E. |editor4=Pain, H. |encyclopedia=Proceedings of SimCat 1997: Interdisciplinary Workshop on Similarity and Categorization |publisher=Department of Artificial Intelligence, Edinburgh University |pages=263–269 |url=http://cogprints.org/1608/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In back-propagation nets, the hidden-unit activation patterns that "represent" an input build up within-category compression and between-category separation as they learn; other kinds of nets display similar effects. CP seems to be a means to an end: Inputs that differ among themselves are "compressed" onto similar internal representations if they must all generate the same output; and they become more separate if they must generate different outputs. The network's "bias" is what filters inputs onto their correct output category. The nets accomplish this by selectively detecting (after much trial and error, guided by error-correcting feedback) the invariant features that are shared by the members of the same category and that reliably distinguish them from members of different categories; the nets learn to ignore all other variation as irrelevant to the [[categorization]].

==Brain basis==
Neural data provide correlates of CP and of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharma, A.  |author2=Dorman, M.F. |year=1999 |title=Cortical auditory evoked potential correlates of categorical perception of voice-onset time |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |pmid=10462812 |volume=106 |pages=1078–1083 |doi=10.1121/1.428048 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between event-related potentials recorded from the brain have been found to be correlated with differences in the perceived category of the stimulus viewed by the subject. [[Neural imaging]] studies have shown that these effects are localized and even lateralized to certain brain regions in subjects who have successfully learned the category, and are absent in subjects who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seger, Carol A. |author2=Poldrack, Russell A. |author3=Prabhakaran, Vivek |author4=Zhao, Margaret |author5=Glover, Gary H. |author6=Gabrieli, John D.

Categorical perception is identified with the left prefrontal cortex with this showing such perception for speech units while this is not by posterior areas earlier in their processing such as areas in the left [[superior temporal gyrus]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02380.x | last1 = Myers | first1 = EB | last2 = Blumstein | first2 = SE | last3 = Walsh | first3 = E | last4 = Eliassen | first4 = J. | last5 = Batton | year = 2009 | first5 = D | last6 = Kirk | first6 = JS | title = Inferior frontal regions underlie the perception of phonetic category invariance | url = | journal = Psychol Sci | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 895–903 | pmid = 19515116 | pmc = 2851201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language-induced==

Both innate and learned CP are sensorimotor effects: The compression/separation [[biases]] are sensorimotor biases, and presumably had sensorimotor origins, whether during the sensorimotor life-history of the [[organism]], in the case of learned CP, or the sensorimotor life-history of the species, in the case of innate CP. The [[neural net]] I/O models are also compatible with this fact: Their I/O biases derive from their I/O history. But when we look at our repertoire of [[Categorization|categories]] in a dictionary, it is highly unlikely that many of them had a direct sensorimotor history during our lifetimes, and even less likely in our ancestors' lifetimes. How many of us have seen a unicorn in real life? We have seen pictures of them, but what had those who first drew those pictures seen? And what about categories I cannot draw or see (or taste or touch): What about the most abstract categories, such as goodness and truth?

Some of our [[Categorization|categories]] must originate from another source than direct sensorimotor [[experience]], and here we return to language and the Whorf Hypothesis: Can categories, and their accompanying CP, be acquired through language alone? Again, there are some neural net simulation results suggesting that once a set of category names has been "grounded" through direct sensorimotor experience, they can be combined into Boolean combinations (man = male &amp; human) and into still higher-order [[combinations]] (bachelor = unmarried &amp; man) which not only pick out the more abstract, higher-order categories much the way the direct sensorimotor detectors do, but also inherit their CP effects, as well as generating some of their own. Bachelor inherits the compression/separation of unmarried and man, and adds a layer of separation/compression of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1075/eoc.4.1.07can |author1=Cangelosi, A.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=2001 |title=The Adaptive Advantage of Symbolic Theft Over Sensorimotor Toil: Grounding Language in Perceptual Categories. |journal=Evolution of Communication |volume=4 |pages=117–142 |url=http://cogprints.org/2036/ | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cangelosi A. |author2=Greco A. |author3=Harnad S. |year=2000 |title=From robotic toil to symbolic theft: Grounding transfer from entry-level to higher-level categories |journal=Connection Science |volume=12 |pages=143–162 |url=http://cogprints.org/1647/ |doi=10.1080/09540090050129763 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
Emotions are an important characteristic of the human species. An emotion is an abstract concept that is most easily observed by looking at facial expressions. Emotions and their relation to categorical perception are often studied using facial expressions.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Ursula |author2=Reginald Adams |author3=Robert Kleck|title=The Categorical Perception of Emotions and Traits|journal=Social Cognition|year=2009|volume=27|issue=2|doi=10.1521/soco.2009.27.2.320|pages=320–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheal|first=Jenna|author2=M.

Emotions are divided into categories because they are discrete from one another. Each emotion entails a separate and distinct set of reactions, consequences, and expressions. The feeling and expression of emotions is a natural occurrence, and, it is actually a universal occurrence for some emotions. There are six basic emotions that are considered universal to the human species across age, gender, race, country, and culture and that are considered to be categorically distinct. These six basic emotions are: happiness, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger, and fear.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt; According to the discrete emotions approach, people experience one emotion and not others, rather than a blend.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt; Categorical perception of emotional facial expressions does not require lexical categories.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt;  Of these six emotions, happiness is the most easily identified.

The perception of emotions using facial expressions reveals slight gender differences&lt;ref name=Hess /&gt; based on the definition and boundaries (essentially, the “edge line” where one emotion ends and a subsequent emotion begins) of the categories. The emotion of anger is perceived easier and quicker when it is displayed by males. However, the same effects are seen in the emotion of happiness when portrayed by women.&lt;ref name=Hess /&gt;  These effects are essentially observed because the categories of the two emotions (anger and happiness) are more closely associated with other features of these specific genders.

Although a verbal label is provided to emotions, it is not required to categorically perceive them. Before language in infants, they can distinguish emotional responses. The categorical perception of emotions is by a "hardwired mechanism".&lt;ref name= Sauter /&gt; Additional evidence exists showing the verbal labels from cultures that may not have a label for a specific emotion but can still categorically perceive it as its own emotion, discrete and isolated from other emotions.&lt;ref name= Sauter /&gt; The perception of emotions into categories has also been studied using the tracking of eye movements which showed an implicit response with no verbal requirement because the eye movement response required only the movement and no subsequent verbal response.&lt;ref name=Cheal /&gt;

The categorical perception of emotions is sometimes a result of joint processing. Other factors may be involved in this perception. Emotional expression and invariable features (features that remain relatively consistent) often work together.&lt;ref name= Otten /&gt; Race is one of the invariable features that contribute to categorical perception in conjunction with expression. Race can also be considered a social category.&lt;ref name=Otten /&gt; Emotional categorical perception can also be seen as a mix of categorical and dimensional perception. Dimensional perception involves visual imagery. Categorical perception occurs even when processing is dimensional.&lt;ref name= Fujimura /&gt;

In [[Sikhism]], '''{{transl|pa|chardi kala}}''' is the Punjabi term for aspiring to maintain a mental state of eternal [[optimism]] and [[joy]]. Sikhs are ideally expected to be in this positive state of mind as a sign of their contentment with the [[will of God]] (''{{transl|pa|bhana}}''), even during the times of adversity.&lt;ref name="Rebecca2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rebecca Sachs Norris | title=Religion and the Body: Modern Science and the Construction of Religious Meaning | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyV1NwzcfJsC&amp;pg=PA240 | access-date=16 February 2013 | date=17 February 2012 | publisher=BRILL | isbn=978-90-04-22111-6 | pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be translated as "positive attitude"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} or "ascending energy".&lt;ref name="Rebecca2012"/&gt; It is also described as being in "high spirits" or “positive, buoyant and optimistic” attitude to life and to the future. Chardi kala is the state of mind in which a person has no negative emotions like [[fear]], [[jealousy]] or [[enmity]]. Instead the mind has many positive feelings including joy, satisfaction and self-dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Harjinder Singh Majhail, 2010. Philosophy of 'Charhdi Kala' and Higher State of Mind in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Deepak Publishers, Jallandhar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhs believe in the will of God (''bhana''). They also believe that the God is without enemies (''nirvair''), and is always merciful. Hence, the humans should accept his will even at times one suffers severe hardship. Thus, chardi kala is the indicator of a Sikh’s absolute faith in the [[Akal Purakh]] (the God). This attitude allows one to face the hardships with as little harm as possible. This also involves joining and helping others in their hour of need.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">'''Compossibility''' is a philosophical concept from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. According to Leibniz, a complete individual thing (for example a person) is characterized by all its properties, and these determine its relations with other individuals. The existence of one individual may contradict the existence of another. A possible world is made up of individuals that are '''compossible'''&amp;mdash;that is, individuals that can exist together. Leibniz indicates that a world is a set of compossible things, however, that a world is a kind of collection of things that God could bring into existence. For not even God can bring into existence a world in which there is some contradiction among its members or their properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/&lt;/ref&gt;

When Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of compossible, finite things that God could have brought into existence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is part of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is simply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because it is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the fact that we are here experiencing this world—the actual world—means that there is at least one possible world. In Leibniz's view, there are an infinite number of possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Gregory |year=1987 |title=Compossibility, Harmony, and Perfection in Leibniz |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=173–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' entry on Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics by Brandon C. Look, views on "compossibility" and the closely related [[best of all possible worlds]] argument are to be found  in ''On the Ultimate Origination of Things'', ''The Discourse in Metaphysics'', ''On Freedom'', and throughout his works. The term itself is found in ''The Philosophical Writings III'' [''Die philosophischen Schriften III''] when Leibniz writes to [[Louis Bourguet]].&lt;ref name="Leibniz's Modal Mechanics"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/ | title = Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics | date = 2008-05-23 | accessdate = 2010-01-22 | publisher = ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' | location = Palo Alto, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]] borrows this concept in defining philosophy as the creation of a "space of compossibility" for heterogeneous [[truth]]s.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses it in ''Cinema II'' taking support from Leibniz's explanation of the [[problem of future contingents]].

A '''concession''' or '''concession agreement''' is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-concession-agreement.htm#did-you-know What is a concession agreement?], wisegeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public services]] such as [[water supply]] may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out [[investment]] in a public utility (such as a [[water privatisation]]) for a given number of years. Other forms of contracts between public and private entities, namely [[lease contract]] and [[management contract]] (in the water sector often called by the French term ''affermage''), are closely related but differ from a concession in the rights of the operator and its remuneration. A lease gives a company the right to operate and maintain a public utility, but investment remains the responsibility of the public. Under a management contract the operator will collect the revenue only on behalf of the government and will in turn be paid an agreed fee.

A grant of land or property by a government may be in return for services or for a particular use, a right to undertake and profit by a specified activity, a lease for a particular purpose. A concession may include the right to use some existing [[infrastructure]] required to carry out a business (such as a water supply system in a city); in some cases, such as [[mining]], it may involve merely the transfer of exclusive or non-exclusive [[easement]]s.

In the private sector, the owner of a concession &amp;mdash; the ''concessionaire'' &amp;mdash; typically pays either a fixed sum or a percentage of revenue to the owner of the entity from which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/concessionagreement.asp Definition of concession agreement] investorpedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of concessions within another business are [[concession stand]]s within sporting venues and movie theaters and concessions in [[department stores]] operated by other [[retailer]]s. Short term concessions may be granted as promotional space for periods as short as one day.

Depending on what the law that is related to a sector states, concession can either allow the authority to retain or keep ownership of the assets, turning over to the concessionaire and reverting the ownership back to an authority once the duration of their concession ended, or both the authority and concessionaire own the facilities.

==Early history==
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=34,36|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other examples of concessions, see ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' and [[History of rail transport in the United States|United States railroad policy]].

==European Union regulation==
Within the [[European Union]], the granting of concessions by public bodies is subject to regulation. Works concessions have been subject to award rules for some time as Directive 2004/18/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council]] on [[Government procurement in the European Union|public procurement]] applied to works concessions, and the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest has been subject to the principles of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. However, the European Parliament and the European Council issued a further Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0023&amp;from=EN Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament of the Council on the award of concession contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 February 2014 which required EU member states to introduce national legislation covering the award of concession contracts in excess of EUR 5,186,000 awarded on or after 18 April 2016.

In the UK, the threshold for concession contracts is £4,104,394.

'''Creepiness''' is the state of being [[wikt:creepy|creepy]], or causing an unpleasant feeling of [[fear]] or [[wikt:unease|unease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/12/26/what-is-creepiness/|title=What is “creepiness”? - Sociological Images| |first=The Society|last=Pages|website=thesocietypages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who exhibits creepy behaviour is called a '''creep'''. Certain traits or hobbies may make people seem creepy to others. The internet has been described as increasingly creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-age-of-creepiness|title=The Age of Creepiness|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Kotsko]] has compared the modern conception of creepiness to the [[Freudian]] concept of ''[[unheimlich]]''. The term has also been used to describe [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] phenomena.

==History and studies==
[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|140px||Clowns are thought by some as creepy]]
The concept of creepiness has only recently been formally addressed in [[social media marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bikramjit Rishi, Subir Bandyopadhyay ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=epcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=creepy%20OR%20creepiness&amp;f=false Contemporary Issues in Social Media Marketing]''
1317193989  2017 "In this chapter, we define creepiness and discuss how privacy and perceived creepiness differ. Then, we explain why creepiness matters and provide recommendations to minimize the negative effect of perceived creepiness on customer ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the abstract the feeling of "creepiness" is subjective: for example some [[dolls]] have been described as creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69472/what-creepiness|title=What is 'Creepiness'?|date=6 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the modern attribute of "creepiness" includes the feeling of social stalking and privacy invasions. For example, the practice of [[Real-time ridesharing|ride share]] service [[Uber (company)|Uber]] monitoring the post-ride activity of its passengers has been described as creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/08/29/uber-is-getting-rid-creepy-tracking-feature-in-its-app.html|title=Uber is getting rid of a creepy tracking feature in its app|first=Chris|last=Ciaccia|date=29 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the company announced that they would be ending this practice.  An example of purported creepy behavior is that by the purity pledgers of the purity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2010/11/10/daddy-abstinence-worldtough-women/|title=Daddy I Do: "Purity" World is Tough for Women - Rewire.News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Genderization==
A 2016 study by Francis McAndrew and Sara Koehnke from [[Knox College (Illinois)]] surveyed 1,342 people of all ages (1,029 females and 312 male) about what kind of traits the subjects found creepy if a friend was describing meeting someone new to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/how-creepy-are-you-scientists-have-published-the-first-definitive-measure-of-creepiness|title=Scientists Have Published The First Definitive Study of Creepiness|first=Fiona|last=MacDonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that men were more likely to be seen as creepy than women. Females are more likely than males to perceive sexual threat from a creepy person. Unpredictability is an important component of creepiness. Also hobbies and occupations related to handling the dead, clowns, and [[bird watching]] were commonly thought as creepy. A post on Jezebel has said that there exists a blurriness and ill-defined difference between healthy forms of male sexual expression and being creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jezebel.com/5658193/why-do-we-demonize-men-who-are-honest-about-their-sexual-needs|title=Why Do We Demonize Men Who Are Honest About Their Sexual Needs?|first=Clarisse |last=Thorn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''creep'' is typically applied to unattractive people, a facet that has resulted in some analysts describing the term as cacophobic.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Job, et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanda_Rood/publication/51747607_Prevalence_demographic_and_clinical_characteristics_of_body_dysmorphic_disorder_among_psychiatric_outpatients_with_mood_anxiety_or_somatoform_disorders/links/0c96053c4d469a57a3000000/Prevalence-demographic-and-clinical-characteristics-of-body-dysmorphic-disorder-among-psychiatric-outpatients-with-mood-anxiety-or-somatoform-disorders.pdf Prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of body dysmorphic disorder among psychiatric outpatients with mood, anxiety or somatoform disorders]."

'''Digital materialization''' (DM) &lt;ref&gt;T. Vilbrandt, A. Pasko, C. Vilbrandt, Fabricating Nature, Technoetic Arts, Vol. 7, Issue 2, {{ISSN|1477-965X}}, Intellect, UK, 2009, pp. 165-174&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;R. Armstrong, [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl.2009.16.1.16101 Systems architecture: a new model for sustainability and the built environment using nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science with living technology], ''Artificial Life'', MIT Press, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2010, pp. 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
can loosely be defined as two-way direct communication or conversion between matter and information that enables people to exactly describe, monitor, manipulate and create any arbitrary real object. DM is a general [[paradigm]] alongside a specified framework that is suitable for computer processing and includes: holistic, coherent, volumetric modeling systems; symbolic languages that are able to handle infinite degrees of freedom and detail in a compact format; and the direct interaction and/or fabrication of any object at any spatial resolution without the need for “lossy” or intermediate formats.

''DM'' systems possess the following attributes:

* realistic - correct spatial mapping of matter to information
* exact - exact language and/or methods for input from and output to matter
* infinite - ability to operate at any scale and define infinite detail
* symbolic - accessible to individuals for design, creation and modification

Such an approach can not only be applied to tangible objects but can include the conversion of things such as light and sound to/from information and matter. Systems to digitally materialize light and sound already largely exist now (e.g. photo editing, audio mixing, etc.) and have been quite effective - but the representation, control and creation of tangible matter is poorly support by computational and digital systems.

Commonplace computer-aided design and manufacturing systems currently represent real objects as "2.5 dimensional" shells. In contrast, DM proposes a deeper understanding and sophisticated manipulation of matter by directly using rigorous mathematics as complete volumetric descriptions of real objects. By utilizing technologies such as [[Function representation]] (FRep) it becomes possible to compactly describe and understand the surface and internal structures or properties of an object at an infinite resolution. Thus models can accurately represent matter across all scales making it possible to capture the complexity and quality of natural and real objects and ideally suited for digital fabrication and other kinds of real world interactions. DM surpasses the previous limitations of static disassociated languages and simple human-made objects, to propose systems that are heterogeneous, interacting directly and more naturally with the complex world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vilbrandt, E. Malone, H. Lipson, A. Pasko, Universal Desktop Fabrication, in ''Heterogeneous Objects Modelling and Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', vol. 4889, Springer Verlag, 2008, pp. 259-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital and computer-based languages and processes, unlike the analogue counterparts, can computationally and spatially describe and control matter in an exact, constructive and accessible manner. However, this requires approaches that can handle the complexity of natural objects and materials.

In [[general relativity]], the  '''gravitoelectric tensor''' or '''[[tidal tensor]]''' is one of the pieces in the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].   It is physically interpreted as giving the tidal stresses on small bits of a material object (which may also be acted upon by other physical forces), or the tidal accelerations of a small cloud of [[test particle]]s in a [[vacuum solution]] or [[electrovacuum solution]].

The concept predates this coinage, with [[Plato]] suggesting applying the principles of [[selective breeding]] to humans around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE.

[[Frederick Osborn]]'s 1937 journal article "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy"&lt;ref name="Osborn1937"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Frederick |author-link=Frederick Osborn |title=Development of a Eugenic Philosophy|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=2|issue=3 |pages=389–397|date=June 1937|doi=10.2307/2084871|jstor=2084871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; framed it as a [[social philosophy]]—that is, a philosophy with implications for [[social order]]. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of [[sexual reproduction]] among people with desired traits (positive eugenics), or reduced rates of sexual reproduction and [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people with less-desired or undesired traits (negative eugenics).

Alternatively, gene selection rather than "people selection" has recently been made possible through advances in [[genome editing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/crispr-cas9-and-targeted-genome-editing-a-new-era-in-molecular-biology |title=CRISPR/Cas9 and Targeted Genome Editing: A New Era in Molecular Biology |date=2014 |access-date=8 July 2015 |work=NEB Expressions |issue=I |first1=Alex |last1=Reis |first2=Breton |last2=Hornblower |first3=Brett |last3=Robb |first4=George |last4=Tzertzinis |publisher=New England Biolabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is sometimes called [[new eugenics]], also known as neo-eugenics, consumer eugenics, or liberal eugenics.

While eugenic principles have been practiced as far back in world history as [[ancient Greece]], the modern [[history of eugenics]] began in the early 20th century when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=25054146 |title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests and Policy Variance Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and U.S |date=1 January 2001 |journal=World Politics |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–263|last1=Hansen |first1=Randall |last2=King |first2=Desmond }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread to many countries including the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oBYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6315,1778929 |title=Sterilization of Unfit Advocated – Feeble-minded Increasing at Disproportionate Rate in Canada – Case for Ungenics |work=The Montreal Gazette |volume=CLXII |issue=272 |date=14 November 1933 |via=News.Google.com |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[Europe]]an countries. In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies with the intent to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both "positive" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly "fit" to reproduce, and "negative" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different [[IQ]] tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when many of the [[defendants]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States|U.S. eugenics]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1=Alison |last1=Bashford |first2=Philippa |last2=Levine |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&amp;q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&amp;f=false |page=327|isbn=9780199706532 |date=2010-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following [[World War II]], with the institution of [[human rights]], many countries gradually began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them the United States and [[Sweden]], continued to carry out forced sterilizations.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, when new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures became available such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), fear has emerged about a possible revival of eugenics.

A major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of [[genetic diversity]], resulting in [[inbreeding depression]] due to lower genetic variation.

===Origin and development===

The concept of positive eugenics to produce better human beings has existed at least since [[Plato]] suggested [[Selective breeding|selective mating]] to produce a guardian class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/ |title=Eugenics |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=2 January 2015 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sparta]], every Spartan child was inspected by the council of elders, the [[Gerousia]], which determined if the child was fit to live or not. In the early years of [[ancient Rome]], a Roman father was [[Twelve Tables|obliged by law]] to immediately kill his child if they were [[Physical disability|physically disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/12tables.html The Laws of the Twelve Tables, c.450 B.C.] "A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed"
&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, people who were cowardly, unwarlike or "stained with abominable [[vices]]" were put to death, usually by being drowned in swamps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]. [[wikisource:Germania (Church &amp; Brodribb)#XII|Germania.XII]] "Traitors and deserters are hanged on trees; the coward, the unwarlike, the man stained with abominable vices, is plunged into the mire of the morass, with a hurdle put over him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Karin |date=2009 |title=Bodies in the Bog and the Archaeological Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FU4H-JKPbhkC&amp;pg=PA62 |location= |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=62 |isbn=0226734048 |author-link= |quote=Tacitus's Germania, read through this kind of filter, became a manual for racial and sexual eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first formal negative eugenics, that is a legal provision against the birth of allegedly inferior human beings, was promulgated in Western European culture by the Christian [[Council of Agde]] in 506, which forbade marriage between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Frances (2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5pXmkCf3LEIC&amp;pg=PR2-IA10&amp;dq=Eugenics+506+Agde&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX2pys46rYAhUhJsAKHXXKAeMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eugenics%20506%20Agde&amp;f=false''Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages''] New York: Harper Collins. p.ii {{isbn|9780062016737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a modern project of improving the human population through a statistical understanding of [[heredity]] used to encourage good breeding was originally developed by [[Francis Galton]] and, initially, was closely linked to Darwinism and his theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 309"&gt;Bowler, Peter J., ''Evolution: The History of an Idea,'' 3rd Ed., University of California Press, 2003, pp. 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Galton had read his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which sought to explain the development of plant and animal species, and desired to apply it to humans. Based on his biographical studies, Galton believed that desirable human qualities were hereditary traits, though Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Eugenics |first=Randall |last=Hansen |title=Eugenics: Immigration and Asylum from 1990 to Present |editor-first1=Matthew J. |editor-last1=Gibney |editor-first2=Randall |editor-last2=Hansen |date=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/abcmigrate/eugenics |access-date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, one year after Darwin's death, Galton gave his research a name: ''eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: The Secret of Life |first1=Watson |last1=James D. |last2=Berry |first2=Andrew |date=2009 |publisher=Knopf |url= https://www.amazon.com/DNA-The-Secret-Life-ebook/dp/B001PSEQAG}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[genetics]], eugenics became associated with [[genetic determinism]], the belief that human character is entirely or in the majority caused by genes, unaffected by education or living conditions. Many of the early geneticists were not Darwinians, and evolution theory was not needed for eugenics policies based on genetic determinism.&lt;ref name="Bowler 309" /&gt; Throughout its recent history, eugenics has remained controversial.{{sfn|Blom|2008|p = 336}}

In addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=240}} Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=286}} the Cold Spring Harbour Carnegie Institution for [[Experimental Evolution]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=40}} and the [[Eugenics Record Office]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=45}} Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 6: The United States of Sterilization}} In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=237}} Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure "[[Nordic race]]" or "[[Aryan]]" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of "unfit" races.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 5: Legitimizing Raceology}}{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 9: Mongrelization}}

Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Ferrante |title=Sociology: A Global Perspective |url= https://books.google.com/?id=AwnIIXI6y38C&amp;pg=PA259 |date=1 January 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-8400-3204-1 |pages=259 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], the German-American anthropologist [[Franz Boas]], who argued that advocates of eugenics greatly over-estimate the influence of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turda |first=Marius |chapter=Race, Science and Eugenics in the Twentieth Century |editor1-last=Bashford |editor1-first=Alison |editor2-last=Levine |editor2-first=Philippa |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |isbn=0-19-988829-9 |pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author [[Halliday Sutherland]]. Ward's 1913 article "[https://archive.org/details/jstor-2763324 Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics]", Chesterton's 1917 book ''[[s:Eugenics and other Evils|Eugenics and Other Evils]]'', and Boas' 1916 article "[[s:Eugenics|Eugenics]]" (published in ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'') were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address "Consumption: Its Cause and Cure",&lt;ref&gt;"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticism of eugenists and Neo-[[Malthusianism|Malthusian]]s in his 1921 book ''Birth Control'' led to a writ for libel from the eugenist [[Marie Stopes]]. Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including [[Lancelot Hogben]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lancelot Hogben, who developed his critique of eugenics and distaste for racism in the period...he spent as Professor of Zoology at the University of Cape Town".  Alison Bashford and Philippa Levine, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics''. Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|0199706530}} (p.200)&lt;/ref&gt; Other biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher|R. A. Fisher]] expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of "defectives" would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.&lt;ref&gt;"Whatever their disagreement on the numbers, Haldane, Fisher, and most geneticists could support Jennings's warning: To encourage the expectation that the sterilization of defectives will "solve the problem of hereditary defects, close up the asylums for feebleminded and insane, do away with prisons, is only to subject society to deception".

As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridley |first=Matt |author-link=Matt Ridley |title=Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters |date=1999 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-089408-5 |pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, [[birth control]], promoting differential birth rates, [[Marriage law#Marriage restrictions|marriage restrictions]], segregation (both [[racial segregation]] and sequestering the mentally ill), [[compulsory sterilization]], [[forced abortion]]s or [[forced pregnancies]], ultimately culminating in [[genocide]].

===Nazism and the decline of eugenics===

{{Main article|Nazi eugenics}}

The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when [[Ernst Rüdin]] used eugenics as a justification for the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies of Nazi Germany]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power.{{sfn|Black|2003|pp=274–295}} Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, [[promiscuous women]], homosexuals, and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] (such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jews in Nazi Germany]]) as "degenerate" or "unfit", and therefore led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, [[euthanasia]], and even [[mass murder]].{{sfn|Black|2003}} The Nazi practice of euthanasia was carried out on hospital patients in the [[Aktion T4]] centers such as [[Hartheim Castle]].

By the end of [[World War II]], many discriminatory eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Black|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 18 "By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely accepted throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the [[Soviet Union]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]], who had called for "the sterilization of failures" in 1904,&lt;ref name="jt"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacky |last=Turner |title=Animal Breeding, Welfare and Society |publisher=Routledge |date=2010 |isbn=1844075893 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in his 1940 book ''The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for?'' that among the [[human rights]], which he believed should be available to all people, was "a prohibition on [[mutilation]], sterilization, [[torture]], and any bodily punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Clapham |title=Human Rights: A Very Short Introduction' |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2007 |isbn=9780199205523 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the practice of "imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|the intent to destroy, in whole or in part]], a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such as:
* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
See the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] also proclaims "the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union |title=Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union |at=Article 3, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the decline in discriminatory eugenics laws, some government mandated sterilizations continued into the 21st century. During the ten years President [[Alberto Fujimori]] led Peru from 1990 to 2000, 2,000 persons were allegedly involuntarily sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/25/world/americas/peru-sterilization/ |title= Peru will not prosecute former President over sterilization campaign |first1=Pierre |last1= Meilhan |first2=Ben |last2= Brumfield |lastauthoramp=yes|date=January 25, 2014 |website= CNN.com |publisher= [[CNN]] |access-date= 19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] maintained its [[one-child policy]] until 2015 as well as a suite of other eugenics based legislation to reduce population size and manage fertility rates of different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dikötter |first=F. |date=1998 |title=Imperfect Conceptions: Medical Knowledge, Birth Defects, and Eugenics in China |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Edge |first=Geoffrey |last=Miller |title=2013: What {{em|Should}} We Be Worried About?

===Modern resurgence of interest===
Developments in [[Genetic engineering|genetic]], [[Genetic testing|genomic]], and [[Human cloning|reproductive technologies]] at the end of the 20th century have raised numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, effectively creating a [[History of eugenics#Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation|resurgence of interest]] in the subject.
Some, such as [[UC Berkeley]] sociologist [[Troy Duster]], claim that modern genetics is a back door to eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Charles J. |title=Is modern genetics the new eugenics? |journal=Genetics in Medicine |date=1 November 2003 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=469–475 |doi=10.1097/01.GIM.0000093978.77435.17 |url= http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v5/n6/full/gim2003376a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, [[Tania Simoncelli]], who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at [[Hampshire College]] that advances in [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) are moving society to a "new era of eugenics", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, "where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tania |last=Simoncelli |author-link=Tania Simoncelli |title=Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis and Selection: From disease prevention to customised conception |journal=Different Takes |volume=24 |date=2003 |url=http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=18 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018034037/http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 newspaper article, [[Richard Dawkins]] said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From the Afterward |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |author-link=Richard Dawkins |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=2006 |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 |access-date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the [[Founding Father]] of [[Singapore]], started promoting eugenics as early as 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blynkt.com/issue-1/eugenics-in-postcolonial-singapore |title=Eugenics in Postcolonial Singapore |first=Ying-kit |last=Chan |date=4 October 2016 |website=Blynkt.com |location=Berlin |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mustsharenews.com/lee-kuan-yew-controversies/ |title=13 Controversies of Lee Kuan Yew |date=10 March 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no specific by-line.--&gt; |website=MustShareNews.com |location=Singapore |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the United Nations' [[International Bioethics Committee]] wrote that the ethical problems of [[human genetic engineering]] should not be confused with the ethical problems of the [[History of eugenics|20th century eugenics movements]]. However, it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want, or cannot afford, the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Bioethics Committee |title=Report of the IBC on Updating Its Reflection on the Human Genome and Human Rights |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233258E.pdf |date=2 October 2015 |access-date=22 October 2015 |page=27 |quote=The goal of enhancing individuals and the human species by engineering the genes related to some characteristics and traits is not to be confused with the barbarous projects of eugenics that planned the simple elimination of human beings considered as ‘imperfect’ on an ideological basis. However, it impinges upon the principle of respect for human dignity in several ways. It weakens the idea that the differences among human beings, regardless of the measure of their endowment, are exactly what the recognition of their equality presupposes and therefore protects. It introduces the risk of new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who cannot afford such enhancement or simply do not want to resort to it. The arguments that have been produced in favour of the so-called liberal eugenics do not trump the indication to apply the limit of medical reasons also in this case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanism]] is often associated with eugenics, although most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silver |first=Lee M. |author-link=Lee M.

[[Prenatal diagnosis|Prenatal screening]] can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics because it may lead to abortions of children with undesirable traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Gareth M. |last2=Rothman |first2=Barbara Katz |date=April 2016 |title=Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening |url= http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2016/04/stas1-1604.html|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |publisher=American Medical Association |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=406–415 |doi= 10.1001/journalofethics.2016.18.4.stas1-1604|access-date=2 September 2016 |quote=We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term eugenics and its modern field of study were first formulated by [[Francis Galton]] in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galton |first=Francis |author-link=Francis Galton |title=Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |date=1883 |location=London |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on the recent work of his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm |title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin |publisher=Galton.org |access-date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |work=Darwin Correspondence Project |title=The Correspondence of Charles Darwin |volume=Volume 17: 1869 |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=28 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124215918/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton published his observations and conclusions in his book ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''.

The origins of the concept began with certain interpretations of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the theories of [[August Weismann]].{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=335–336}} The word ''eugenics'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''eu'' ("good" or "well") and the suffix ''-genēs'' ("born"), and was coined by Galton in 1883 to replace the word "[[Oneida stirpiculture|stirpiculture]]", which he had used previously but which had come to be mocked due to its perceived sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lester Frank |last1=Ward |first2=Emily |last2=Palmer Cape |first3=Sarah Emma |last3=Simons |title=Glimpses of the Cosmos |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KDEZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1918 |publisher=G. P. Putnam's sons |pages=382 ''ff.'' |chapter=Eugenics, Euthenics and Eudemics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton defined eugenics as "the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvnb|Black|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term eugenics has referred to everything from [[prenatal care]] for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spektorowski |first1=Alberto |last2=Ireni-Saban |first2=Liza |title=Politics of Eugenics: Productionism, Population, and National Welfare |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-74023-1 |page=24 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zdkdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Historically,+the+term+has+referred+to+everything+from+prenatal+care+for+mothers+to+forced+sterilization+and+euthanasia#v=onepage&amp;q=Historically%2C%20the%20term%20has%20referred%20to%20everything%20from%20prenatal%20care%20for%20mothers%20to%20forced%20sterilization%20and%20euthanasia&amp;f=false |access-date=16 January 2017 |quote=As an applied science, thus, the practice of eugenics referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.  Galton divided the practice of eugenics into two types—positive and negative—both aimed at improving the human race through selective breeding.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Population genetics|population geneticists]], the term has included the avoidance of [[inbreeding]] without altering [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]]; for example, [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote that "the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J. |title=Lysenko and Genetics |journal=Science and Society |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=1940 |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/haldane/works/1940s/lysenko.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics continues today.&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of the shifting meanings of the term can be found in {{cite book |last=Paul |first=Diane |title=Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present |publisher=Humanities Press |location=New Jersey |date=1995 |isbn=1-57392-343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Black]], journalist and author of ''War Against the Weak'', claims eugenics is often deemed a [[pseudoscience]] because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is often deemed a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=978-1-56858-321-1 |page=370 |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. Historically, this aspect of eugenics was tainted with [[scientific racism]] and pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=978-1-56858-321-1 |page=370 |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak |date=2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Worrall |first=Simon |title=The Gene: Science's Most Dangerous Idea |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/gene-history-siddhartha-mukherjee-science-eugenics/|work=National Geographic|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=White |first=Susan |title=LibGuides: The Sociology of Science and Technology: Pseudoscience |url= http://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=84711&amp;p=4441670 |publisher=Library of University of Princeton |access-date=12 September 2017 |date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early eugenists were mostly concerned with factors of perceived [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] that often correlated strongly with social class. Some of these early eugenists include [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Weldon]], who worked on this at the [[University College London]].&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"/&gt;

Eugenics also had a place in medicine. In his lecture "Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics", Karl Pearson said that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. He basically placed the two words as equivalents. He was supported in part by the fact that Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, also had medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salgirli |first=S. G. |title=Eugenics for the doctors: Medicine and social control in 1930s Turkey |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=281–312 |date=July 2011 |pmid=20562206 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrq040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"/&gt; Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, ''in vitro'' fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning.&lt;ref name="glad2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Glad |author-link=John Glad |title=Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=Hermitage Publishers |date=2008 |isbn=1-55779-154-6 |url= http://www.whatwemaybe.org/txt/txt0000/Glad.John.2008.FHE.Meisenberg-abridgement.en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie [[Gattaca]] provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning.&lt;ref name = "glad2008"/&gt; Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pine |first=Lisa |title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=nW2aE5-rAMsC&amp;pg=PA19 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1997 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-85973-907-5 |pages=19 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] claims that eugenics simply means "good genes" and using it as synonym for genocide is an "all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States." According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the [[Progressive Era]] and not "Hitler's twisted [[Final Solution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462.html |title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the 'New Eugenics' |first=John |last=Entine |date=30 December 2014 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation methods===
According to [[Richard Lynn]], eugenics may be divided into two main categories based on the ways in which the methods of eugenics can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''Part III. The Implementation of Classical Eugenics'' pp. 137–244 ''Part IV. The New Eugenics'' pp. 245–320&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classical eugenics
** Negative eugenics by provision of information and services, i.e. reduction of unplanned pregnancies and births.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 165–186&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Abstinence-only sex education|Advocacy for sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Sex education| Sex education in schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt;
*** School-based clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 172–174&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Promoting the use of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Emergency contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt;

*** Abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;
** Negative eugenics by incentives, coercion and compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 187–204&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Project Prevention|Incentives for sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

*** Incentives for women on welfare to use contraceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Payments for sterilization in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Curtailment of benefits to welfare mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Compulsory sterilization]] of the "mentally retarded".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 196–199. Quote: "There is, nevertheless, a good case for reviving the sterilization of the mentally retarded and criminals. It is indisputable on both empirical and theorethical ground that many of these people transmit their characteristics to their children by both genetic and environmental processes."&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of female criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 199–201. First quote: "The rationale for this sentencing policy was that the judges considered these women unfit to rear children and that they should therefore be prevented from having more, at least for a few years." Second quote: "In these and similar cases many people will no doubt accept that the judges were right in deciding that the women were unfit mothers and likely to cause harm to any future children and that it would be desirable to prevent further pregnancies. It is preferable for these women to be put on probation conditional on temporary sterilization than to send them to prison, which in most cases would serve little useful purpose. These judges' decisions were not made ostensibly on eugenic grounds, but they furthered the eugenic objective of preventing these women from having children, at least for a limited period. The eugenic objective should be to support these judicial sentences and to promote their use more often, together with the stipulation of longer periods of contraception and, preferably, permanent sterilization"&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of male criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 201–203. Quote: "A better alternative, from the point of view of reducing future criminal offending and the promotion of eugenics, would be for judges to offer convicted male criminals the alternatives of imprisonment or castration accompanied by probation."&lt;/ref&gt;
** Licences for parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 205–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/14/time-to-restrict-human-breeding |title=It's time to consider restricting human breeding |first=Zoltan |last=Istvan |date=14 August 2014 |website=Wired.com |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 211–213. Richard Lynn argued that to have an effective licensing program, reversible sterilization methods should be used. Those who wish to have children would obtain the licence and have the sterilization reversed. Lynn stated that the proposals made by Francis Galton, Hugh LaFollette and John Westman would not be effective from the eugenicists' viewpoint, since those without licences could still have children. The proposal by David Lykken would be only slightly effective.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–224&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Baby bonus|Financial incentives to have children]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Selective incentives for childbearing.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 217–219&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Taxation of the childless.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Ethical obligations of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 220–221. Quote: "While it can be confidently expected that elites would respond to financial incentives to have children and to penalties for childlessness by increasing their fertility, they might not do this to the extent that would be desired. Ideally a program of positive eugenics would increase the fertility of the elite to perhaps around four children per couple; and at the same time a complementary program of negative eugenics would reduce the fertility of those with low intelligence and psychopathic personality to zero.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Immigration|Eugenic immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 222–224. Quote: "The final strategy for the promotion of positive eugenics would consist of the acceptance of good-quality immigrants."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
===Efficacy===
The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. He demonstrated the event of [[Mutation|genetic mutation]] occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly (''Drosophila melanogaster'')]] with white eyes from a family with red eyes.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was not completely scientifically accurate.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed that the definitions of these traits varied and that accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay5text.html|title=Social Origins of Eugenics|website=Eugenicsarchive.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Morgan's public rejection of eugenics, much of his genetic research was absorbed by eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Origins of Eugenics |first=Elof Axel |last=Carlson |url= http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay2text.html |access-date=3 October 2013 |work=Image Archive on the American Eugenics Movement |publisher=Dolan DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |first=Thomas C. (Tim) |last=Leonard |format=pdf |work=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=19 |issue=4 |date=Fall 2005 |pages=207–224 |url= https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |access-date=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] [[Carrier testing|test]] is used for the early detection of [[Recessive trait|recessive]] hereditary diseases, allowing for couples to determine if they are at risk of passing genetic defects to a future child.&lt;ref name = "drze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drze.de/in-focus/predictive-genetic-testing/modules/heterozygote-test-screening-programmes|title=Heterozygote test / Screening programmes — DRZE|website=Drze.de|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the test is to estimate the likelihood of passing the hereditary disease to future descendants.&lt;ref name = "drze"/&gt;

Recessive traits can be severely reduced, but never eliminated unless the complete genetic makeup of all members of the pool was known, as aforementioned. As only very few undesirable traits, such as Huntington's disease, are dominant, it could be argued{{by whom|date=November 2014}} from certain perspectives that the practicality of "eliminating" traits is quite low.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are examples of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of recessive diseases, although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish population ([[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay–Sachs]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan's disease]], and [[Gaucher's disease]]), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |title=Fatal Gift: Jewish Intelligence and Western Civilization |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090813162344/http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |archive-date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pleiotropy]] occurs when one [[gene]] influences multiple, seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s, an example being [[phenylketonuria]], which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect.&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearns |first=F. W. |date=2010 |title=One Hundred Years of Pleiotropy: A Retrospective |url= http://www.genetics.org/content/186/3/767.abstract |journal=Genetics |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=767–773 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.122549 |pmid=21062962 |pmc=2975297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzej Pękalski, from the [[University of Wrocław]], argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with [[myopia]] from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.&lt;ref name ="pekalski"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=A. |date=2000 |title=Effect of eugenics on the evolution of populations |url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100510070148 |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=329–332 |doi=10.1007/s100510070148 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..329P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of genetic diversity===
Eugenic policies could also lead to loss of [[genetic diversity]], in which case a culturally accepted "improvement" of the gene pool could very likely—as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations —result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change, and other factors both known and unknown. A long-term, species-wide eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.&lt;ref&gt;(Galton 2001, 48){{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward M. Miller]] claims that, in any one generation, any realistic program should make only minor changes in a fraction of the gene pool, giving plenty of time to reverse direction if [[unintended consequences]] emerge, reducing the likelihood of the elimination of desirable genes.&lt;ref name = "miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Edward M. |title=Eugenics: Economics for the Long Run |journal=Research in Biopolitics |volume=5 |pages=391–416 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that any appreciable reduction in diversity is so far in the future that little concern is needed for now.&lt;ref name = "miller"/&gt;

While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some diseases such as [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]] respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to [[cholera]] when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. Reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease genes in Africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.

However, some [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] cause people to consider some elements of eugenics.

===Ethics===
Societal and political consequences of eugenics call for a place in the discussion on the ethics behind the eugenics movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bentwich |first=M. |date=2013 |title=On the inseparability of gender eugenics, ethics, and public policy: An Israeli perspective |journal=American Journal of Bioethics |volume=13 |issue=10|pages=43–45 |doi=10.1080/15265161.2013.828128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical concerns regarding eugenics arise from its controversial past, prompting a discussion on what place, if any, it should have in the future. Advances in science have changed eugenics. In the past, eugenics had more to do with sterilization and enforced reproduction laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=B. A. |date=2012 |title=Maltreatment of people with serious mental illness in the early 20th century: A focus on Nazi Germany and eugenics in America |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=200 |issue=12 |pages=1096–1100 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318275d391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, in the age of a progressively mapped genome, embryos can be tested for susceptibility to disease, gender, and genetic defects, and alternative methods of reproduction such as in vitro fertilization are becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoge |first1=S. K. |last2=Appelbaum |first2=P. S. |date=2012 |title=Ethics and neuropsychiatric genetics: A review of major issues |journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1547–1557 |doi=10.1017/S1461145711001982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, eugenics is no longer ''ex post facto'' regulation of the living but instead preemptive action on the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Witzany |first=G. |journal=EMBO Reports |title=No time to waste on the road to a liberal eugenics? |volume=17 |issue=3  |page=281 |date=2016 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/embr.201541855/abstract | doi=10.15252/embr.201541855 | pmid=26882552 | pmc=4772985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this change, however, there are ethical concerns which lack adequate attention, and which must be addressed before eugenic policies can be properly implemented in the future. Sterilized individuals, for example, could volunteer for the procedure, albeit under incentive or duress, or at least voice their opinion. The unborn fetus on which these new eugenic procedures are performed cannot speak out, as the fetus lacks the voice to consent or to express his or her opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baird |first=S. L. |date=2007 |title=Designer babies: Eugenics repackaged or consumer options? |url= |journal=Technology Teacher |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers disagree about the proper framework for reasoning about such actions, which change the very identity and existence of future persons.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=M. A. |title=The Nonidentity Problem |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====

[[Image:Eugenics Quarterly to Social Biology.jpg|thumb|In the decades after [[World War II]], the term "eugenics" had taken on a negative connotation and became increasingly unpopular within academic science. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy, as when ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969.]]

A common criticism of eugenics is that "it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''The Ethical Principles of Classical Eugenics – Conclusions'' P. 241 Quote: "A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical. This argument is unpersuasive because all sorts of measures that are acceptable might, if taken to extremes, lead to other measures that are unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the [[euthanasia|killing of the institutionalized]] and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Edwin |author-link=Edwin Black |title=War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|date=2003 |isbn=1-56858-258-7||ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"&gt;{{cite web |last=Darnovsky |first=Marcy |title=Health and human rights leaders call for an international ban on species-altering procedures |date=2001 |url= http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2809 |access-date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George Annas |last=Annas |first=George |author2-link=Lori Andrews |last2=Andrews |first2=Lori |author3-link=Rosario Isasi |last3=Isasi |first3=Rosario |title=Protecting the endangered human: Toward an international treaty prohibiting cloning and inheritable alterations |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=28 |page=151 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against [[germinal choice technology]] and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKibben |first=Bill |author-link=Bill McKibben |title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age |publisher=Times Books |date=2003 |isbn=0-8050-7096-6 |oclc=237794777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, for example [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]], claim that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making from the state to the patient and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Eugenics Impulse|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |first=Nathaniel |last=Comfort |date=12 November 2012 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/|access-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort suggests that "the eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society; and the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic bio-medicine are too great for us to do otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Comfort |first=Nathaniel |title=The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-16991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Bioethics|bioethicist]] Stephen Wilkinson of [[Keele University]] and Honorary Research Fellow Eve Garrard at the [[University of Manchester]], claim that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral. In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that "[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that PGD, and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they're wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction |first1=Stephen |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Eve |last2=Garrard |publisher=Keele University |orig-year=2013 |url= http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf |access-date=18 September 2013 |isbn=978-0-9576160-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book published in 2000, ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen |last2=Brock |first2=Dan W. |last3=Daniels |first3=Norman |last4=Wikler |first4=Daniel |title=From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-66977-4 |oclc=41211380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Original position]], a hypothetical situation developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]], has been used as an argument for ''negative eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, p. 147. Quote: "What Rawls says is that "Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects." The key words here are "preserve" and "prevent". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventative measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to "make the later generations as genetically talented as possible," as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&amp;context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489–491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical "original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a "veil of ignorance" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, "rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice. Such actions are necessary in terms of what the present generation owes to later generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Flow around a wing. This incompressible flow satisfies the Euler equations.]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Euler equations''' are a set of [[Differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]s governing [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] and [[inviscid flow]]. They are named after [[Leonhard Euler]]. The equations represent [[Cauchy momentum equation|Cauchy equations]] of conservation of mass (continuity), and balance of momentum and energy, and can be seen as particular [[Navier–Stokes equations]] with zero [[viscosity]] and zero [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref name="Toro24"&gt;see Toro, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Euler equations can be obtained by linearization of some more precise [[continuity equation]]s like [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in a local equilibrium state given by a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]. The Euler equations can be applied to [[incompressible flow|incompressible]] and to [[compressible flow]] – assuming the [[flow velocity]] is a [[solenoidal field]], or using another appropriate energy equation respectively (the simplest form for Euler equations being the conservation of the [[specific entropy]]). Historically, only the incompressible equations have been derived by Euler. However, fluid dynamics literature often refers to the full set – including the energy equation – of the more general compressible equations together as "the Euler equations".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. (1995), Computational Fluid Dynamics, The Basics With Applications. {{ISBN|0-07-113210-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mathematical point of view, Euler equations are notably hyperbolic [[conservation equation]]s in the case without external field (i.e., in the limit of high [[Froude number]]). In fact, like any Cauchy equation, the Euler equations originally formulated in convective form (also called "[[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian form]]") can also be put in the "conservation form" (also called "[[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Eulerian form]]"). The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical interpretation of the equations as conservation equations through a control volume fixed in space, and is the most important for these equations also from a numerical point of view. The convective form emphasizes changes to the state in a frame of reference moving with the fluid.

==History==
The Euler equations first appeared in published form in Euler's article "Principes généraux du mouvement des fluides", published in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de Berlin'' in 1757 (in this article Euler actually published only the ''general'' form of the continuity equation and the momentum equation;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E226.html E226 – Principes generaux du mouvement des fluides]&lt;/ref&gt; the energy balance equation would be obtained a century later). They were among the first [[partial differential equations]] to be written down. At the time Euler published his work, the system of equations consisted of the momentum and continuity equations, and thus was underdetermined except in the case of an incompressible fluid. An additional equation, which was later to be called the [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic condition]], was supplied by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1816.

During the second half of the 19th century, it was found that the equation related to the balance of energy must at all times be kept, while the adiabatic condition is a consequence of the fundamental laws in the case of smooth solutions. With the discovery of the [[special theory of relativity]], the concepts of energy density, momentum density, and stress were unified into the concept of the [[stress–energy tensor]], and energy and momentum were likewise unified into a single concept, the [[Four-momentum|energy–momentum vector]].&lt;ref name=Christodoulou&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01181-0|last=Christodoulou|first=Demetrios|title=The Euler Equations of Compressible Fluid Flow|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=44|issue=4|date=October 2007|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2007-44-04/S0273-0979-07-01181-0/S0273-0979-07-01181-0.pdf|accessdate=June 13, 2009|pages= 581–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density==
In convective form (i.e., the form with the [[convective derivative|convective operator]] made explicit in the [[Cauchy momentum equation|momentum equation]]), the incompressible Euler equations in case of density constant in time and uniform in space are:&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/notes/euler.pdf Hunter, J.K. An Introduction to the Incompressible Euler Equations]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density''' (''convective or Lagrangian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{D\mathbf{u} \over Dt} = - \nabla w +\mathbf{g} \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|border colour = #0073CF

}}

where:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in an ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;u_1, u_2, \dots, u_N&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;{D \over Dt}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[material derivative]] in time,
*&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[scalar product]],
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here used to represent the specific thermodynamic work [[gradient]] (first equation), and
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity [[divergence]] (second equation),
*&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal [[Linear differential equation|source term]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[inertial acceleration]]s, [[electric field]] acceleration, and so on.

The first equation is the [[Cauchy momentum equation|Euler momentum equation]] with uniform density (for this equation it could also not be constant in time). By expanding the [[material derivative]], the equations become:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial \mathbf{u} \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u =- \nabla w + \mathbf{g}  \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact for a flow with uniform density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; the following identity holds:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla w \equiv \nabla \left(\frac p {\rho_0} \right) = \frac 1 {\rho_0} \nabla p &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the mechanic [[pressure]]. The second equation is the [[incompressible flow|incompressible constraint]], stating the flow velocity is a [[solenoidal field]] (the order of the equations is not casual, but underlines the fact that the incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the [[continuity equation]], but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the [[continuity equation]] would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time ''or'' varying in space. For example, with density uniform but varying in time, the continuity equation to be added to the above set would correspond to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

So the case of constant '''and''' uniform density is the only one not requiring the continuity equation as additional equation regardless of the presence or absence of the incompressible constraint. In fact, the case of incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density being analyzed is a [[toy model]] featuring only two simplified equations, so it is ideal for didactical purposes even if with limited physical relevancy.

The equations above thus represent respectively [[conservation of mass]] (1 scalar equation) and [[conservation of momentum|momentum]] (1 vector equation containing &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; scalar components, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the physical dimension of the space of interest). Flow velocity and pressure are the so-called ''physical variables''.&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;

In a coordinate system given by &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\dots, x_N)&lt;/math&gt; the velocity and external force vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; have components &lt;math&gt;(u_1,\dots, u_N)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_1,\dots, g_N)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then the equations may be expressed in subscript notation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial u_i \over\partial t} + \sum_{j=1}^N {\partial (u_i u_j + w \delta_{ij})\over\partial x_j} = g_i\\
\sum_{i=1}^N {\partial u_i\over\partial x_i}=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; subscripts label the ''N''-dimensional space components, and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kroenecker delta]]. The use of [[Einstein notation]] (where the sum is implied by repeated indices instead of [[Summation#Capital-sigma_notation|sigma notation]]) is also frequent.

===Properties===
Although Euler first presented these equations in 1755, many fundamental questions about them remain unanswered.

In three space dimensions it is not even known whether solutions of the equations are defined for all time or if they form singularities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/notes/euler.pdf Hunter, An introduction to incompressible Euler equations], p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Smooth solutions of the free (in the sense of without source term: g=0) equations satisfy the conservation of specific kinetic energy:

: &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over\partial t} \left(\frac 1 2 u^2 \right) + \nabla \cdot (u^2 \mathbf u + w \mathbf I) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In the one dimensional case without the source term (both pressure gradient and external force), the momentum equation becomes the inviscid [[Burgers equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over\partial t}+ u {\partial u \over\partial x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is a model equation giving many insights on Euler equations.

===Nondimensionalisation===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Nondimensionalisation}}
In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt;, and a characteristic velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;, need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u^* &amp; \equiv \frac u {u_0}, \\[5pt]
r^* &amp; \equiv \frac r {r_0}, \\[5pt]
t^* &amp; \equiv \frac {u_0}{r_0} t, \\[5pt]
p^* &amp; \equiv \frac w {u_0^2}, \\[5pt]
\nabla^* &amp; \equiv r_0 \nabla
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and of the field [[unit vector]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf g}\equiv \frac {\mathbf g} g, &lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of these inversed relations in Euler equations, defining the [[Froude number]], yields (omitting the * at apix):
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density''' (''nondimensional form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D \mathbf u \over Dt}= - \nabla w + \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \hat{\mathbf g}\\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler equations in the Froude limit (no external field) are named free equations and are conservative. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable and can be studied with [[perturbation theory]].

===Conservation form===
{{see also|Conservation equation|}}
The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical properties of Euler equations, and especially the contracted form is often the most convenient one for [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulations. Computationally, there are some advantages in using the conserved variables. This gives rise to a large class of numerical methods
called conservative methods.&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;

The '''free Euler equations are conservative''', in the sense they are equivalent to a conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F ={\mathbf 0},
&lt;/math&gt;

or simply in Einstein notation:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial y_j}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial f_{ij}}{\partial r_i}= 0_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the conservation quantity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; in this case is a vector, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[flux]] matrix. This can be simply proved.

{{hidden
|Demonstration of the conservation form
|First, the following identities hold:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (w \mathbf I) = \mathbf I \cdot \nabla w + w \nabla \cdot \mathbf I = \nabla w &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]]. The same identities expressed in [[Einstein notation]] are:

::&lt;math&gt;\partial_i (w \delta_{ij} ) = \delta_{ij} \partial_i w + w \partial_i \delta_{ij} = \delta_{ij} \partial_i w =  \partial_j w&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;u_j \partial_i u_i = \partial_i (u_i u_j)&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the [[identity matrix]] with dimension N and δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; its general element, the Kroenecker delta.

Thanks to these vector identities, the incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density and without external field can be put in the so-called ''conservation'' (or Eulerian) differential form, with vector notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u  \otimes \mathbf u + w \mathbf I)=\mathbf{0}\\
{\partial 0 \over\partial t}+ \nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0,
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

or with Einstein notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
\partial_t u_j  + \partial_i (u_i u_j + w \delta_{ij})=0\\
\partial_t 0  + \partial _j u_j=0,
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Then '''incompressible''' Euler equations with uniform density have conservation variables:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + w \mathbf I \\ \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the second component u is by itself a vector, with length N, so y has length N+1 and F has size N(N+1). In 3D for example y has length 4, I has size 3x3 and F has size 4x3, so the explicit forms are:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}  u_1 \\ u_2  \\ u_3 \\0 \end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}
u_1^2 + w &amp;  u_1u_2 &amp;  u_1u_3
\\  u_2 u_1 &amp; u_2^2 + w &amp;  u_2 u_3
\\ u_3 u_1 &amp;  u_3 u_2 &amp;  u_3^2 + w 
\\ u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

At last Euler equations can be recast into the particular equation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equation(s) with constant and uniform density''' (''conservation or Eulerian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf u \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + w \mathbf I \\ \mathbf u \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf g \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Spatial dimensions===
For certain problems, especially when used to analyze compressible flow in a duct or in case the flow is cylindrically or spherically symmetric, the one-dimensional Euler equations are a useful first approximation. Generally, the Euler equations are solved by [[Riemann]]'s [[method of characteristics]]. This involves finding curves in plane of independent variables (i.e., &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) along which [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE's) degenerate into [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODE's). [[Numerical analysis|Numerical solutions]] of the Euler equations rely heavily on the method of characteristics.

==Incompressible Euler equations==
In convective form the incompressible Euler equations in case of density variable in space are:&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equations''' (''convective or Lagrangian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{D \rho \over D t} = 0\\
{D \mathbf u \over Dt}=- \frac {\nabla p}{\rho}+\mathbf{g}\\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

where the additional variables are:
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid [[mass density]],
*&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]], &lt;math&gt;p = \rho w&lt;/math&gt;.

The first equation, which is the new one, is the incompressible [[continuity equation]]. In fact the general continuity equation would be:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho \over\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho +  \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

but here the last term is identically zero for the incompressibility constraint.

===Conservation form===
{{see also|conservation equation|}}
The incompressible Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \rho \mathbf u  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho \mathbf u\\\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + p \mathbf I\\\mathbf u\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length &lt;math&gt;N+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size &lt;math&gt;(N+2)\times N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In 3D for example &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length 5, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I&lt;/math&gt; has size 3x3 and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size 5x3, so the explicit forms are:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho \\  \rho u_1 \\ \rho u_2  \\ \rho u_3  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho u_1 &amp; \rho u_2 &amp; \rho u_3 \\
\rho u_1^2 + p &amp;  \rho u_1u_2 &amp;  \rho u_1u_3
\\  \rho u_1 u_2 &amp; \rho u_2^2 + p &amp;  \rho u_2u_3
\\ \rho u_3 u_1 &amp;  \rho u_3 u_2 &amp;  \rho u_3^2 + p
\\ u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \rho \mathbf u  \\0\end{pmatrix}+ \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\rho \mathbf u\\\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + p \mathbf I\\ \mathbf u\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\  \rho \mathbf g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation variables===
The variables for the equations in conservation form are not yet optimised. In fact we could define:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\ \mathbf j  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf j \\ \frac {1} \rho \, \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j+ p \mathbf I\\ \frac \mathbf j \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf j = \rho \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] density, a conservation variable.

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equation(s)''' (''conservation or Eulerian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \mathbf j  \\0\end{pmatrix}+ \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf j \\ \frac 1 \rho \, \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + p \mathbf I\\ \frac \mathbf j \rho\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\  \mathbf f \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f = \rho \mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[force density]], a conservation variable.

==Euler equations==
In differential convective form, the compressible (and most general) Euler equations can be written shortly with the [[material derivative]] notation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations''' (''convective form'')
|equation=
&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D \rho\over Dt} = - \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u \\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = - \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{D e \over Dt} = -\frac p \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u  \end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FF0000
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where the additional variables here is:
*&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific [[internal energy]] (internal energy per unit mass).

The equations above thus represent [[conservation of mass]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of energy|energy]]: the energy equation expressed in the variable internal energy allows to understand the link with the incompressible case, but it is not in the simplest form.
Mass density, flow velocity and pressure are the so-called ''convective variables'' (or physical variables, or lagrangian variables), while mass density, momentum density and total energy density are the so-called ''[[conserved variables]]'' (also called eulerian, or mathematical variables).&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;
If one explicitates the material derivative the equations above are:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{\partial\rho\over\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0\\[1.2ex]
\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{\partial e \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot \nabla e + \frac p \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0\end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

===Incompressible constraint===
Coming back to the incompressible case, it now becomes apparent that the ''incompressible constraint'' typical of the former cases actually is a particular form valid for incompressible flows of the ''energy equation'', and not of the mass equation. In particular, the incompressible constraint corresponds to the following very simple energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over D t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus '''for an incompressible inviscid fluid the specific internal energy is constant along the [[flow lines]]''', also in a time-dependent flow. The pressure in an incompressible flow acts like a [[Lagrange multiplier]], being the multiplier of the incompressible constraint in the energy equation, and consequently in incompressible flows it has no thermodynamic meaning. In fact, thermodynamics is typical of compressible flows and degenerates in incompressible flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, Fluidodinamica comprimibile, Chap. 9, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho e \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho e \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

meaning that for an incompressible inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the internal energy.

===Enthalpy conservation===
Since by definition the specific enthalpy is:

&lt;math&gt;h = e + \frac p \rho &lt;/math&gt;

The material derivative of the specific internal energy can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = {D h \over Dt} - \frac 1 \rho \left({D p \over Dt} - \frac p \rho {D \rho \over Dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then by substituting the momentum equation in this expression, one obtains:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt}= {D h \over Dt} - \frac 1 \rho \left(p \nabla \cdot \mathbf u + {D p \over Dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

And by substituting the latter in the energy equation, one obtains that the enthalpy expression for the Euler energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D h \over Dt} = \frac 1 \rho {D p \over Dt} &lt;/math&gt;

'''In a reference frame moving with an inviscid and nonconductive flow, the variation of enthalpy directly corresponds to a variation of pressure.'''

===Thermodynamic systems===
In [[thermodynamics]] the independent variables are the [[specific volume]], and the [[specific entropy]], while the [[specific energy]] is a [[function of state]] of these two variables.

{{hidden
|Deduction of the form valid for thermodynamic systems
|Considering the first equation, variable must be changed from density to specific volume. By definition:

&lt;math&gt; v \equiv \frac 1 \rho &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the following identities hold:

&lt;math&gt; \nabla \rho =\nabla \left(\frac 1 v \right) = - \frac 1 {v^2} \nabla v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac {\partial}{\partial t} \left(\frac 1 v \right) = - \frac 1 {v^2} \frac {\partial v}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Then by substituting these expressions in the mass conservation equation:

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\mathbf{u}}{v^2} \cdot \nabla v - \frac 1 {v^2} \frac {\partial v}{\partial t} = - \frac 1 v \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

And by multiplication:

&lt;math&gt; {\partial v \over\partial t}+\mathbf u \cdot \nabla v = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this equation is the only belonging to general continuum equations, so only this equation have the same form for example also in Navier-Stokes equations.

On the other hand,  the pressure in thermodynamics is the opposite of the partial derivative of the specific internal energy with respect to the specific volume:

&lt;math&gt; p (v,s) = - {\partial e (v,s) \over \partial v}&lt;/math&gt;

since the internal energy in thermodynamics is a function of the two variables aforementioned, the pressure gradient contained into the momentum equation should be explicited as:

&lt;math&gt;- \nabla p (v,s) = - \frac {\partial p}{\partial v} \nabla v - \frac {\partial p}{\partial s} \nabla s = \frac {\partial^2 e}{\partial v^2} \nabla v +  \frac {\partial^2 e}{\partial v \partial s}\nabla s &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient for brevity to switch the notation for the second order derivatives:

&lt;math&gt; - \nabla p (v,s) =  e_{vv} \nabla v + e_{vs} \nabla s &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = - p v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

can be furtherly simplified in convective form by changing variable from specific energy to the specific entropy: in fact the [[first law of thermodynamics]] in local form can be written:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = T {D s \over Dt} - p {D v \over Dt}&lt;/math&gt;

by substituting the material derivative of the internal energy, the energy equation becomes:

&lt;math&gt;T {D s \over Dt} + \frac p {\rho^2} \left( {D \rho \over Dt} + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

now the term between parenthesis is identically zero according to the conservation of mass, then the Euler energy equation becomes simply:

&lt;math&gt;{D s \over Dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

For a thermodynamic fluid, the compressible Euler equations are consequently best written as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations''' (''convective form, for a thermodynamic system'')
|equation=:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D v \over Dt} = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = v e_{vv} \nabla v + v e_{vs} \nabla s + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{D s \over Dt} =0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FFFF00
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where:
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity vector
* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the specific entropy

Note that, in the general case and not only in the incompressible case, the energy equation means that '''for an inviscid thermodynamic fluid the specific entropy is constant along the [[flow lines]]''', also in a time-dependent flow. Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Lifshits, Fluid Mechanics, par. 1.1, eq. 2.6 and 2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho s \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho s \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

meaning that for an inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the entropy.

On the other hand, the two second-order partial derivatives of the specific internal energy in the momentum equation require the specification of the [[fundamental equation of state]] of the material considered, i.e. of the specific internal energy as function of the two variables specific volume and specific entropy:

&lt;math&gt;e = e(v,s)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the ''fundamental'' equation of state contains all the thermodynamic information about the system (Callen, 1985),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L.F. Henderson, ''par. 2.6 Thermodynamic properties of materials'', in Handbook of Shock Waves, p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; exactly like the couple of a ''thermal'' equation of state together with a ''caloric'' equation of state.

===Conservation form===
{{see also|Conservation equation|}}
The Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \mathbf j  \\E^t \end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf j\\ \frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + p \mathbf I\\(E^t +p) \frac \mathbf j \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf j = \rho \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] density, a conservation variable.
* &lt;math&gt;E^t = \rho e + 1/2 \rho u^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total energy]] density (total energy per unit volume).

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length N+2 and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size N(N+2).&lt;ref&gt;In 3D for example y has length 5, I has size 3x3 and F has size 3x5, so the explicit forms are:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}  j_1 \\ j_2  \\ j_3 \end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}j_1 &amp; j_2 &amp; j_3 \\
\frac{ j_1^2}\rho + p &amp;  \frac{j_1j_2}\rho&amp;  \frac{j_1j_3} \rho\\
\frac{j_1j_2}\rho &amp; \frac {j_2^2} \rho + p &amp;  \frac{j_2j_3} \rho\\
\frac{j_3j_1}\rho &amp;  \frac{j_3j_2}{\rho} &amp;  \frac {j_3^2} \rho + p \\
(E^t+p) \frac {j_1} \rho &amp; (E^t+p) \frac {j_2} \rho &amp; (E^t+p) \frac{j_3} \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equation(s)''' (''original conservation or Eulerian form'')
|equation=

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f = \rho \mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[force density]], a conservation variable.

We remark that also the Euler equation even when conservative (no external field, Froude limit) have '''no [[Riemann invariant]]s''' in general.&lt;ref&gt;Chorin, Marsden, ''A mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics'', par. 3.2 Shocks, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Some further assumptions are required

However, we already mentioned that for a thermodynamic fluid the equation for the total energy density is equivalent to the conservation equation:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial t} (\rho s) + \nabla \cdot (\rho s \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Then the conservation equations in the case of a thermodynamic fluid are more simply expressed as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equation(s)''' (''conservation form, for thermodynamic fluids'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \mathbf j  \\S \end{pmatrix}+ \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf j \\\frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + p \mathbf I\\S \frac \mathbf j \rho \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\  \mathbf f \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

}}

where:
* &lt;math&gt;S = \rho s&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy density, a thermodynamic conservation variable.

Another possible form for the energy equation, being particularly useful for [[isobaric process|isobarics]], is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial H^t  }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot (H^t \mathbf u) = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf f - \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;H^t = E^t + p = \rho e + p + 1/2 \rho u^2&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[enthalpy]] density.

==Quasilinear form and characteristic equations==
Expanding the [[flux]]es can be an important part of constructing [[numerical solution|numerical solvers]], for example by exploiting ([[approximation|approximate]]) solutions to the [[Riemann problem]]. In regions where the state vector '''''y''''' varies smoothly, the equations in conservative form can be put in quasilinear form :

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} + \mathbf A_i \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial r_i}  = {\mathbf 0}. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the flux [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]s defined as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf A_i (\mathbf y)=\frac{\partial \mathbf f_i (\mathbf y)}{\partial \mathbf y}. &lt;/math&gt;

Obviously this Jacobian does not exist in discontinuity regions (e.g. contact discontinuities, shock waves in inviscid nonconductive flows). Note that if the flux Jacobians &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_i&lt;/math&gt; are not functions of the state vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt;, the equations reveals ''linear''.

===Characteristic equations===
The compressible Euler equations can be decoupled into a set of N+2 [[wave]] equations that describes [[sound]] in Eulerian continuum if they are expressed in [[method of characteristics|characteristic variables]] instead of conserved variables.

In fact the tensor '''A''' is always [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]. If the [[eigenvalue]]s (the case of Euler equations) are all real the system is defined ''hyperbolic'', and physically eigenvalues represent the speeds of propagation of information.&lt;ref&gt;Toro, Rienmann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics, par 2.1 Quasi-linear Equations: Basic concept, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; If they are all distinguished, the system is defined ''strictly hyperbolic'' (it will be proved to be the case of one-dimensional Euler equations). Furthermore, note that diagonalisation of compressible Euler equation is easier when the energy equation is expressed in the variable entropy (i.e. with equations for thermodynamic fluids) than in other energy variables. This will become clear by considering the 1D case.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[right eigenvector]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[eigenvalue]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, by building the [[projection matrix]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=[ \mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, ... , \mathbf{p}_n]&lt;/math&gt;

One can finally find the ''characteristic variables'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}= \mathbf{P}^{-1}\mathbf{y},&lt;/math&gt;

Since '''A''' is constant, multiplying the original 1-D equation in flux-Jacobian form with '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; yields the characteristic equations:&lt;ref&gt;Toro, ''op. cit.'', par 2.3 Linear Hyperbolic System, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial w_i}{\partial t} + \lambda_j \frac{\partial w_i}{\partial r_j} = 0_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The original equations have been [[Linear independence|decoupled]] into N+2 characteristic equations each describing a simple wave, with the eigenvalues being the wave speeds.  The variables ''w''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are called the ''characteristic variables'' and are a subset of the conservative variables. The solution of the initial value problem in terms of characteristic variables is finally very simple. In one spatial dimension it is:

:&lt;math&gt;
w_i (x, t)  = w_i (x-\lambda_i t, 0)  
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the solution in terms of the original conservative variables is obtained by transforming back:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}= \mathbf{P} \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

this computation can be explicited as the linear combination of the eigenvectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(x,t) = \sum_{i=1}^m w_i (x-\lambda_i t, 0) \mathbf p_i,&lt;/math&gt;

Now it becomes apparent that the characteristic variables act as weights in the linear combination of the jacobian eigenvectors. The solution can be seen as superposition of waves, each of which is advected independently without change in shape. Each ''i''-th wave has shape ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and speed of propagation ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the following we show a very simple example of this solution procedure.

===Waves in 1D inviscid, nonconductive thermodynamic fluid===
If one considers Euler equations for a thermodynamic fluid with the two further assumptions of one spatial dimension and free (no external field: ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) :

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{\partial v \over  \partial t} + u {\partial v \over  \partial x} - v {\partial u \over  \partial x} = 0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial u \over  \partial t} + u {\partial u \over  \partial x} - e_{vv} v {\partial v \over  \partial x}- e_{vs} v {\partial s \over  \partial x} = 0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial s \over  \partial t} + u {\partial s \over  \partial x} = 0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

If one defines the vector of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ u  \\s \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

recalling that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the flow speed, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the specific entropy, the corresponding jacobian matrix is:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf A}=\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; u \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

At first one must find the eigenvalues of this matrix by solving the [[characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf A (\mathbf y)-\lambda (\mathbf y) \mathbf I))=0&lt;/math&gt;

that is explicitly:

: &lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}u-\lambda &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u-\lambda &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; u-\lambda \end{bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

This [[determinant]] is very simple: the fastest computation starts on the last row, since it has the highest number of  zero elements.

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \det \begin{bmatrix}u-\lambda &amp; -v \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u -\lambda \end{bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now by computing the determinant 2x2:

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \left( (u-\lambda)^2 - e_{vv} v^2 \right) =0&lt;/math&gt;

by defining the parameter:

: &lt;math&gt;a(v,s) \equiv v \sqrt {e_{vv}} &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently in mechanical variables, as:

: &lt;math&gt;a(\rho,p) \equiv \sqrt {\partial p \over \partial \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

This parameter is always real according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In fact the second law of thermodynamics can be expressed by several postulates. The most elementary of them in mathematical terms is the statement of convexity of the fundamental equation of state, i.e. the [[hessian matrix]] of the specific energy expressed as function of specific volume and specific entropy:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}e_{vv} &amp; e_{vs} \\ e_{vs} &amp; e_{ss} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is defined positive. This statement corresponds to the two conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
e_{vv}&gt;0\\[1.2ex]
e_{vv}e_{ss}-e_{vs}^2 &gt; 0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

The first condition is the one ensuring the parameter ''a'' is defined real.

The characteristic equation finally results:

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \left( (u-\lambda)^2 - a^2 \right) =0&lt;/math&gt;

That has three real solutions:

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(v,u,s) = u-a(v,s) \quad \lambda_2(u)= u, \quad \lambda_3(v,u,s) = u+a(v,s)&lt;/math&gt;

Then the matrix has three real eigenvalues all distinguished: the 1D Euler equations are a '''strictly hyperbolic system'''.

At this point one should determine the three eigenvectors: each one is obtained by substituting one eigenvalue in the eigenvalue equation and then solving it. By substituting the first eigenvalue &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; one obtains:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a  &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; a &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ u_1  \\s_1 \end{pmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Basing on the third equation that simply has solution s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0, the system reduces to:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a  &amp; -v \\-a^2 /v&amp; a  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ u_1 \end{pmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The two equations are redundant as usual, then the eigenvector is defined with a multiplying constant. We choose as right eigenvector:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_1=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ a  \\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The other two eigenvectors can be found with analogous procedure as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_2=\begin{pmatrix} e_{vs} \\ 0\\ - \left(\frac a v \right)^2 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mathbf p_3=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ -a \\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the projection matrix can be built:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf P (v,u,s)=( \mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \mathbf{p}_3) =\begin{pmatrix} v &amp; e_{vs} &amp; v\\ a &amp; 0 &amp; -a \\ 0 &amp;  - \left(\frac a v \right)^2 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally it becomes apparent that the real parameter ''a'' previously defined is the speed of propagation of the information characteristic of the hyperbolic system made of Euler equations, i.e. it is the ''[[group velocity|wave speed]]''. It remains to be shown that the sound speed corresponds to the particular case of an [[isoentropic transformation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s \equiv \sqrt {\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s} &lt;/math&gt;

===Compressibility and sound speed===
Sound speed is defined as the wavespeed of an isentropic transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s(\rho,p) \equiv \sqrt {\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s} &lt;/math&gt;

by the definition of the isoentropic compressibility:

:&lt;math&gt;K_s (\rho,p) \equiv \frac 1 \rho \left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s &lt;/math&gt;

the soundspeed results always the square root of ratio between the isoentropic compressibility and the density:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s \equiv \sqrt {\frac {K_s} \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

====Ideal gas====
The sound speed in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (T) = \sqrt {\gamma \frac T m} &lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
|Deduction of the form valid for ideal gases
|In an ideal gas the isoentropic transformation is described by the [[Poisson's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;d (p \rho^{-\gamma})_s =0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;gamma;'' is the [[heat capacity ratio]], a constant for the material. By explicitating the differentials:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{-\gamma} (d p)_s + \gamma p \rho^{-\gamma-1} (d \rho)_s =0&lt;/math&gt;

and by dividing for ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sup&gt;−''&amp;gamma;''&lt;/sup&gt; d''&amp;rho;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s= \gamma p \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Then by substitution in the general definitions for an ideal gas the isentropic compressibility is simply proportional to the pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;K_s (p) = \gamma p &lt;/math&gt;

and the sound speed results ('''Newton–Laplace law'''):

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (\rho,p) = \sqrt {\gamma \frac p \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

Notably, for an ideal gas the [[ideal gas law]] holds, that in mathematical form is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;  p = n T &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the [[number density]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]], provided it is measured in ''energetic units'' (i.e. in [[joules]]) through multiplication with the [[Boltzmann constant]]. Since the mass density is proportional to the number density through the average [[molecular mass]] ''m'' of the material:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = m n &lt;/math&gt;

The ideal gas law can be recast into the formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac p \rho = \frac T m &lt;/math&gt;

By substituting this ratio in the Newton–Laplace law, the expression of the sound speed into an ideal gas as function of  temperature is finally achieved.

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

Since the specific enthalpy in an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;h = c_p  T = \frac {\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac T m &lt;/math&gt;

the sound speed in an ideal gas can also be made dependent only on its specific enthalpy:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (h) = \sqrt {(\gamma -1) h} &lt;/math&gt;

==Bernoulli's theorem for steady inviscid flow==

[[ Bernoulli's theorem]] is a direct consequence of the Euler equations.

===Incompressible case and Lamb's form===
The [[vector calculus identity]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)#Identities|cross product of a curl]] holds:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v \  \times } \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \times F} \right) =\nabla_F \left( \mathbf{v \cdot F } \right) - \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla } \mathbf{ F} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the Feynman subscript notation &lt;math&gt;\nabla_F&lt;/math&gt; is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Horace Lamb|Lamb]] in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895), still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}}[http://web2srv.ing.uniroma1.it/~m_valorani/GasTurbines_LM_files/DispenseTurboMacchine.pdf Valorani, Nasuti, Metodi di analisi delle turbomacchine], pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u = \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

the Euler momentum equation in Lamb's form becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g} 
=\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) - \mathbf u\times(\nabla \times \mathbf u)     + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Lamb form}}

Now, basing on the other identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left( \frac {p}{\rho} \right) = \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} - \frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho &lt;/math&gt;

the Euler momentum equation assumes a form that is optimal to demonstrate [[Bernoulli's theorem]] for steady flows:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left(\frac 1 2 u^2 + \frac p \rho \right) - \mathbf g =  - \frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, in case of an external [[conservative field]], by defining its potential &amp;phi;:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla  \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) =  -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a ''[[streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]'', the cross product disappears because its result is always perpendicular to the velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla  \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) = -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho  &lt;/math&gt;

In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;

, that is '''the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant'''.  Then the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The convenience of defining the [[total head]] for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent:

:&lt;math&gt; b_l \equiv \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho , &lt;/math&gt;

which may be simply written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_l = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, '''the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant'''.

===Compressible case ===
In the most general steady (compressibile) case the mass equation in conservation form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf j = \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt; .

Therefore, the previous expression is rather

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \left({\frac {1}{2}}u^{2}+\phi +{\frac {p}{\rho }}\right)= \frac {p}{\rho}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u}    &lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side appears on the energy equation in convective form, which on the steady state reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla  e =  - \frac{p}{\rho}  \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

The energy equation therefore becomes:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( e + \frac p \rho + \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi \right) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

so that the internal specific energy now features in the head.

Since the external field potential is usually small compared to the other terms, it is convenient to group the latter ones in the [[total enthalpy]]:

:&lt;math&gt; h^t \equiv e + \frac p \rho + \frac 1 2 u^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Bernoulli invariant]] for an inviscid gas flow is:

:&lt;math&gt; b_g \equiv h^t + \phi = b_l + e , &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_g = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, '''the energy balance for a steady inviscid flow in an external conservative field states that the sum of the total enthalpy and the external potential is constant along a streamline'''.

In the usual case of small potential field, simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla h^t \sim 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Friedman form and Crocco form===
{{see also|Crocco's theorem}}
By substituting the pressure gradient with the entropy and enthalpy gradient, according to the first law of thermodynamics in the enthalpy form:

:&lt;math&gt;v \nabla p = -T \nabla s + \nabla h&lt;/math&gt;

in the convective form of Euler momentum equation, one arrives to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D\mathbf u}{Dt}=T \nabla\,s-\nabla \,h&lt;/math&gt;

[[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] deduced this equation for the particular case of a [[perfect gas]] and published it in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Friedmann A. An essay on hydrodynamics of compressible fluid (Опыт гидромеханики сжимаемой жидкости), [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], 1922, 516 p., [http://books.e-heritage.ru/book/10073889 reprinted] in 1934 under the editorship of [[Nikolai Kochin]] (see the first formula on page 198 of the reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this equation is general for an inviscid nonconductive fluid and no equation of state is implicit in it.

On the other hand, by substituting the enthalpy form of the first law of thermodynamics in the rotational form of Euler momentum equation, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

and by defining the specific total enthalpy:

:&lt;math&gt; h^t =h + \frac 1 2 u^2&lt;/math&gt;

one arrives to the '''[[Crocco's theorem|Crocco–Vazsonyi form]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook of Shock Waves, Vol I, par. 2.12 Crocco's theorem, p.177]&lt;/ref&gt; (Crocco, 1937) of the Euler momentum equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  - T \nabla s + \nabla h^t = \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

In the steady case the two variables entropy and total enthalpy are particularly useful since Euler equations can be recast into the Crocco's form:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\begin{align}   \mathbf u  \times \nabla \times \mathbf u + T \nabla s - \nabla h^t = \mathbf{g} \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla s = 0 \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla h^t = 0  \end{align} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

Finally if the flow is also isothermal:

&lt;math&gt;T \nabla s = \nabla (T s)&lt;/math&gt;

by defining the specific total [[Gibbs free energy]]:

&lt;math&gt; g^t \equiv h^t + Ts &lt;/math&gt;

the Crocco's form can be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\begin{align}   \mathbf u  \times \nabla \times \mathbf u - \nabla g^t = \mathbf{g} \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla g^t = 0  \end{align} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

From these relationships one deduces that the specific total free energy is uniform in a steady, irrotational, isothermal, isoentropic, inviscid flow.

==Discontinuities==
{{see also|Shock waves|Burgers equation}}
The Euler equations are [[Differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations and their general solutions are [[wave]]s. Under certain assumptions they can be simplified leading to [[Burgers equation]]. Much like the familiar oceanic [[waves and shallow water|waves]], waves described by the Euler Equations [[breaking wave|'break']] and so-called [[shock waves]] are formed; this is a nonlinear effect and represents the solution becoming [[multi-valued function|multi-valued]]. Physically this represents a breakdown of the assumptions that led to the formulation of the differential equations, and to extract further information from the equations we must go back to the more fundamental integral form. Then, [[weak solution]]s are formulated by working in 'jumps' (discontinuities) into the flow quantities – density, velocity, pressure, entropy – using the [[Rankine–Hugoniot equations]]. Physical quantities are rarely discontinuous; in real flows, these discontinuities are smoothed out by [[viscosity]] and by [[heat transfer]]. (See [[Navier–Stokes equations]])

Shock propagation is studied – among many other fields – in [[aerodynamics]] and [[rocket|rocket propulsion]], where sufficiently fast flows occur.

To properly compute the continuum quantities in discontinuous zones (for example shock waves or boundary layers) from the ''local'' forms&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the local and the global forms are also called respectively ''differential'' and ''non-differential'', but this is not appropriate in all cases. For example, this is appropriate for Euler equations, while it is not for Navier-Stokes equations since in their global form there are some residual spatial first-order derivative operators in all the caractheristic transport terms that in the local form contains second-order spatial derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt; (all the above forms are local forms, since the variables being described are typical of one point in the space caonsidered, i.e. they are ''local variables'') of Euler equations through [[finite difference method]]s generally too many space points and time steps would be necessary for the memory of computers now and in the near future. In these cases it is mandatory to avoid the local forms of the conservation equations, passing some [[weak formulation|weak forms]], like the [[finite volume method|finite volume one]].

===Rankine–Hugoniot equations===
Starting from the simplest case, one consider a steady free conservation equation in conservation form in the space domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where in general '''F''' is the flux matrix. By integrating this local equation over a fixed volume V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{V_m} \nabla \cdot \mathbf F dV = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, basing on the [[divergence theorem]], we can transform this integral in a boundary integral of the flux:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F ds = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This ''global form'' simply states that there is no net flux of a conserved quantity passing through a region in the case steady and without source. In 1D the volume reduces to an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], its boundary being its extrema, then the divergence theorem reduces to the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_m}^{x_{m+1}} \mathbf F(x') dx' = \mathbf 0,&lt;/math&gt;

that is the simple [[finite difference equation]], known as the ''jump relation'':

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf F = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

That can be made explicit as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F_{m+1} - \mathbf F_m= \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation employed is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F_{m}=\mathbf F(x_m).&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if one performs an indefinite integral:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F - \mathbf F_0= \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, a transient conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial y \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

brings to a jump relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d x}{dt} \,  \Delta u = \Delta \mathbf F.&lt;/math&gt;

For one-dimensional Euler equations the conservation variables and the flux are the vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf y = \begin{pmatrix} 1/v \\ j \\ E^t \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = \begin{pmatrix} j \\ v j^2 + p \\ v j (E^t + p) \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume,
* &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the mass flux.

In the one dimensional case the correspondent jump relations, called the [[Rankine–Hugoniot equation]]s, are:&lt;ref&gt;Chorin, Marsden, A mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics, par. 3.2 Shocks, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta (1/v) = \Delta j \\[1.2ex]
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta j = \Delta (v j^2 +p)\\[1.2ex]
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta E^t = \Delta (j v (E^t + p))\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

In the steady one dimensional case the become simply:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (v j^2 +p) = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (j (\frac {E^t} \rho + \frac p \rho))= 0\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

Thanks to the mass difference equation, the energy difference equation can be simplified without any restriction:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (v j^2 + p)= 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta h^t = 0\end{align}\right.,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h^t&lt;/math&gt; is the specific total enthalpy.

These are the usually expressed in the convective variables:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (\frac {u^2} v + p)= 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta  \left(e + \frac 1 2 u^2 + p v \right) = 0 \end{align}\right.,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow speed
* &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific internal energy.

Note that the energy equation is an integral form of the '''Bernoulli equation''' in the compressible case. 
The former mass and momentum equations by substitution lead to the Rayleigh equation:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v} = - \frac {u_0^2}{v_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the second member is a constant, the Rayleigh equation always describes a simple [[line (geometry)|line]] in the [[pressure volume diagram|pressure volume plane]] not depending of any equation of state, i.e. the [[Rayleigh line]].
By substituition in the Rankine–Hugoniot equations, that can be also made explicit as:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\rho u = \rho_0 u_0\\[1.2ex]
\rho u^2 + p= \rho_0 u_0^2 + p_0\\[1.2ex]
e + \frac 1 2 u^2 + \frac p \rho = e_0 + \frac 1 2 u_0^2 + \frac {p_0}{\rho_0} \end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

One can also obtain the kinetic equation and to the Hugoniot equation. The analytical passages are not shown here for brevity.

{{see also|Rayleigh equation|Hugoniot equation}}

These are respectively:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
u^2(v,p) = u_0^2 + (p-p_0)(v_0+v)\\[1.2ex]
e(v,p)= e_0 + \frac 1 2 (p+p_0)(v_0-v)\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

The Hugoniot equation, coupled with the fundamental equation of state of the material:

&lt;math&gt; e = e(v,p)&lt;/math&gt;

describes in general in the pressure volume plane a curve passing by the conditions (v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), i.e. the [[Hugoniot curve]], whose shape strongly depends on the type of material considered.

It is also customary to define a ''Hugoniot function'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L.F. Henderson, ''par. 2.96 The Bethe–Weyl theorem'', in Handbook of Shock Waves, p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak h (v,s) \equiv e(v,s) - e_0 +\frac 1 2 (p(v,s) + p_0) (v -v_0) &lt;/math&gt;

allowing to quantify deviations from the Hugoniot equation, similarly to the previous definition of the ''hydraulic head'', useful for the deviations from the Bernoulli equation.

===Finite volume form===
On the other hand, by integrating a generic conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} +\nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf s &lt;/math&gt;

on a fixed volume V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and then basing on the [[divergence theorem]], it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d}{dt} \int_{V_m} \mathbf y dV + \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F \cdot \hat n ds = \mathbf S .&lt;/math&gt;

By integrating this equation also over a time interval:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_{n+1}) \, dV - \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_n) \, dV+ \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F \cdot \hat n \, ds \, dt = \mathbf 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Now by defining the node conserved quantity:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y_{m,n} \equiv \frac 1 {V_m} \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_n) \, dV ,&lt;/math&gt;

we deduce the finite volume form:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_{m,n+1}=\mathbf{y}_{m,n} - \frac{1}{V_m} \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{n}\, ds \, dt .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for Euler equations, once the conserved quantities have been determined, the convective variables are deduced by back substitution:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\mathbf u_{m,n} = \frac {\mathbf j_{m,n}}{\rho_{m,n}}\\[1.2ex]
e_{m,n} = \frac {E^t_{m,n}}{\rho_{m,n}} -\frac 1 2 u^2_{m,n}\\[1.2ex]
\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

Then the explicit finite volume expressions of the original convective variables are:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, ''Fluidodinamica comprimibile'', par. 11.10: Forma differenziale: metodo dei volumi finiti, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constraints==
It has been shown that Euler equations are not a complete set of equations, but they require some additional constraints to admit a unique solution: these are the [[equation of state]] of the material considered. To be consistent with [[thermodynamics]] these equations of state should satisfy the two laws of thermodynamics. On the other hand, by definition non-equilibrium system are described by laws lying outside these laws. In the following we list some very simple equations of state and the corresponding influence on Euler equations.

===Ideal polytropic gas===
{{see also|ideal gas}}
For an ideal polytropic gas the fundamental [[equation of state]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, Fluidodinamica comprimibile, Appendix E, p. A-61&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; e (v,s) = e_0 e^{ (\gamma - 1) m (s - s_0)} \left({v_0 \over v}\right)^{\gamma -1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific energy, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the specific entropy, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; here is considered a constant ([[polytropic process]]), and can be shown to correspond to the [[heat capacity ratio]]. This equation can be shown to be consistent with the usual equations of state employed by thermodynamics.

{{hidden
|Demonstration of consistency with the thermodynamics of an ideal gas
|By the thermodynamic definition of temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;T(e) \equiv {\partial e \over \partial s} = (\gamma - 1) m e&lt;/math&gt;

Where the temperature is measured in energy units. At first, note that by combining these two equations one can deduce the '''[[ideal gas law]]''':

:&lt;math&gt;p v = m T&lt;/math&gt;

or, in the usual form:

:&lt;math&gt;p = n T&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;n \equiv \frac m v&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of the material. On the other hand the ideal gas law is less strict than the original fundamental equation of state considered.

Now consider the molar heat capacity associated to a process ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;c_x = \left(m T {\partial s \over \partial T}\right)_x&lt;/math&gt;

according to the first law of thermodynamics:

:&lt;math&gt;d e(v,s)=-p dv + T \, ds&lt;/math&gt;

it can be simply expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;c_x \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_x + m p \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_x&lt;/math&gt;

Now inverting the equation for temperature T(e) we deduce that for an ideal polytropic gas the isocoric heat capacity is a constant:

:&lt;math&gt;c_v \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_v = m {d e \over dT} = \frac {1}{(\gamma -1)}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for an ideal polytropic gas the isobaric heat capacity results constant:

:&lt;math&gt;c_p \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_p + m p  \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_p = m {d e \over dT} + p \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_p = \frac {1}{(\gamma -1)} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

This brings to two important [[relations between heat capacities]]: the constant gamma actually represents the '''[[heat capacity ratio]]''' in the ideal polytropic gas:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {c_p}{c_v}= \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

and one also arrives to the '''Meyer's relation''':

:&lt;math&gt;c_p = c_v+1&lt;/math&gt;

The specific energy is then, by inverting the relation T(e):

:&lt;math&gt;e(T) = \frac {mT} {\gamma - 1} = c_v m T&lt;/math&gt;

The specific enthalpy results by substitution of the latter and of the ideal gas law:

:&lt;math&gt;h(T) \equiv e(T) + (p v)(T) = c_v m T + m T = c_p m T&lt;/math&gt;

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

From this equation one can derive the equation for pressure by its thermodynamic definition:

:&lt;math&gt;p(v,e) \equiv - {\partial e \over \partial v} = (\gamma - 1) \frac e v&lt;/math&gt;

By inverting it one arrives to the mechanical equation of state:

:&lt;math&gt;e(v,p) = \frac {pv}{\gamma - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Then for an ideal gas the compressible Euler equations can be simply expressed in the ''mechanical'' or ''primitive variables'' specific volume, flow velocity and pressure, by taking the set of the equations for a thermodynamic system and modifying the energy equation into a pressure equation through this mechanical equation of state. At last, in convective form they result:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations for an ideal polytropic gas''' (''convective form'')&lt;ref&gt;Toro, par 3.1.2 Nonconservative formulations, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

{D v \over Dt} = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = v \nabla p + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{Dp \over Dt} = - \gamma p \nabla \cdot \mathbf u
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

and in one-dimensional quasilinear form they results:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} + \mathbf A \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial x}  = {\mathbf 0}. &lt;/math&gt;

where the conservative vector variable is:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ u  \\p \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding jacobian matrix is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/compressible/Euler.pdf M. Zingale, Notes on the Euler equations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toro, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf A}=\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; u &amp; v \\ 0 &amp; \gamma p &amp; u \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Steady flow in material coordinates {{anchor|Steady flow in streamline coordinates}} ===
In the case of steady flow, it is convenient to choose the [[Frenet–Serret frame]] along a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]] as the [[coordinate system]] for describing the steady [[momentum]] Euler equation:&lt;ref name="Fay"&gt;
{{cite book
|author=James A. Fay
|title=Introduction to Fluid Mechanics
|publisher=MIT Press
|date=June 1994
|isbn=0-262-06165-1
}} see "4.5 Euler's Equation in Streamline Coordinates" pp. 150–152 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=XGVpue4954wC&amp;pg=150&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p,
&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[flow velocity]], the [[pressure]] and the [[density]], respectively.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf e_s, \mathbf e_n, \mathbf e_b \}&lt;/math&gt; be a Frenet–Serret [[orthonormal basis]] which consists of a tangential unit vector, a normal unit vector, and a binormal unit vector to the streamline, respectively.
Since a streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the left-handed side of the above equation, the [[convective derivative]] of velocity, can be described as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{u} \\
&amp;= u\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(u\boldsymbol{e}_s)
     &amp;(\boldsymbol{u} = u \boldsymbol{e}_s ,~ 
      {\partial / \partial s} \equiv \boldsymbol{e}_s\cdot\nabla)\\
&amp;= u\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\boldsymbol{e}_s 
+ \frac{u^2}{R} \boldsymbol{e}_n &amp;(\because~ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{e}_s}{\partial s}=\frac{1}{R}\boldsymbol{e}_n),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the streamline.

Therefore, the momentum part of the Euler equations for a steady flow is found to have a simple form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\displaystyle u\frac{\partial u}{\partial s} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial s},\\
\displaystyle {u^2 \over R}                  = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}    &amp;({\partial / \partial n}\equiv\boldsymbol{e}_n\cdot\nabla),\\
\displaystyle 0                              = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial b} &amp;({\partial / \partial b}\equiv\boldsymbol{e}_b\cdot\nabla).
\end{cases} 
&lt;/math&gt;

For [[barotropic]] flow &lt;math&gt;(\rho = \rho(p))&lt;/math&gt;, [[Bernoulli's equation]] is derived from the first equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\left(\frac{u^2}{2} + \int \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\rho}\right) =0.
&lt;/math&gt; 
The second equation expresses that, in the case the streamline is curved, there should exist a [[pressure gradient]] normal to the streamline because the [[centripetal acceleration]] of the [[fluid parcel]] is only generated by the normal pressure gradient.

The third equation expresses that pressure is constant along the binormal axis.

==== Streamline curvature theorem ====
[[File:Streamlines around a NACA 0012.svg|frame|right|
The "Streamline curvature theorem" states that the pressure at the upper surface of an airfoil is lower than the pressure far away and that the pressure at the lower surface is higher than the pressure far away; hence the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil generates a lift force.
]]

Let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be the distance from the center of curvature of the streamline, 
then the second equation is written as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} = \rho \frac{u^2}{r}~(&gt;0),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\partial / \partial r} = -{\partial /\partial n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation states:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
''In a steady flow of an [[inviscid]] [[fluid]] without external forces, the [[center of curvature]] of the streamline lies in the direction of decreasing radial pressure.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this relationship between the pressure field and flow curvature is very useful, it doesn't have a name in the English-language scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Babinsky&gt;{{citation

This "theorem" explains clearly why there are such low pressures in the centre of [[vortex|vortices]],&lt;ref name=Babinsky/&gt; which consist of concentric circles of streamlines.
This also is a way to intuitively explain why airfoils generate [[lift (force)|lift forces]].&lt;ref name=Babinsky/&gt;

==Exact solutions==

Evolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E.S., 2013. Evolutionary economics: post-Schumpeterian contributions. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the "[[rational choice]]" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012.

&lt;/ref&gt;.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Friedman (1998).  "On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory," ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p62cu1yy9tkljh5l/ 15]-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Witt (2008). "evolutionary economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&amp;q=evolutinary%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. Basic economic concepts such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Paul H. Rubin and C. Monica Capra. The evolutionary psychology of economics. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

==Predecessors==
In the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] presented a schema of stages of historical development, by introducing the notion that [[human nature]] was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system; on the contrary, he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred.

Marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing [[economic system]]s; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them incapable of surviving over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomicSystems"&gt;''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ("[[speciation]]").

This was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more "modern" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.

=== Veblen (1898) ===

[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term "evolutionary economics" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal "human nature" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between "industrial" and "pecuniary" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the "ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy" (Hodgson 2004);

Veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the "life process", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ("invidious distinctions") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the "instrumental" (read: "technological") aspects of group life. The "ceremonial" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; "instrumental" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The "Veblenian dichotomy" was a specialized variant of the "[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].

Arguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for subsequent generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction to the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.

Both are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. "Instrumental" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.

A seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Armen A. Alchian 1950, "Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.

More narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]&lt;ref&gt;Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Penrose]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&lt;/ref&gt; offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word "Entwicklung", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word "development" from the French "développement", as opposed to "evolution" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word "evolution".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].

In Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like "the normal mode of economic affairs". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Present state of discussion ==
One of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.

Then, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steady change]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma &amp; Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).

[[Milton Friedman]] proposed that [[Market (economics)|market]]s act as major selection vehicles. As [[corporation|firm]]s compete, unsuccessful rivals fail to capture an appropriate [[market share]], go [[bankrupt]] and have to exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Mariana Mazzucato |last=Mazzucato |first=Mariana |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/22206/ |year=2000 |title=Firm Size, Innovation and Market Structure: The Evolution of Market Concentration and Instability |journal=Advances in Complex Systems |volume=3 |pages=417–431 |publisher=Edward Elgar |location=Northampton, MA |isbn=978-1-84064-346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of competing firms is both in their products and practices, that are matched against markets. Both products and practices are determined by routines that firms use: standardized patterns of actions implemented constantly. By imitating these routines, firms propagate them and thus establish inheritance of successful practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]] (1953). ''[[Essays in Positive Economics]]'', University of Chicago Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSGekjfpf4cC&amp;printsec=toc&amp;dq=friedman+essays&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Chapter preview links.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 251: [[Jon Elster]], ''Explaining Technical Change : a Case Study in the Philosophy of Science'', Second ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general theory of this process has been proposed by Kurt Dopfer, John Foster and Jason Potts as the micro meso macro framework.&lt;ref&gt;Dopfer, K., Foster, J., Potts, J. (2004). Micro-meso-macro. Journal of Evolutionary Economics. 14(3), 263-279&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic processes, as part of life processes, are intrinsically evolutionary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;. From the evolutionary equation that describe life processes, an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes, such as fixed cost and variable cost, can be derived. The economic return, or competitiveness, of economic entities of different characteristics under different kinds of environment can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems. This is the process of evolution of economic systems.

In recent years, evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification.&lt;ref&gt;Baltas, G., Tsafarakis, S., Saridakis, C. &amp; Matsatsinis, N. (2013). Biologically Inspired Approaches to Strategic Service Design: Optimal Service Diversification Through Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Models. ''Journal of Service Research'' 16 (2), 186-201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary psychology ==
{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}
A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

People are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

Another argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

There may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

[[File:Amplop hijau.jpg|thumb|Green envelopes in Indonesia (2016)]]
A '''green envelope''' (Malay: '''''sampul hijau''''' or '''''sampul duit raya''''') is a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] adaptation of the Chinese [[red envelope]] custom. During the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Islam in Malaysia|Muslims in Malaysia]], [[Islam in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Islam in Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]] hand out money in green [[envelope]]s to guests who visit their homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://design-cu.jp/iasdr2013/papers/1893-1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The colour [[Green#Green_in_Islam|green]] was chosen for its association with the [[Islamic paradise]]. The idea of handing out green envelopes is based on the Islamic concept of ''[[zakat]]'', where every Muslim is required to provide at least 2.5% of their wealth to the needy. However, Malays now hand out these green envelopes during ''Aidilfitri'' not only to their poor guests, but also to the [[middle class]] and to the [[upper class]]. The amount of money depends on how much the host can afford to give their guests.

== Four principles ==
''How to Solve It'' suggests the following steps when solving a [[mathematical problem]]:
# First, you have to ''[[understanding|understand]] the [[problem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;
# After understanding, ''[[plan|make a plan]]''.&lt;ref name="Pólya 1957"&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.8-12&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Carry out the plan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.12-14&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Review|Look back]]'' on your work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; [[scientific method|How could it be better]]?

If this technique fails, Pólya advises:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p114&lt;/ref&gt;  "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it." Or: "If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?"

=== First principle: Understand the problem ===

"Understand the problem" is often neglected as being obvious and is not even mentioned in many mathematics classes. Yet students are often stymied in their efforts to solve it, simply because they don't understand it fully, or even in part. In order to remedy this oversight, Pólya taught teachers how to prompt each student with appropriate questions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p33&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the situation, such as:

* What are you asked to find or show?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p214&lt;/ref&gt;
* Can you restate the problem in your own words?
* Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the problem?
* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
* Do you need to ask a question to get the answer?

The teacher is to select the question with the appropriate level of difficulty for each student to ascertain if each student understands at their own level, moving up or down the list to prompt each student, until each one can respond with something constructive.

=== Second principle: Devise a plan ===

Pólya mentions that there are many reasonable ways to solve problems.&lt;ref name="Pólya 1957"/&gt; The skill at choosing an appropriate strategy is best learned by solving many problems. You will find choosing a strategy increasingly easy. A partial list of strategies is included:

* Guess and check&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p99&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make an orderly list&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eliminate possibilities&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p94&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p199&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider special cases&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p190&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use direct reasoning
* Solve an equation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p172 Pólya advises teachers that asking students to immerse themselves in routine operations only, instead of enhancing their imaginative / judicious side is inexcusable.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also suggested:

* Look for a pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p108&lt;/ref&gt;
* Draw a picture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp103-108&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solve a simpler problem&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p114 Pólya notes that 'human superiority consists in going around an obstacle that cannot be overcome directly'&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use a model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p105, p29-32, for example, Pólya discusses the problem of water flowing into a cone as an example of what is required to visualize the problem, using a figure.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Work backward&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p105, p225&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use a formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp141-148. Pólya describes the method of ''analysis''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be creative&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p172 (Pólya advises that this requires that the student have the patience to wait until the bright idea appears (subconsciously).)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applying these rules to devise a plan takes your own skill and judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp148-149. In the dictionary entry 'Pedantry &amp; mastery' Pólya cautions pedants to 'always use your own brains first'&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third principle: Carry out the plan ===

This step is usually easier than devising the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p.35&lt;/ref&gt; In general, all you need is care and patience, given that you have the necessary skills. Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work, discard it and choose another. Don't be misled; this is how mathematics is done, even by professionals.

=== Fourth principle: Review/extend ===

Pólya mentions that much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you have done, what worked and what didn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; Doing this will enable you to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems, if these relate to the original problem.

== Heuristics ==
The book contains a dictionary-style set of [[heuristics]], many of which have to do with generating a more accessible problem. For example:

'''Judgement''' (or '''judgment''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/judgement.html Judgement or Judgment?] - Choices in [[terminology|terminological]] spelling and usage.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[evaluation]] of [[evidence]] to [[make a decision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=43009&amp;dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/judgement?view=uk |title=AskOxford.com |publisher=AskOxford.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/judgement LDOCEonline]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has four distinct uses:
* Informal – [[opinion]]s expressed as facts. 
* Informal and [[psychological]] – used in reference to the quality of [[Mind|cognitive faculties]] and adjudicational capabilities of particular individuals, typically called ''[[wisdom]]'' or ''[[discernment]]''.
* Legal – used in the context of legal [[trial]], to refer to a final [[judgment (law)|finding, statement, or ruling]], based on a considered weighing of evidence, called, "''[[adjudication]]''". See [[Judgment (law)#Spelling|spelling note]] for further explanation. 
* Religious – used in the concept of [[salvation]] to refer to the ''[[divine judgement|adjudication of God]]'' in determining [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]] for each and all human beings. God's assessment of a person's worth: a determination of "good" conveys great value while "evil" conveys worthless.

Additionally, judgement can mean:
* [[Personality judgment]], a psychological phenomenon of a person forming opinions of other people.

'''Kinesis''', like a [[taxis]] or [[tropism]], is a movement or activity of a cell or an organism in response to a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (such as [[gas exposure]], [[irradiance|light intensity]] or ambient [[temperature]]).

Unlike taxis, the response to the stimulus provided is non-directional. The animal does not move toward or away from the stimulus but moves at either a slow or fast rate depending on its "[[comfort zone]]." In this case a fast movement (non-random) means that the animal is searching for its comfort zone but a slow movement indicates that it has found it.

==Types==
There are two main types of kineses, both resulting in aggregations. However, the stimulus does not act to attract or repel individuals.

'''Orthokinesis''': in which the speed of movement of the individual is dependent upon the stimulus intensity. For example, the [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] of a woodlice in relation to humidity. With increased humidity there is an increase in the percentage time that the woodlice will remain stationary.

'''Klinokinesis''': in which the frequency or rate of turning is proportional to stimulus intensity. For example the behaviour of the [[flatworm]] (Dendrocoelum lacteum) which turns more frequently in response to increasing light thus ensuring that it spends more time in dark areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1325|title=Result of Your Query|website=www.biological-concepts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic model of kinesis==

The kinesis strategy controlled by the locally and instantly evaluated well-being ([[Fitness landscape|fitness]]) can be described in simple words: Animals stay longer in good conditions and leave quicker bad conditions. If the well-being is measured by the local reproduction coefficient then the minimal [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction-diffusion]] model of kinesis can be written as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Gorban,N. Çabukoǧlu, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322652430_Basic_Model_of_Purposeful_Kinesis Basic model of purposeful kinesis], [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2018.01.002 Ecological Complexity], Volume 33, January 2018, Pages 75-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each population in the biological community,

&lt;math&gt; \partial_t u_ i ( x,t)
   =  D_{0i} \nabla \left(e ^{-\alpha_i r_i(u_1,\ldots,u_k,s)} \nabla u_i \right)+r_i (u_1,\ldots,u_k,s) u_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is the population density of  ''i''th species,
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; represents the abiotic characteristics of the living conditions (can be multidimensional),
&lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the reproduction coefficient, which depends on all &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and on  ''s'',
&lt;math&gt;D_{0i}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[diffusion]] coefficient (defined for equilibrium &lt;math&gt;r_i=0&lt;/math&gt;). The coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;  characterises dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the reproduction coefficient.

The models of kinesis were tested with typical situations. It was demonstrated that kinesis is beneficial for assimilation of both patches and fluctuations of food distribution. Kinesis may delay [[Invasive species|invasion]] and spreading of species with the [[Allee effect]].

{{pp-move-indef}}

"'''Knockout game'''" is one of the names given in the United States by news media and others to assaults in which one person (with others acting as accomplices or lookouts) attempt to "knock out", with a single [[sucker punch]], an unsuspecting victim. The assaults have similarities to the [[happy slapping]] trend seen in Europe, in which [[camera phone]]s are used to record assaults. Other names given to assaults of this type include "'''knockout'''", "'''knockout king'''", "'''point 'em out, knock 'em out'''", and "'''polar-bearing'''" or "'''polar-bear hunting'''" (allegedly called such when the victim is white and the assailants are not).&lt;ref name=nbcpolar/&gt;&lt;ref name=nypostpolar /&gt;&lt;ref name=cbspolar/&gt;

Serious injuries and even deaths have been attributed to the knockout game. Some news sources report that there was an escalation of such attacks in late 2013, and, in some cases, the attacker was charged with a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=nbcpolar/&gt;&lt;ref name="DN CH"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jweek1/&gt; Other media analysts, such as Slate, have cast doubt on the reportedly widespread nature of the game and have labeled the trend, although not the attacks themselves, a [[Urban legend|myth]].&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Roller|first=Emma|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/11/25/why_the_knockout_game_trend_is_a_myth.html|title=Why the 'Knockout Game' trend is a myth|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Melanie|last=Eversley|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/26/knockout-game-myth/3729635|title=Reports: Alleged Trend of 'knockout game' a myth|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November  26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

In September 1992, Norwegian exchange student [[Murder of Yngve Raustein|Yngve Raustein]] was killed by three teenagers who—according to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], prosecutors—were playing a game called "knockout." Local teens said that the object is to render an unsuspecting target unconscious with a single punch, and, if the assailant does not succeed, his companions will turn on him instead.&lt;ref name=yngve&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT student's death attributed to violent "knockout" game|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2pZGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lvgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,4733376&amp;dq=violent+knockout+game&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 11, 2016|newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]|date=1992-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three teens were arrested in [[Decatur, Illinois]], in September 2009, and charged in the killing of a bicyclist, 61, who was stomped to death, and the attempted murder of another man, 46, who was also attacked and stomped. It was claimed that the teens were playing "point 'em out, knock 'em out," where a person is selected and a group of attackers attempts to render the victim unconscious.&lt;ref name=TeensArraigned&gt;{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Ingram|url=http://herald-review.com/news/local/article_88214bad-f545-503b-8d8a-ecfa2b4dae29.html|title=Teens arraigned for Decatur murder|work=[[Herald &amp; Review]]|date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

In 2013, a series of these attacks resulted in the deaths of the victims, all with some sort of game as a precipitating factor.

On November 24, 2013, in [[Katy, Texas]], an 81-year-old African-American man was attacked and hospitalized. Two weeks later, Conrad Alvin Barrett, 29, was arrested after allegedly showing an off-duty police officer a video he recorded with his cell phone of himself perpetrating the attack and explicitly referencing "knockout". Investigators revealed that there were other videos on his phone in which he used racial epithets and another in which he wondered if he would receive media attention if he were to commit a "knockout game" attack on a black man. This was one of the first cases in which the victim was African-American. Previous instances in the US primarily involved white or Asian victims and African-American assailants. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] subsequently charged Barrett with a hate crime, the only time the DOJ involved itself in prosecuting these attacks. Barrett's attorney claimed his client suffers from [[bipolar disorder]] and was not on medication at the time of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/story/news/2014/07/24/12294464|title=Katy Man Charged With Hate Crime For Breaking Jaw Of Elderly Man In 'Knockout Game' Attack|publisher=[[KHOU]]|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9372582|title=Katy Man Charged With Hate Crime For Breaking Jaw Of Elderly Man In 'Knockout Game' Attack|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=2013-12-27|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-man-charged-with-hate-crime-after-knockout-attack|title=Texas Man Charged With Hate Crime After 'Knockout' Attack|publisher=CBS News|date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jocelyn|last1=Lane|first2=Chelsea J.|last2=Carter|date=December 28, 2013|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/27/justice/texas-knockout-charge|title=FBI Agent Quotes Texas Man Bragging About 'Knockout, Baby!'|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/27/22074834-texan-charged-with-hate-crime-for-knockout-game-hit-denied-bail?lite|title=Texan Charged With Hate Crime For 'Knockout Game' Hit Denied Bail|publisher=Usnews.nbcnews.com|date=2013-12-27|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Dinan|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/26/federal-authorities-charge-white-knockout-suspect-|title=Federal Authorities Charge White 'Knockout' Suspect With Hate Crime|work=The Washington Times|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Barrett was sentenced to 71 months (5 years and 11 months) in federal incarceration.

New York City councilman [[Charles Barron]] stated that the root of the problem was a need for jobs to keep young people out of trouble; he also suggested additional funding for community patrols to act as [[lookout]]s.&lt;ref name="lack of job"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/community-leaders-in-east-new-york-blame-lack-of-jobs-for-knockout-game-violence-1.6507548|title=Community leaders in East New York blame lack of jobs for knockout game violence|publisher=Brooklyn.news12.com|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Hakeem Jeffries]] said at a Crown Heights Youth Collective conference that attacks based on race will not be tolerated and that the collective will do everything in its power to see that justice is done.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; Brooklyn's then-[[District Attorney]]-elect [[Kenneth P.

==Criticism of reporting==
{{undue weight|section|date=November 2015}}
The existence of a growing trend of knockout attacks has been questioned; claims about the prevalence of the phenomenon have been called an "urban myth" and a "type of panic" by some political analysts.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

A June 2011 investigative report by John Tucker of the ''[[Riverfront Times]]'' following the death of Hoang Nguyen in 2011 saw many related attacks, all attributed to the "Knockout King" game. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Daniel Isom stated that a year prior the police determined that the knockout game was played by a group of children who went around trying to knock random people unconscious. The police estimated the activity was not widespread and limited to five or nine teens. In Tucker's interviews with local teens, they believed the number to be much higher; one 18-year-old estimated 10-15% of his peers played the game. A St. Louis area barber said that in his youth the phenomenon was not called "Knockout King" but "One Hitter Quitter". [[Mike Males]] of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice claimed that the media has been cherry-picking related attacks for sensationalism, asserting that "This knockout-game legend is a fake trend." Police at the time believed such attacks might have been under-reported by immigrant victims in communities where relations with law enforcement had been tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John H. Tucker|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2011-06-09/news/knockout-king-elex-murphy-hoang-nguyen-dutchtown-murder/full|title=Knockout King: Kids call it a game. Academics call it a bogus trend. Cops call it murder|publisher=Riverfront Times|date=2011-06-09|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack from 2012 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] was tentatively linked to more recent attacks, although it was never identified as part of any "game".&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Police in [[Syracuse, New York]], reported that one assailant in a fatal attack admitted to its being "knockout", with a police sergeant noting that the assaults he was investigating were definitely "for a game" rather than being attempted murders or robberies.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/nyregion/knockout-game-a-spreading-menace-or-a-myth.html?_r=1&amp;|title=Police Unsure if Random Attacks Are Rising Threat or Urban Myth|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2013-11-23|first=Cara|last=Buckley|date=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 23, 2013, ''The New York Times'' reported that police officials in New York City were considering their position on the "game" and were wondering if they should advise the public, but had to contend with the uncertain existence of the game.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Police in New York City questioned whether they were faced with a trend or a series of isolated incidents.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/22/justice/knockout-game-teen-assaults|title=Police keep close eye on reports of disturbing 'knockout' game|publisher=CNN|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-New York Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]] refused to refer to the attacks in Brooklyn as the "knockout game" to avoid possible copycat attacks.&lt;ref name=msnphilly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/crime-justice/knockout-game-a-crime-trend-or-random-violence|title='Knockout game': A crime trend or random violence?|publisher=News.msn.com|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several assaults associated with the knockout game do not follow any particular pattern; in several instances, a single assailant attempted a one-punch attack while in others multiple assailants participated in a gang attack. The "Knockout King" death of Nguyen in St. Louis was such a gang attack. A purported trend was identified in [[Lansing, Michigan]] called "point 'em out, knock 'em out" involved the use of a [[Taser]].&lt;ref name=msnphilly/&gt;

Many officials have outright refused to refer to the assaults as a "game", with Philadelphia Mayor [[Michael Nutter]] explicitly stating he did not want to give the idea any credibility while at a press conference after an attack at a Philadelphia pizzeria where the suspects never mentioned the game.&lt;ref name=msnphilly/&gt; In a [[CNN]] interview with [[Don Lemon]], Nutter stated he was not sure if the knockout game is real or not, adding he less concerned about the name but saying the incidents are of "great concern" and could spark copycat behavior. Nutter would not answer if the attacks were racially motivated and stated that Philadelphia has no confirmed "game" incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simon|last=van Zuylen-Wood|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/12/04/mike-nutter-cnn-dont-know-knockout-game-real|title=Mike Nutter on CNN: I Don't Know If Knockout Game Is Real|publisher=Phillymag.com|date=2013-12-04|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Philadelphia Police spokeswoman Tanya Little determined a November 11 attack as part of a knockout game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-11-24/news/44391897_1_knockout-game-south-philadelphia-assault|title=Police: Recent assault was 'knockout game'|publisher=Articles.philly.com|date=2013-11-24|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamelle Bouie of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' was critical of the game's existence as a trend, comparing its existence to the "wilding" assault allegedly at hand in the [[Central Park jogger case]] and the often reported [[Headlight flashing#Urban legend|headlight flashing urban legend]]. While he did not deny that several people were attacked and one had died, he pointed out that the attacks were not really rare, noting the FBI had reported 127,577 unarmed assaults in 2012.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouie|first=Jamelle|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/25/guess-what-the-knockout-game-is-america-s-latest-phony-panic.html|title=Guess What?

When Singal approached several local news stations, a representative from an [[NBC]] affiliate responded saying that the footage had been taken from a shared pool of stock footage that other NBC stations in the area were given, and generally, if the footage is found to be inaccurate there would be a digital note concerning it. The note was absent in the case of the London video for reasons unknown. Singal's investigation led him to believe that people around the country are being told a story that has not been properly researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singal|first=Jesse|url=http://www.cjr.org/minority_reports/knockout_video_misuse.php?page=all|title='Knockout' reports illustrated with unrelated footage: Columbia Journalism Review|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Hayes (journalist)|Chris Hayes]], host of [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[All In with Chris Hayes]]'', gave the knockout game his first annual "Over-Covered Stories of the Year" award, due to what he perceived as excessive coverage by Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-blames-fox-news-for-2013s-most-over-covered-story|title=Chris Hayes Blames Fox News for 2013′s Most ‘Over-Covered’ Story|publisher=[[Mediaite]]|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin Abcarian for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized this reporting style by a conservative analyst, saying that blame was shifted onto the federal government. Abcarian noted that Barrett explicitly stated he was seeking a black victim, and postulated that he may have been acting on this "lazy narrative that black teens were randomly attacking white people". She criticized the statement by Rev. Sharpton and the conservative news sources who began supporting him after decades of opposition.&lt;ref name=abcariancrazy&gt;{{cite news|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-why-this-version-of-the-knockout-game-makes-conservatives-crazy-20131230,0,5557347,full.story#axzz2pRagcVrZ|title=Why this version of the 'knockout game' makes conservatives crazy|publisher=latimes.com|date=2013-12-30|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tommy Christopher, writing for [[Mediaite]], claimed [[James Rosen (journalist)|James Rosen]]'s report for [[Fox News]] on the attack was misleading, noting claims made by Rosen that it is the first such attack to be charged as a hate crime, when it was the first under federal statute. Christopher cited the arrest of Amrit Marajh in Brooklyn and the investigation of the alleged assault on Taj Patterson, a gay black man who claimed he was attacked by a group of Orthodox Jewish men, as proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-airs-inaccurate-report-on-media-fueled-knockout-game-hate-crime-against-elderly-black-man|title=Fox Airs Misleading Report on 'Knockout Game' Hate Crime Against Elderly Black Man|publisher=Mediaite|date=2013-11-23|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/taj-patterson-gay-black-student-beaten-brooklyn-possible-knockout-game-attack-claims-orthodox-jews|title=Taj Patterson, Gay Black Student Beaten In Brooklyn In Possible Knockout Game Attack, Claims Orthodox Jews Assaulted Him|publisher=Ibtimes.com|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/black-student-hasidic-men-attacked-williamsburg-article-1.1542946|title=Black fashion student says Hasidic men attacked him, shouted anti-gay slurs in Williamsburg|publisher=NY Daily News|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2014-01-04|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abcarian criticized the reporting of this attack as possibly being related to the knockout game trend, as the alleged attackers sought out Patterson because he was gay rather than because he is black. She also brought up a case of a fabrication of a "knockout"-style attack, after the victim and her boyfriend revealed she had lied that she was attacked at random by a stranger and instead he had struck her, noting that the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' did not report the initial attack as a "knockout game" attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byers|first=Christine|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/woman-made-up-knockout-game-story-after-boyfriend-hit-her/article_3d614541-f78d-51e8-95a9-98bcd8507e61.html|title=Woman made up 'knockout game' story after boyfriend hit her, St. Louis police say|publisher=Stltoday.com|date=2013-12-06|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abcarian claimed that the 2011 attack by Dajour Washington on James Addlesburger was being used for sensationalism. The video of the assault was shown by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], which Addlesburger felt was being exploited and manipulated to fan racial hatred. Washington, who spent nine months in juvenile detention for the attack, appeared on ''[[Nightline]]'' in 2013 and claimed he had not attacked Addlesburger because he was white but rather because he was the only man present. Washington also claimed that at the time of the attack he had never heard of the "knockout game".&lt;ref name=abcarianfaux&gt;{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-knockout-game-faux-media-trend-20131211,0,7338857,full.story|title=The 'knockout game' faux media trend has finally jumped the shark|publisher=latimes.com|date=2013-12-12|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' on the "Amendments to the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution of the Republic of Latvia]]"  was held on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/valodas-referendums-notiks-18februari.d?id=42026900|title=Valodas referendums notiks 18.februārī|publisher=Delfi.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed amendments included Articles 4, 18, 21, 101 and 104 of the Constitution of Latvia by adding the condition about [[Russian language|Russian]] as the second official language, as well as prescribing two working languages&amp;nbsp;— Latvian and Russian&amp;nbsp;— for self-government institutions.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum's question was "Do you support the adoption of the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" that provides for the Russian language the status of the second official language?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html |title=Referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" |publisher=Web.cvk.lv |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2000 census, Russian was the [[native language]] of 37.5% and the [[second language]] of 43.7% of the residents. Since 2000, Russian has been regarded as a foreign language according to the Official Language Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=134&amp;id=164 |title=Valsts valodas likums |publisher=Vvk.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2010, the [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] started to collect signatures to force a referendum on whether all publicly financed schools would have to use [[Latvian language|Latvian]] exclusively. By 9 June 2011, they had gathered 120,433 signatures of the minimum 153,232 signatures required, failing to force a referendum.

Protesting against the National Alliance initiative, on 15 February 2011, the youth movement "[[United Latvia]]" ({{lang-ru|Единая Латвия}}), led by Eduard Svatkov, announced the idea of making [[Russian language|Russian]] an official language, alongside Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/153.html |title=Vienota Latvija: Krievu valodai ir jābūt oficiālai valsts valodai |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/16/44711142.html |title=Activitists want Russian to be Latvia"s 2nd state language: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2011, "United Latvia", together with the newly created organisation "Mother Tongue" ({{lang-ru|Родной Язык}}), led by activist [[Vladimir Linderman]] (former leader of the Latvian branch of the Russian [[National Bolshevik Party]]), [[Yevgeny Osipov (politician)|Yevgeny Osipov]] (leader of "Osipov Party"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/70511 |title="Партия Осипова" официально зарегистрирована|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksandr Gaponenko]] (director of the Institute of European Studies, economist), started to collect signatures for a [[initiative|referendum petition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/155.html |title="Vienota Latvija" sāk parakstu vākšanu par krievu valodas nostiprināšanu Satversmē |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/ru/home/155.html |title="Единая Латвия" начинает сбор подписей для закрепления русского языка в Сатверсме |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered 187,378 signatures, forcing a referendum.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/30608/ |title=The voice of the people |publisher=[[The Baltic Times]] |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/presseschau/archiv/article/ARTICLE100367-Don-t-panic-at-Russian-referendum-in-Latvia |title=Don't panic at Russian referendum in Latvia |publisher=eurotopics.net, [[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]] |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kp.ru/daily/25824.4/2800855/ |script-title=ru:Владимир Линдерман, инициатор референдума в Латвии: "Не врите, что русский язык был ввезен в Прибалтику на танках"|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum initiators mentioned possible [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of minority children as the main reason to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.subbota.com/2011/03/09/tn001.html |title=Может ли русский язык быть вторым государственным? |publisher=Old.subbota.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noravank.am/eng/articles/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=5081 |title=Peculiarities of bilingual education from the point of view of the national identity |publisher=Noravank.am |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of this protest action was to slow down the ongoing process of National Alliance signature collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.lv/story/17578.html |title=За русский язык |publisher=Gazeta.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those initiating the referendum to make Russian co-official argued: "In such case there is no other defense method than attack. The initiator of hysteria should be shaken strongly to stop hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.za-rodnoj-jazik.lv/arhiv/manifest/manifest.html |title=За родной язык |publisher=Za-rodnoj-jazik.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held after the [[Saeima]] rejected the draft law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" supported by more than one-tenth of the voters during the Collection of signatures. At least half of the entire electorate has to vote Yes in the referendum in order for it to be valid (771,893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/407778-referendums_notiks_18februari_visi_dodamies_balsot |title=Referendums notiks; 18.februārī visi dodamies balsot|publisher=Tvnet.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholars stated that beside statehood elements, the initiative would have influenced multiple basic human rights and general principles of law protected by the Constitution of Latvia, such as the right to preserve and develop the Latvian language and Latvian ethnic and cultural identity, to participate in the work of the state and of local government, and to hold a position in the civil service; the right to choose one’s employment and workplace freely; the right to education; the rights of a child; and the right to equality and non-discrimination, principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"/&gt;

The referendum organisers did not deny that the main achievement would be to show a large number of Russian language supporters and the final goal would be to change the status of Russian from foreign to some legal (i.e. regional) in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/197269 |title=Линдерман: получение русским официального статуса и в интересах латышей тоже|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official status for Russian was requested due to the fact that the Constitution and Official Language Law do not have any other definitions for language status other than making a language official. Amendments for granting any other status for Russian (i.e. regional) would have had a higher risk of rejection by the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia|Constitutional Court]], thus cancelling the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasha.lv/rus/novosti/news/Interwie/46990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three-quarters of voters voted against Russian as a second national language, with only the eastern region of [[Latgale]] seeing a majority of citizens voting for the change. The referendum had considerably higher voter participation than in previous elections and referendums, with more than 71.1% of registered voters casting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/report-results.html Provisional results of the referendum] Retrieved 2012-02-19. (in Latvian)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
A large part of the Russian speaking community in Latvia (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because, since 1991, they have held [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizen]] status and thus have no right to vote. However, the above numbers also show that non-citizens could not have changed the result of the referendum if they had been allowed to vote. If all 290,660 members of the Russian community had participated and voted in favor of the motion, the proposal would still have been rejected with 59.15% against and 40.60% in favor, with turnout increasing to 75.68% from 71.11%.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Analysis==
Analysts say the turnout, at nearly 70 percent, indicates the strength of feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2012/02/19/latvians-say-no-in-russian-language-vote Latvians say “no” in Russian language vote] www.euronews.net. Retrieved 2012-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum can widen the schism in society and the government will have to undertake serious efforts to consolidate the country's two groups. Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/latvia-russian-language_n_1286544.html?ref=world Latvia Russian Language Referendum Has High Turnout] The Huffington Post.

{{Party politics}}
The '''left–right''' [[political spectrum]] is a system of classifying political positions, [[Ideology|ideologies]] and [[Political party|parties]], from equality on the left to [[social stratification|social hierarchy]] on the right. [[Left-wing politics]] and [[right-wing politics]] are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another; and some stances may overlap and be considered either left- or right-wing depending on the ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=Helen|date=2004|title=Partisanship, Trade Policy, and Globalization: Is There a Left–Right Divide on Trade Policy|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hmilner/forthcoming%20papers/ISQ_milner_judkins2004.PDF|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00293.x|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the terms originated, the Left has been called 'the party of movement' and the Right 'the party of order'.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Garfinkle, Telltale Hearts: The Origins and Impact of the Vietnam Antiwar Movement (1997). Palgrave Macmillan: p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/left Left (adjective)]" and "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/left?show=1&amp;t=1325146819 Left (noun)]" (2011), ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Broad, ''Labour's European Dilemmas: From Bevin to Blair'' (2001). Palgrave Macmillan: p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The intermediate stance is called [[centrism]] and a person with such a position is a [[moderate]] or centrist.

== History of the terms ==
The terms "left" and "right" appeared during the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 when members of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] divided into supporters of the king to the president's right and supporters of the revolution to his left. One deputy, the Baron de Gauville, explained: "We began to recognize each other: those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths, and indecencies that enjoyed free rein in the opposing camp". However, the Right opposed the seating arrangement because they believed that deputies should support private or general interests but should not form factions or political parties. The contemporary press occasionally used the terms "left" and "right" to refer to the opposing sides.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. "Innovators" sat on the left, "moderates" gathered in the centre, while the "conscientious defenders of the constitution" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the [[Ancien Régime]] had previously gathered.{{clarify|date=August 2017|reason=is "conscientious defenders of the constitution" Gauchet's phrase or does it come from a contemporary source?}} When the succeeding [[National Convention]] met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the [[coup d'état]] of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the [[Girondins]] the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would "break up the party groups".&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 245–47&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1814–1815 political clubs were again formed. The majority [[Ultra-royalist|ultraroyalists]] chose to sit on the right. The "constitutionals" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms [[Far-right politics|extreme right]] and [[Far-left politics|extreme left]] as well as [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 247–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "left" and "right" were not used to refer to [[political ideology]] per se, but only to seating in the legislature. After 1848, the main opposing camps were the "[[The Mountain (1849)|democratic socialists]]" and the "[[Reactionary|reactionaries]]" who used red and white flags to identify their party affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 1871, the terms were adopted by political parties: the Republican Left, the Centre Right and the Centre Left (1871) and the Extreme Left (1876) and Radical Left (1881). The beliefs of the group called the Radical Left were actually closer to the Centre Left than the beliefs of those called the Extreme Left.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Crapez, "De quand date le clivage gauche/droite en France?", Revue française de science politique, 48 (1), février 1998, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the early twentieth century, the terms "left" and "right" came to be associated with specific political ideologies and were used to describe citizens' political beliefs, gradually replacing the terms "[[Red flag (politics)|reds]]" and "the reaction". Those on the Left often called themselves "[[Republicanism|republicans]]", while those on the Right often called themselves "[[Conservatism|conservatives]]". The words Left and Right were at first used by their opponents as slurs.

By 1914, the Left half of the legislature in France was composed of Unified Socialists, Republican Socialists and Socialist Radicals, while the parties that were called "Left" now sat on the right side. The use of the words Left and Right spread from France to other countries and came to be applied to a large number of political parties worldwide, which often differed in their political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 255–259.&lt;/ref&gt; There was asymmetry in the use of the terms Left and Right by the opposing sides. The Right mostly denied that the left–right spectrum was meaningful because they saw it as artificial and damaging to unity. However, the Left, seeking to change society, promoted the distinction. As [[Émile Chartier|Alain]] observed in 1931: "When people ask me if the division between parties of the Right and parties of the Left, men of the Right and men of the Left, still makes sense, the first thing that comes to mind is that the person asking the question is certainly not a man of the Left".&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; In British politics, the terms "right" and "left" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955) p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish sociologist [[Robert M. MacIver]] noted in ''The Web of Government'' (1947):  &lt;blockquote&gt;The right is always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes, the left the sector expressive of the lower economic or social classes, and the centre that of the middle classes. Historically this criterion seems acceptable. The conservative right has defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges and powers; the left has attacked them. The right has been more favorable to the aristocratic position, to the hierarchy of birth or of wealth; the left has fought for the equalization of advantage or of opportunity, for the claims of the less advantaged. Defense and attack have met, under democratic conditions, not in the name of class but in the name of principle; but the opposing principles have broadly corresponded to the interests of the different classes.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Ideological groupings across the spectrum ==
Generally, the left-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'ideas such as [[Liberty|freedom]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]], [[rights]], [[Social progress|progress]], [[reform]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]', while the right-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'notions such as [[authority]], [[hierarchy]], [[Law and order (politics)|order]], [[duty]], [[tradition]], [[Reactionary|reaction]] and [[nationalism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KYY-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Key Concepts in Politics and International Relations]'' (2d ed.: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2015), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists and other analysts regard the left as including [[Anarchism|anarchists]],&lt;ref&gt;Clay Risen, "The Bill of the Century", passim, e.g. "Southern Democrats faced three choices: they could ditch their party for the Republicans; move to the left and hope to ride a wave of an expanding post-Jim Crow black electorate; or double down on segregation and white supremacy ..." p. 168, Bloomsbury Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1608198269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. (1994). The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908). Transaction Publishers. p. xi. "Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism ..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communism|communists]], [[socialists]], [[democratic socialists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]],&lt;ref&gt;

Historically, liberals and radicals have been internationalists ... Liberal intellectuals have fought for freedom of movement, freedom from censorship, and world cultural exchange, and have condemned ethnocentrism and prejudice.  Right-wing nationalists, on the other hand, have glorified the unique heritage of their own ethnic group. The right has fought foreign influences that would undermine their historic religion, language, customs, or politics.  But the description of the left as open and internationalist and the right as closed and nationalist is misleadingly simple.  Nationalism has always been the most popularly appealing element in right-wing doctrine. As such it has been seduced and been adopted by the left." *

While this slogan originally served to publicize the Green movement's efforts to find a distinct, third alternative to the growth consensus of capitalism and communism, it has since served to generate a lively and sometimes acrimonious debate within the Green movement concerning the proper political characterization of Green politics .... In particular, ecosocialists have mounted a challenge to the presumed left-right ideology neutrality of Green politics by pointing out the various egalitarian and redistributional (and hence 'leftist') measures that are needed to ensure an equitable transition toward a conserver society."&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have observed that the ideologies of political parties can be mapped along a single left–right axis.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus von Beyme]] categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties. Beyme was able to arrange seven of them from left to right: [[Communism|communist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Green politics|green]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[far-right politics|right-wing extremist]]. The position of agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the late 1980s on two bases, positions on ownership of the means of production and positions on social issues, confirmed this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a tendency for party ideologies to persist and values and views that were present at a party's founding have survived. However, they have also adapted for [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] reasons, making them appear more similar.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[Stein Rokkan]] observed that modern party systems are the product of social conflicts played out in the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; They said that lines of cleavage had become "frozen".&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern [[Political party|political parties]] were liberals, organized by the [[middle class]] in the 19th century to protect them against the [[aristocracy]]. They were major political parties in that century, but declined in the twentieth century as first the [[working class]] came to support socialist parties and economic and [[social change]] eroded their middle class base.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative parties arose in opposition to liberals in order to defend aristocratic privilege, but in order to attract voters they became less doctrinaire than liberals. However, they were unsuccessful in most countries and generally have been able to achieve power only through cooperation with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist parties were organized in order to achieve [[Labor rights|political rights for workers]] and were originally allied with liberals. However, they broke with the liberals when they sought [[Workers' control|worker control]] of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; Christian democratic parties were organized by Catholics who saw liberalism as a threat to traditional values. Although established in the 19th century, they became a major political force following the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Communist parties emerged following a division within socialism first on support of the [[World War I|First World War]] and then support of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing extremist parties are harder to define other than being more right-wing than other parties, but include [[fascism|fascists]] and some extreme conservative and nationalist parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Green parties were the most recent of the major party groups to develop. They have mostly rejected socialism and are very liberal on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

These categories can be applied to many parties outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 44–47&lt;/ref&gt; Ware (1996) asserted that {{clarify |date=August 2017 |reason=needs be more specific than "[[Liberal]]" |text=in the United States both major parties were liberal,}} even though there are left–right policy differences between them.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Western Europe ==
In the 2001 book ''The Government and Politics of France'', Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright say that the main factor dividing the left and right wings in Western Europe is class. The left seeks [[social justice]] through [[Redistribution of wealth|redistributive social and economic policies]], while the Right defends [[private property]] and [[capitalism]]. The nature of the conflict depends on existing social and political cleavages and on the level of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing values include the belief in the power of [[human reason]] to achieve [[Social progress|progress]] for the benefit of the human race, [[secularism]], [[sovereignty]] exercised through the legislature, social justice and mistrust of strong personal political leadership. To the right, this is regularly seen as [[anti-clericalism]], unrealistic [[Reform movement|social reform]], doctrinaire [[socialism]] and [[class hatred]]. The Right are skeptical about the capacity for radical reforms to achieve human well-being while maintaining workplace competition. They believe in the established church both in itself and as an instrument of social cohesion; and believe in the need for strong political leadership to minimize social and political divisions. To the Left, this is seen as a selfish and reactionary opposition to social justice, a wish to impose doctrinaire religion on the population and a tendency to [[authoritarianism]] and [[Oppression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, ''Beyond Left and Right, the Future of Radical Politics'', "In many continental European countries, for example, 'conservatism' suggests the political influence of Catholicism." p. 22.  "American conservatism, in some of its major forms at least, has almost from its beginnings been aggressively procapitalist in ways that its European counterparts have not." p. 23.  "(However) the basic dilemmas now faced by conservative and socialist thought are everywhere similar." p. 23.  "Conservatism, it is often said, opposes rationalism." p. 24., Stanford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-2451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between left and right have altered over time. The initial cleavage at the time of the [[French Revolution]] was between supporters of [[absolute monarchy]] (the Right) and those who wished to limit the king's authority (the Left). During the 19th century, the cleavage was between [[Monarchism|monarchists]] and [[Republicanism|republicans]]. Following the establishment of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 1871, the cleavage was between supporters of a strong [[Executive (government)|executive]] on the Right and supporters of the primacy of the [[legislature]] on the Left.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage in the United States ==
The terms left-wing and right-wing are widely used in the United States, but as on the global level there is no firm consensus about their meaning. The only aspect that is generally agreed upon is that they are the defining opposites of the United States [[political spectrum]]. Left and right in the U.S. are generally associated with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] respectively, although the meanings of the two sets of terms do not entirely coincide. Depending on the political affiliation of the individual using them, these terms can be spoken with varying implications. A 2005 poll of 2,209 American adults showed that "respondents generally viewed the paired concepts liberals and left-wingers and conservatives and right-wingers as possessing, respectively, generally similar political beliefs", but also showed that around ten percent fewer respondents understood the terms left and right than understood the terms liberal and conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21354/ Right Wing, Left Wing, Chicken Wing | MediaCulture | AlterNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[American Left|left in the United States]] is usually understood as a category that includes [[Modern American liberalism|New Deal social-liberals]] (in contrast to traditions of [[social democracy]] more common to Western Europe), [[John Rawls|Rawlsian liberals]] and [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]], who are often identified with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. There are also leftists who reject many of the platforms of the Democratic Party in favor of more socialist policies. In general, the term left-wing is understood to imply a commitment to [[egalitarianism]], support for [[Social policy|social policies]] that appeal to the [[working class]] and [[multiculturalism]]. The contemporary center-left usually defines itself as promoting government [[regulation]] of [[business]], [[commerce]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[industry]]; protection of [[fundamental rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]] ([[separation of church and state]])&lt;nowiki/&gt;; and government intervention on behalf of racial, ethnic and sexual [[minorities]] and the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, "American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation", Knopf, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26628-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance of the terms today ==
Some political scientists have suggested that the classifications of "left" and "right" are no longer meaningful in the modern complex world. Although these terms continue to be used, they advocate a more complex spectrum that attempts to combine political, economic and social dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Ruypers, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted between 1983 and 1994 by [[Bob Altemeyer]] of Canadian legislative caucuses showed an 82% correlation between party affiliation and score on a scale for [[right-wing authoritarianism]] when comparing right-wing and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] caucuses. There was a wide gap between the scores of the two groups, which was filled by liberal caucuses. His survey of American legislative caucuses showed scores by American Republicans and Democrats were similar to the Canadian Right and liberals, with a 44% correlation between party affiliation and score.&lt;ref&gt;''The authoritarian specter'', Bob Altemeyer (1996), pp. 258–98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norberto Bobbio]] saw the polarization of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s as evidence that the linear left–right axis remained valid. Bobbio thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the Left or Right were weak. The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences. He saw the Left and Right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time. In his view, the left–right axis could be applied to any time period.&lt;ref&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'' (1996) Norberto Bobbio, Allan Cameron, pp. vi–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] writer [[David Boaz]] argued that terms left and right are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the "left" typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class; and those on the "right" usually emphasizing their support for [[individualism]] and accusing the Left of supporting [[collectivism]]. Boaz asserts that arguments about the way the words should be used often displaces arguments about policy by raising emotional prejudice against a preconceived notion of what the terms mean.&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''The Politics of Freedom: Taking on The Left, the Right, and Threats to our Liberties'', Cato Institute, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-933995-14-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] described the main cleavage in politics as not left versus right, but [[Open–closed politics|open versus closed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business|title=Tony Blair’s unfinished business|first=Jason|last=Cowley|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, attitudes towards social issues and globalism are more important than the conventional economic left–right issues: "open" voters tend to be [[social liberalism|socially liberal]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] and in favour of [[globalism]], while "closed" voters are [[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]], [[opposition to immigration|opposed to immigration]] and in favour of [[protectionism]]. This model has seen increased support following the rise of [[Populism|populist]] and [[Centrism|centrist]] parties in the 2010s.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and|title=Drawbridges up|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21718921-identity-does-not-have-be-exclusive-preserve-far-right-dutch-election-suggests|title=The Dutch election suggests a new kind of identity politics|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyrical abstraction''' is either of two related but distinct [[art movement|trends]] in [[Post-war]] [[Modernist]] painting:

''European Abstraction Lyrique'' born in Paris, the French art critic [[Jean José Marchand]] being credited with coining its name in 1947, considered as a component of ([[Tachisme]]) when the name of this movement was coined in 1951 by Pierre Guéguen and Charles Estienne the author of ''L'Art à Paris 1945–1966'', and ''American Lyrical Abstraction'' a movement described by [[Larry Aldrich]] (the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut) in 1969. &lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"&gt;Aldrich, Larry.

Hess on Larry Aldrich, Retrieved June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A third definition is the usage as a descriptive term. It is a descriptive term characterizing a type of abstract painting related to Abstract Expressionism; in use since the 1940s. Many well known abstract expressionist painters like [[Arshile Gorky]] seen in context have been characterized as doing a type of painting described as lyrical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/exhibitions/3426 Kemper Museum] Retrieved June 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/bellam63.htm interview with Richard Bellamy, 1963, Archives of American Art, retrieved February 1st, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The original common use refers to the tendency attributed to paintings in Europe during the post-1945 period and as a way of describing several artists (mostly in France) with painters like [[Wols]], [[Gérard Schneider]] and [[Hans Hartung]] from Germany or [[Georges Mathieu]], etc., whose works related to characteristics of contemporary American abstract expressionism. At the time (late 1940s), [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]] and numerous other American artists were, as well, living and working in Paris and other European cities. With the exception of Kelly, all of those artists developed their versions of painterly abstraction that has been characterized at times as lyrical abstraction, [[tachisme]], [[color field]], [[Nuagisme]] and [[abstract expressionism]].

The [[art movement]] ''Abstraction lyrique'' was born in [[Paris]] after the war. At that time, the artistic life in Paris, which had been devastated by the [[military occupation|Occupation]] and [[Collaboration]], resumed with numerous artists exhibited again as soon as the Liberation of Paris in mid-1944. According to the new abstraction forms that characterised some artists, the movement was named by the [[art critic]], Jean José Marchand, and the painter, Georges Mathieu, in 1947. Some art critics also looked at this movement as an attempt to restore the image of artistic Paris, which had held the rank of capital of the arts until the war.  Lyrical abstraction also represented a competition between the [[School of Paris]] and the new [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of [[Abstract Expressionism]] painting represented above all since 1946 by [[Jackson Pollock]], then [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Mark Rothko]], which were also promoted by the American authorities from the early 1950s.

Lyrical abstraction was opposed not only to the [[Cubist]] and [[Surrealist]] movements that preceded it, but also to [[geometric abstraction]] (or "cold abstraction"). Lyrical abstraction was, in some ways, the first to apply the lessons of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], considered one of the fathers of abstraction. For the artists, lyrical abstraction represented an opening to personal expression.

Finally, in the late 1960s (partially as a response to [[minimal art]], and the dogmatic interpretations by some to [[Clement Greenberg|Greenbergian]] and [[Donald Judd|Juddian]] [[Formalism (art)|formalism]]), many painters re-introduced painterly options into their works and the Whitney Museum and several other museums and institutions at the time formally named and identified the movement and uncompromising return to painterly abstraction as 'lyrical abstraction'.

Just after [[World War II]], many artists old and young were back in Paris where they worked and exhibited: [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[André Lanskoy]] and Zaks from Russia; [[Hans Hartung]] and [[Wols]] from Germany; [[Árpád Szenes]], [[Endre Rozsda]] and [[Simon Hantaï]] from Hungary; [[Alexandre Istrati]] from Romania; [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] from Canada; [[Vieira da Silva]] from Portugal; [[Gérard Ernest Schneider]] from Switzerland; Feito from Spain; [[Bram van Velde]] from the Netherlands; [[Albert Bitran]] from Turkey; [[Zao Wou-Ki]] from China; Sugai from Japan; [[Sam Francis]], John Franklin Koenig, Jack Youngerman and [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]] from the U.S.A.

All these artists and many others were at that time among the "Lyrical Abstractionists" with the French: [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Pierre Soulages]], Nallard, [[Jean René Bazaine]], Jacques Doucet, Camille Bryen, [[Jean Le Moal]], [[Gustave Singier]], [[Alfred Manessier]], [[Roger Bissière]], [[Pierre Tal-Coat]], [[Jean Messagier]] and others.

Lyrical Abstraction was opposed not only to "l’Ecole de Paris" remains of pre-war style but to [[Cubist]] and [[Surrealist]] movements that had preceded it, and also to [[geometric abstraction]] (or "Cold Abstraction"). For the artists in France, Lyrical Abstraction represented an opening to personal expression. In [[Belgium]], [[Louis Van Lint]] figured a remarkable example of an artist who, after a short period of geometric abstraction, has moved to a lyrical abstraction in which he excelled.

Many exhibitions were held in Paris for example in the galleries Arnaud, Drouin, Jeanne Bucher, Louis Carré, Galerie de France, and every year at the "Salon des Réalités Nouvelles" and "Salon de Mai" where the paintings of all these artists could be seen. At the Drouin gallery one could see Jean Le Moal, [[Gustave Singier]], [[Alfred Manessier]], Roger Bissière, [[Wols]] and others. A wind blew over the capital when [[Georges Mathieu]] decided to hold two exhibitions: ''L'Imaginaire'' in 1947 at the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] which he would have prefer to call ''abstraction lyrique'' to impose the name and then ''HWPSMTB'' with ([[Hans Hartung]], [[Wols]], [[Francis Picabia]], François Stahly sculptor, Georges Mathieu, [[Michel Tapié]] and Camille Bryen) in 1948.
 
In March 1951 was held the larger exhibition ''Véhémences confrontées'' in the gallery Nina Dausset where for the first time were presented side to side French and American abstract artists. It was organised by the critic [[Michel Tapié]], whose role in the defense of this movement was of the highest importance. With these events, he déclared that « the lyrical abstraction is born ».

It was, however, a fairly short reign (late 1957), which was quickly supplanted by the [[New Realism]] of [[Pierre Restany]] and [[Yves Klein]].

Starting around 1970, this movement has been revived by a new generation of artists born during or immediately after the Second World War. Some of its key promoters include Paul Kallos, Georges Romathier, Michelle Desterac, and [[Thibaut de Reimpré]].

An exhibition entitled "The Lyrical Flight, Paris 1945–1956" (''L'Envolée Lyrique, Paris 1945–1956''), bringing together the works of 60 painters, was presented in Paris at the Musée du Luxembourg from April to August 2006 and included the most prominent painters of the movement: [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Gérard Ernest Schneider|Gérard Schneider]], [[Zao Wou-Ki]], [[Albert Bitran]], [[Serge Poliakoff]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lyrical Flight, Paris 1945–1956, texts Patrick-Gilles Persin, Michel and Pierre Descargues Ragon, Musée du Luxembourg, Paris and Skira, Milan, 2006, 280 p. {{ISBN|88-7624-679-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Lyrical Abstraction''' is an [[art movement]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction: Color and Mood,'' [[Sheldon Museum of Art]], exhibition review "New Exhibit goes big, bold" ''[[Lincoln Journal-Star]]'', Sunday, May 30th, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, DC]], and then [[Toronto]] and [[London]] during the 1960s–1970s.  Characterized by intuitive and loose paint handling, spontaneous expression, illusionist space, acrylic staining, process, occasional imagery, and other painterly and newer technological techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Dore. Young Abstract Painters: Right On! Arts v. 44, n. 4, February, 1970, pp. 31–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction led the way away from [[minimalism]] in painting and toward a new freer [[expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, ''Art News'', v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Painters who directly reacted against the predominating [[Formalism (art)|Formalist]], [[Minimalist]], and [[Pop Art]] and [[geometric abstraction]] styles of the 1960s, turned to new, experimental, loose, painterly, expressive, pictorial and abstract painting styles.  Many of them had been Minimalists, working with various monochromatic, geometric styles, and whose paintings publicly evolved into new abstract painterly motifs. American Lyrical Abstraction is related in spirit to [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color Field painting]] and [[Europe]]an [[Tachisme]] of the 1940s and 1950s as well. [[Tachisme]] refers to the French style of abstract painting current in the 1945–1960 period. Very close to [[Art Informel]], it presents the European equivalent to [[Abstract Expressionism]].

The [[Sheldon Museum of Art]] held an exhibition from 1 June until 29 August 1993 entitled ''Lyrical Abstraction: Color and Mood''. Some of the participants included [[Dan Christensen]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cleve Gray]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Robert Natkin]], William Pettet, [[Mark Rothko]], Lawrence Stafford, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and several other painters. At the time the museum issued a statement the read in part:

"As a movement, Lyrical Abstraction extended the post-war [[Modernist]] aesthetic and provided a new dimension within the abstract tradition which was clearly indebted to [[Jackson Pollock]]'s "dripped painting" and [[Mark Rothko]]'s stained, color forms. This movement was born out of a desire to create a direct physical and sensory experience of painting through their monumentality and emphasis on color – forcing the viewer to "read" paintings literally as things."&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Lincoln, Sheldon Museum of Art, May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2009 the [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]] in Florida hosted an exhibition entitled ''Expanding Boundaries: Lyrical Abstraction Selections from the Permanent Collection''

At the time the museum issued a statement that said in part:

"Lyrical Abstraction arose in the 1960s and 70s, following the challenge of Minimalism and Conceptual art. Many artists began moving away from geometric, hard-edge, and minimal styles, toward more lyrical, sensuous, romantic abstractions worked in a loose gestural style. These "lyrical abstractionists" sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting, and to revive and reinvigorate a painterly 'tradition' in American art. At the same time, these artists sought to reinstate the primacy of line and color as formal elements in works composed according to aesthetic principles – rather than as the visual representation of sociopolitical realities or philosophical theories."

"Characterized by intuitive and loose paint handling, spontaneous expression, illusionist space, acrylic staining, process, occasional imagery, and other painterly techniques, the abstract works included in this exhibition sing with rich fluid color and quiet energy. Works by the following artists associated with Lyrical Abstraction will be included: [[Natvar Bhavsar]], [[Stanley Boxer]], Lamar Briggs, [[Dan Christensen]], [[David Diao]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Sam Francis]], Dorothy Gillespie, [[Cleve Gray]], [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Pat Lipsky]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Robert Natkin]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Larry Poons]], Garry Rich, [[John Seery]], Jeff Way and [[Larry Zox]]." &lt;ref name="bocamuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.bocamuseum.org/index.php?category=Exhibitions&amp;link=ExhibitionArchive&amp;src=gendocs ''Expanding Boundaries: Lyrical Abstraction: Selections from the Permanent Collection''], [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]], retrieved June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term in America===
Lyrical Abstraction, an exhibition in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], May 25–July 6, 1971 was described by John I. H. Baur, curator of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971, "Foreword by John I. H. Baur"&lt;/ref&gt;

:"To be given an entire exhibition surveying a current trend in American art at a single blow is an experience unusual to the verge of the bizarre…Mr. Aldrich defines the trend of Lyrical Abstraction and explains how he came to acquire the works…"

Lyrical Abstraction was the title of a circulating exhibition which commenced at the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]], [[Connecticut]] from April 5 through June 7, 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316858273&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, May 25 through July 6, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a term that was used by Larry Aldrich (the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut) in 1969 to describe what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitewallmag.com/2010/05/11/john-seery-new-work/ Interview with John Seery 2010, ''Whitewall Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Aldrich, a successful designer and art collector, defined the trend of Lyrical Abstraction and explained how he came to acquire the works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316858273&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970. ‘’Statement of the exhibition"&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Statement of the Exhibition" he wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Early last season, it became apparent that in painting there was a movement away from the geometric, hard-edge, and minimal, toward more lyrical, sensuous, romantic abstractions in colors which were softer and more vibrant…The artist's touch is always visible in this type of painting, even when the paintings are done with spray guns, sponges or other objects...As I researched this lyrical trend, I found many young artists whose paintings appealed to me so much that I was impelled to acquire many of them. The majority of the paintings in the ''Lyrical Abstraction'' exhibition were created in 1969 and all are a part of my collection now."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Larry Aldrich donated the paintings from the exhibition to the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction], exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971, "Foreword by John I. H. Baur"&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term Lyrical Abstraction was a pejorative, which unfortunately adversely affected those artists whose works were associated with that name. In 1989 [[Union College]] art history professor, the late [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] observed that Lyrical Abstraction was the term used in the late sixties to describe the return to painterly expressivity by painters all over the country and "consequently", Robbins said, "the term should be used today because it has historical credibility"&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Daniel.

==Relation to other tendencies==
[[File:Spiked Red.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pat Lipsky]], ''Spiked Red,'' 1970. Her work was included in the Lyrical Abstraction exhibition at the Whitney Museum in 1970 and at the Boca Raton Museum in 2009.]]
Lyrical Abstraction along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;   sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of [[Fluxus]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color Field]] [[Painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal Art]], [[Op art]], [[Pop Art]], [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general. Characterized by an overall gestalt, consistent surface tension, sometimes even the hiding of brushstrokes, and an overt avoidance of relational composition. It developed as did [[Postminimalism]] as an alternative to strict [[Formalism (art)|Formalist]] and [[Minimalist]] doctrine. 

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with [[Color Field]] [[Painting]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface, an example is illustrated by the painting by [[Ronnie Landfield]] entitled ''For William Blake''. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Color Field]] [[Painting]]. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Action Painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[Action Painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. The differences with [[Color Field]] [[Painting]] are more subtle today because many of the Color Field painters like [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Sam Francis]], and [[Jack Bush]] &lt;ref name="jbush"&gt;"[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/canadian/Jack-Bush.html Jack Bush]". The Art History Archive; Canadian Art. Retrieved December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[Morris Louis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Paul Feeley, Thomas Downing, and [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] evolved into Lyrical Abstractionists. Lyrical Abstraction shares with both [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Color Field]] Painting a sense of spontaneous and immediate sensual expression, consequently distinctions between specific artists and their styles become blurred, and seemingly interchangeable as they evolve.

By the mid-1950s, Richard Diebenkorn abandoned [[abstract expressionism]] and along with [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]] and several others formed the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] with a return to Figurative painting. During the period between the fall 1964 and the spring of 1965 Diebenkorn traveled throughout Europe, he was granted a cultural visa to visit and view Henri Matisse paintings in important Soviet museums. He traveled to the then Soviet Union to study [[Henri Matisse]] paintings in Russian museums that were rarely seen outside of Russia. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965 his resulting works summed up all that he had learned from his more than a decade as a leading figurative painter.&lt;ref name="Jane56"&gt;Livingston, Jane.

In ''The Art of Richard Diebenkorn'', [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. 56. {{ISBN|0-520-21257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1967 he returned to abstraction his works were parallel to movements like the [[Color Field]] movement and Lyrical Abstraction.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/obituaries/richard-diebenkorn-lyrical-painter-dies-at-71.html ''NY Times'' obituary ''Richard Diebenkorn Lyrical Painter Dies at 71'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, English painter [[John Hoyland]]'s [[Color field]] paintings were characterised by simple rectangular shapes, high-key color and a flat picture surface. In the 1970s his paintings became more textured.&lt;ref name=stives/&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, he showed his paintings in [[New York City]] with the Robert Elkon Gallery and the [[André Emmerich]] Gallery. His paintings were closely aligned with [[Post-Painterly Abstraction]], Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction.&lt;ref name="sbma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web|title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960-1979|year=2010|publisher=Santa Barbara Museum of Art|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstract Expressionism]] preceded [[Color Field painting]], Lyrical Abstraction, [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], and the other movements of the 1960s and 1970s and it influenced the later movements that evolved. The interrelationship of/and between distinct but related styles resulted in influence that worked both ways between artists young and old, and vice versa. During the mid-1960s in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere artists often crossed the lines between definitions  and art styles. During that period – the mid-1960s through the 1970s advanced American art and contemporary art in general was at a crossroad, shattering in several directions. During the 1970s political movements and revolutionary changes in communication made these American styles international; as the art world itself became more and more international. American Lyrical Abstraction's [[Europe]]an counterpart [[Neo-expressionism]] came to dominate the 1980s, and also developed as a response to American [[Pop Art]] and [[Minimalism]] and borrows heavily from American [[Abstract Expressionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22900">In [[agriculture]], '''Managed intensive rotational grazing''' ('''MIRG'''), also known as simply as managed grazing or cell grazing, mob grazing and [[Holistic management|holistic managed planned grazing]], describes a variety of closely related systems of forage use in which [[ruminant]] and non-ruminant herds and/or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh rested areas with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of [[forage]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Undersander|first1=Dan|title=Pastures for Profit, a guide to rotational grazing|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1097378.pdf|website=USDA-NRCS|publisher=University of Minnesota extension service|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One primary goal of MIRG is to have a vegetative cover over all grazed areas at all times, and to prevent the complete removal of all vegetation from the grazed areas ("bare dirt")&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrilifenews.tamu.edu/showstory.php?id=1786 Healing native rangeland may require a combination of burning and rotational grazing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/SmallAcreageBrochure.pdf Small Acreage Grazing impacts to our natural resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630100728/http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/SmallAcreageBrochure.pdf |date=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/rotational-grazing-zm0z15amzcom.aspx Rotational grazing for Pastured Livestock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1167363.pdf Managing Your Pasture: Small scale solutions for your farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks and other animals. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover.  The length of time a paddock is grazed will depend on the size of the herd and the size of the [[Field (agriculture)|paddock]] and local environmental factors.  Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves, rebuild shoot systems, and deepen root systems, with the result being long-term maximum [[biomass]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Alice E. Beetz and Lee Rinehart  2004.  [http://watershedbmps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/01772_rotgraze.pdf Rotational grazing].  National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service  (ATTRA).&lt;/ref&gt;  MIRG is especially effective because grazers do better on the more tender younger plant stems. MIRG also leave parasites behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers.  Pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements, and with the increased productivity of MIRG systems, the grazers obtain the majority of their nutritional needs without the supplemental feed sources that are required in continuous grazing systems.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"&gt;Undersander, D., Albert, B., Cosgrove, D., Johnson, D., Peterson, P.

One key element of this style of animal husbandry is that either each grazed area must contain all elements needed for the animals (water source, for instance) or the feed or water source must be moved each time the animals are moved.  Having fixed feeding or watering stations defeats the rotational aspect, leading to degradation of the ground around the water supply or feed supply if additional feed is provided to the animals.  Special care must be taken to ensure that high use areas do not become areas where mud, parasites or diseases are spread or communicated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/grazing-systems/grazing-systems-handbook.pdf Grazing systems planning guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1097378.pdf Pastures for profit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herd health and welfare==

===Animal health risks===
[[Ruminal tympany]], also known as bloat, is a common problem in [[grazing systems]] for [[ruminants]], although not for pigs or poultry, that if left untreated can lead to animal death.  This problem occurs when foam producing compounds in plants are digested by cows, causing foam to form in the rumen of the animal and ultimately prohibiting animals from expelling gas.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, K., DeClue, R., Emmick, D.  2000. [http://grazingguide.net/documents/cow-feeding-mgt.pdf Prescribed grazing and feeding management for lactating dairy cows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123133549/http://grazingguide.net/documents/cow-feeding-mgt.pdf |date=2015-11-23 }}  USDA-NRCS&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of bloat can be mitigated by seeding non-bloating [[legume]]s with the grasses.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005&gt;2005. [https://store.extension.iastate.edu/ItemDetail.aspx?ProductID=5256 Pasture management guide for Livestock Producers]. Iowa State University (note, no electronic source available)&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are especially susceptible to bloat if they are moved to new pasture sources when they are particularly hungry.   It is therefore important to ensure that the herd is eating enough at the end of a rotation when forage will be more scarce, limiting the potential for animals to gorge themselves when turned onto new paddocks.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

Several problems are related to shade in pasture areas.  Although shade provides relief from heat and reduces the risk of heat stress, animals tend to congregate in these areas which leads to nutrient loading, uneven grazing, and potential soil erosion.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;  Taller shade trees move the shade area around as the day progresses minimizing this problem.

===Animal health benefits and animal welfare===
Herd health benefits arise from animals having access to both space and fresh air.  Freedom of movement within a paddock results in increased [[physical fitness]], which limits the potential for injuries and [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasion]], and reduces the potential of exposure to high levels of harmful disease-causing [[microorganism]]s and insects.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

In a concentrated animal feeding operation ([[CAFO]]), it is considered normal for a large number of animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of manure and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as [[foot rot]] due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of [[antibiotic]]s to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to [[antibiotic resistance]] for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.

By comparison, with managed grazing, the animals are able to spread out and exist in a natural environment more suited for their natural growth and development. As the animals move to a new paddock, wastes are left behind and allowed to decay without the animals nearby. The animals experience less disease without the need for regular antibiotic dosing, and fewer foot ailments.

==Weed control==
In general, a well managed rotational grazing system has rather low pasture weed establishment because the majority of niches are already filled with established forage species, making it hard for competing weeds to emerge and become established.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt; The use of multiple species in the co-grazing helps to minimize weeds. Established forage plants in rotational grazing pasture systems are healthy and unstressed due to the "rest" period, enhancing the [[competitive advantage]] of the forage.  Additionally, in comparison to cash grain crop production, many plants which would be considered weeds are not problematic in perennial pasture.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;  Many of these plants are actually nutritious to grazers and control of these plants is therefore not necessary in management intensive rotational systems.  However, certain species such as [[thistles]] and various other weeds, are indigestible and possibly poisonous to grazers.  These plant species will not be grazed by the herd and can be recognized for their prevalence in pasture systems.

A key step in managing weeds in any pasture system is identification.  Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management can be implemented to control weed populations.  It is important to recognize that no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;  Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures.  Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant.  These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production.  Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on [[herbicides]], weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary.  Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used.  Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

==Nutrient availability and soil fertility==
If pasture systems are seeded with more than 40% legumes, commercial nitrogen [[fertilization]] is unnecessary for adequate plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, J., Grant, R., Olesen, J.E., Kristensen, I.S., Vinther, F.P, Molgaard, J.P., and Petersen, B.M.  2006.  Nitrogen cycling in organic farming systems with rotational grass-clover and arable crops.  Soil Use and Management, 22: 197-208.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Legumes are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus providing nitrogen for themselves and surrounding plants. 
Although grazers remove nutrient sources from the pasture system when they feed on forage sources, the majority of the nutrients consumed by the herd are returned to the pasture system through manure.  At a relatively high [[stocking rate]], or high ratio of animals per [[hectare]], manure will be evenly distributed across the pasture system.  The nutrient content in these manure sources should be adequate to meet plant requirements, making commercial fertilization unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;   Management intensive rotational grazing systems are often associated with increased [[soil fertility]] which arises because manure is a rich source of [[organic matter]] that increases the health of soil.  In addition, these pasture system are less susceptible to [[erosion]] because the land base has continuous ground cover throughout the year.

High levels of fertilizers entering waterways are a pertinent environmental concern associated with agricultural systems.  However, management intensive rotational grazing systems effectively reduce the amount of nutrients that move off-farm which have the potential to cause environmental degradation.&lt;ref name="Blanchet, K. 2003"&gt;Blanchet, K., Moechnig, H., and DeJong-Hughes, J.  2003.  [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/components/DI7606.pdf Grazing systems planning guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618055354/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/components/DI7606.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}.  USDA-NRCS and University of Minnesota Extension and University of Minnesota Water Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt;  These systems are fertilized with on-farm sources, and are less prone to leaching as compared to commercial fertilizers.  Additionally, the system is less prone to excess nutrient fertilization, so the majority of nutrients put into the system by manure sources are utilized for plant growth.&lt;ref name="Blanchet, K. 2003"/&gt;  Permanent pasture systems also have deeper, well established forage root systems which are more efficient at taking up nutrients from within the soil profile.&lt;ref name=IowaGuide2005/&gt;

==Socio-cultural-economic considerations==
Although milk yields are often lower in MIRG systems, net farm income per cow is often greater as compared to confinement operations.  This is due to the additional costs associated with  herd health and purchased feeds are greatly reduced in management intensive rotational grazing systems.  Additionally, a transition to management intensive rotational grazing is associated with low start-up and maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"/&gt; Another consideration is that while production per cow is less, the number of cows per acre on the pasture can increase. The net effect is more productivity per acre at less cost.

The main costs associated with transitioning to management intensive rotational grazing are purchasing fencing, fencers, and water supply materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cadwallader, T. and Cosgrove, D.  [http://www.uwex.edu/ces/crops/uwforage/settpost.pdf Setting Posts: Fencing systems for rotational grazing].  University of Wisconsin Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2005.  Electric fencing for serious grazers.  USDA-NRCS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watering systems for grazing livestock.  Great Lakes Basin Grazing Network and Michigan State University Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a pasture was continuously grazed in the past, likely capital has already been invested in fencing and a fencer system.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"&gt;Kriegl, T., McNair, R. 2005. [http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/pastplenty607.pdf Pastures of Plenty: Financial performance of Wisconsin grazing dairy farms]. Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems, Center for Dairy Profitability, and Program on Agricultural Technology Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  Cost savings to [[Pastoral farming|grazier]]s can also be recognized when one considers that many of the costs associated with livestock operations are transmitted to the grazers.  For example, the grazers actively harvest their own sources of food for the portion of the year where grazing is possible.  This translates into lower costs for feed production and harvesting, which are fuel intensive endeavors.  MIRG systems rely on the grazers to produce fertilizer sources via their excretion.  There is also no need for collection, storage, transportation, and application of manure, which are also all fuel intensive.  Additionally, external fertilizer use contributes to other costs such as labor, purchasing costs.&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

It can also be demonstrated that management intensive rotational grazing system also result in time savings because the majority of work which might otherwise require human labor is transmitted to the herd.&lt;ref name="Kriegl, T. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Undersander, D. 2002"/&gt;

==Environmental considerations==
Many pastures undergoing MIRG are less susceptible to soil erosion and are associated with higher soil fertility than continuously grazed pastures, depending on the skill of the manager and the management system they are using.  As a result, the paddocks require fewer commercial inputs, which have been associated with negative environmental impacts.  In addition, because these systems tend to be more resilient and stable they are more capable of responding to changing environmental conditions and perturbations while not compromising productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Steve, Fred E.

==Human nutrition==

== Criticism ==
Managed intensive rotational grazing paints a wide brush over many different managed grazing systems. Managers have found that rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briske|first=D. D.|title=Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/person/1354/75.%20REM-D-10-00084.1.pdf|work=Rangeland Ecol Manage 64:325–334|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management.  The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent on the effectiveness of those management models. Depending on the management model, plant production has been shown to be equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Briske, J. D.

{{Administrative law}}
The '''doctrine of nondelegation''' is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] or [[wikt:implicit|implicit]] in all written [[constitution]]s that impose a strict structural [[separation of powers]]. It is usually applied in questions of constitutionally improper delegations of powers of any of the three branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities. Although it is usually constitutional for executive officials to delegate executive powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.

==Australia==

[[Federalism in Australia|Australian federalism]] does not permit the federal Parliament or Government to delegate its powers to state or territorial parliaments or governments, nor territorial parliaments or governments to delegate their powers to the federal Parliament or Government, but the states parliaments delegate its powers to the federal parliament by means of section 51 subsection (xxxvii) of the Constitution Act 1901.

==Canada==

[[Canadian federalism]] does not permit Parliament or the provincial legislatures to delegate their powers to each other.

==United States==

In the [[Federal Government of the United States]], the ''nondelegation doctrine'' is the principle that the [[Congress of the United States]], being vested with "all legislative powers" by [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 1 of the [[United States Constitution]], cannot delegate that power to anyone else.  However, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an [[Implied powers|implied power]] of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an "[[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]] principle" to guide the executive branch: "'In determining what Congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination.' So long as Congress 'shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.'"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'' (1989), citing ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406, 48 S.Ct. 348, 351(1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is an agency in the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]] created by Congress with the power to regulate [[food]] and [[approved drug|drugs]] in the United States. Congress has given the FDA a broad mandate to ensure the safety of the public and prevent [[false advertising]], but it is up to the agency to assess risks and announce prohibitions on harmful additives, and to determine the process by which actions will be brought based on the same. Similarly, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has been given the responsibility of collecting taxes that are assessed under the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Although Congress has determined the amount of the tax to be assessed, it has delegated to the IRS the authority to determine how such taxes are to be collected. [[Independent agencies of the United States government|Administrative agencies]] like these are sometimes referred to as the [[Fourth Branch]] of government.

===Case law===
The origins of the nondelegation doctrine, as interpreted in U.S., can be traced back to, at least, 1690, when [[John Locke]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Legislative  transfer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated Power from the People, they, who have it, cannot pass it over to others. . . . And when the people have said, We will submit to rules, and be govern'd by Laws made by such Men, and in such Forms, no Body else can say other Men shall make Laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any Laws but such as are Enacted by those, whom they have Chosen, and Authorised to make Laws for them. The power of the Legislative being derived from the People by a positive voluntary Grant and Institution, can be no other, than what the positive Grant conveyed, which being only to make Laws, and not to make Legislators, the Legislative can have no power to transfer their Authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise of Civil Government]] (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of nondelegation was ''Wayman v. Southard'' (1825).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=23&amp;invol=1 FindLaw.com ''Wayman v. Southard'' decision tesxt]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe [[Due process|judicial procedure]]; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details." In 1892, the Court in ''Field v. Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, noted "That congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution"&lt;ref name="field"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&amp;court=us&amp;vol=143&amp;invol=649 FindLaw.com ''Field v. Clark'' decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; while holding that the tariff-setting authority delegated in the [[McKinley Tariff|McKinley Act]] "was not the making of law," but rather empowered the executive branch to serve as a "mere agent" of Congress.&lt;ref name="field"/&gt;

During the 1930s, Congress provided the executive branch with wide powers to combat the [[Great Depression]]. The Supreme Court case of ''[[Panama Refining v. Ryan]]'', [[Case citation|293 U.S. 388]] (1935) involved the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], which included a provision granting the [[President of the United States|President]] the authority to prohibit the interstate shipment of [[petroleum]] in excess of certain quotas. In the ''Panama Refining'' case, however, the Court struck down the provision on the ground that Congress had set "no criterion to govern the President's course."

Other provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act were also challenged. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'' (1935), the Supreme Court considered a provision which permitted the President to approve trade codes, drafted by the businesses themselves, so as to ensure "fair competition." The Supreme Court found that, since the law sets no explicit guidelines, businesses "may roam at will and the President may approve or disapprove their proposal as he may see fit." Thus, they struck down the relevant provisions of the Recovery Act.

In the 1989 case ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/631/eemeid/materials/Mistretta.htm ''Mistretta v. United States decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; the Court stated that:

{{quote|Applying this "intelligible principle" test to congressional delegations, our jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives. Accordingly, this Court has deemed it "constitutionally sufficient" if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.}}

Only rarely has the Supreme Court invalidated laws as violations of the nondelegation doctrine. Exemplifying the Court's legal reasoning on this matter, it ruled in the 1998 case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' that the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]], which authorized the President to selectively void portions of [[appropriation bill]]s, was a violation of the [[Presentment Clause]], which sets forth the formalities governing the passage of legislation. Although the Court noted that the attorneys prosecuting the case had extensively discussed the nondelegation doctrine, the Court declined to consider that question. However, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], in a [[concurring opinion]], wrote that he would have found the statute to violate the exclusive responsibility for laws to be made by Congress.

===Original Sixteenth Amendment===

The original [[United_States_Bill_of_Rights|Bill of Rights]] approved by the House of Representatives included a Sixteenth Article, which stated that "(t)he powers delegated by the Constitution to the government of the United States, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the powers vested in the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive the powers vested in the Legislative or Judicial; nor the Judicial the powers vested in the Legislative or Executive." This article was not included in subsequent versions of the Articles or in the final Amendments.

The '''''One-Roll Engine''''' (or '''''O.R.E.''''') is a [[generic role-playing game system]] developed  by [[Greg Stolze]] for the [[alternate history]] [[superhero]] roleplaying game ''[[Godlike (role-playing game)|Godlike]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolze|first=Greg|title=One-Time-Things|url=http://gregstolze.com/onetime.html|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was expanded upon in the modern-day sequel, ''[[Wild Talents (role-playing game)|Wild Talents]],'' as well as the [[heroic fantasy]] game ''Reign'' and the free horror game ''Nemesis.'' A simpler version was used for ''[[Monsters and Other Childish Things]]''. The One-Roll Engine is notable for its unique dice rolling system in which matched values on [[ten-sided dice]] (d10s) determine all variables of a check in a single roll. This eliminates, for example, the separate initiative, hit location and damage rolls common during combat in other systems.

==Mechanics==
The One-Roll Engine uses a '''[[dice pool]]''' of d10s equal to the character's '''[[attribute (role-playing games)|Stat]]''' and '''[[Skill (role-playing games)|Skill]]''' similar to that used by [[Storyteller system]]. Since the dice are always d10s, a pool is written as the number of dice followed by a "d"; for example, a pool of six dice would be written "6d".

While most dice pool systems count the number of dice which roll above a certain number to determine success, the O.R.E. system instead depends on matching dice, such as a pair of dice showing 8 or three dice showing 2. Matching dice are called a "set"; the number of matching dice in a set is called the "Width", while the face up number on the dice is the set's "Height". Shorthand notation for writing results is Width x Height, so a pair of 8s would be written 2x8 and three 2s would be written 3x2.

A roll may have more than one set; the player can usually choose which one to use. If there are no matches, then the player may select a single die to act as a set with a Width of 1. In general, a set's Width determines the speed of an action, while the Height determines how successful the action was. In combat, Width and Height also determine the damage and hit location.

Powers, such as those possessed by superhuman Talents in ''Godlike'', are modeled with special dice. "Hard Dice" are considered to always have a value of 10, while "Wiggle Dice" have a value assigned by the player ''after'' the rest of the pool is rolled. The shorthand notation for Hard Dice is ''hd'' and Wiggle Dice is ''wd'', so a Dice pool of six regular dice, two Hard Dice and one Wiggle Die would be noted 6d+2hd+1wd.

Nemesis introduces "Expert Dice", which may be used as normal dice, or the player can select their value ''before'' the roll, but no two Expert Dice can be selected to have the same value. Expert Dice are also used as buffer against die penalties, where each Expert Die counteracts one die penalty, but then must be rolled as a normal die. NEMESIS also uses Wiggle Dice, but renames them "Trump Dice". The shorthand notation for Expert Dice is ''ed'' and Trump Dice is ''td''.

Reign also uses "Wiggle Dice", but uses the name "Master Dice" (shorthand notation "md"). In this setting any dice pool just could contain one special die ("md" or "ed") and can never roll more than ten dice at once. (Excess allows offsetting penalties while still resulting in an effective pool of ten.)

The simplified O.R.E. used in ''Monsters and Other Childish Things'' only uses special dice for monsters. Normal dice in a monsters' pools may be sacrificed during character creation for special qualities, one of which, "Awesome", grants a die that works like an Expert die in ''Nemesis''. Taking the Awesome quality a second time makes the die function like a Wiggle Die. ''Monsters'' does not use Hard Dice, but other special qualities modify rolls in specific, more limited ways. For example, "Gnarly" adds one to damage in combat rolls, while "Wicked Fast" adds one to Width for the purposes of determining speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">In the '''platonia dilemma''' introduced in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=Dilemmas for Superrational Thinkers, Leading Up to a Luring Lottery |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=248 |number=6 |date=June 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=737–755 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an eccentric trillionaire gathers 20 people together, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him a telegram (reverse charges) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the [[superrationality|superrational]] thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.

==Luring Lottery==
A similar game, referred to as a "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of ''[[Scientific American]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |year= |title=Irrationality Is the Square Root of All Evil |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=249 |number=3 |date=September 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=756–766 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number "1" written on it.  They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit.  The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry.  Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize.  It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others.  Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.

According to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated [[dice|die]] with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send "1" if you roll "1".  If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a "1", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard.  Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.

Although the magazine had previously discussed the concept of [[superrationality]] from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a [[googolplex]]).  Some took this game further by filling their postcards with mathematical expressions designed to evaluate to the largest possible number in the limited space allowed.  The magazine was unable to tell who won, and the monetary value of the prize would have been a minuscule fraction of a cent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19957">'''Postbiological evolution''' is a form of [[evolution (term)|evolution]] which has transitioned from a [[life|biological paradigm]], driven by the propagation of genes, to a nonbiological (e.g., [[cultural evolution|cultural]] or [[technological evolution|technological]]) paradigm, presumably driven by some alternative replicator (e.g., [[memetics|memes]] or [[Teme (philosophy)|temes]]), and potentially resulting in the extinction, obsolescence, or [[trophic level|trophic reorganization]] of the former. Researchers anticipating a postbiological universe tend to describe this transition as marked by the [[Technological maturity|maturation]] and potential convergence of [[high technology|high technologies]], such as [[artificial intelligence]] or [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;The Biological Universe: The Twentieth Century Extraterrestrial Life Debate and the Limits of Science, Dr Steven Dick (Cambridge University Press, 1996). ASIN B000UUKKY6 {{ISBN|9780521663618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind Children: the Future of Robot and Human Intelligence, Moravec, H. (1988 Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution from biological to mechanical==
&lt;!--Either rename/restructure this section or make it less human-centric--&gt;

===Cultural evolution===
The dictionary definition of Evolution is any process of formation, growth or development. In [[biological evolution]] the main principle behind this development is survival, we evolved to become stronger and quicker, we also evolved to become intelligent. But as we became intelligent biological evolution subsided to a new concept, [[cultural evolution]]. Cultural evolution moves at a much faster rate than biological evolution and this is one reason why it isn't very well understood. But as survival is still the main driving force behind life and that intelligence and knowledge is currently the most important factor for that survival, we can reasonably assume that cultural evolution will progress in the direction of furthering intelligence and knowledge.

===Intelligence Principle===
Cultural evolution progressing in this way and being based upon the furthering of intelligence is known as the [[Intelligence Principle]]; this was suggested by Dr Steven J Dick.

"The maintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central driving force of cultural evolution, and that to the extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved" (Dick 1996)

If cultural evolution progresses in this direction then due to cultural evolution being much faster than biological, the limiting factor becomes our biology and the capability of our brains. Currently the closest and so most probable solution to this problem is [[artificial intelligence]], (AI). Experts in AI even believe it holds the potential and capability for a postbiological earth in the next several generations, (Moravec 1988, 1999). AI could be utilised to solve scientific problems and to analyse situations much faster and more accurately than our own minds.

===Transition to purely postbiological===
The move to a complete postbiological stage has two different routes. One route is the change of human consciousness from a biological vessel into a mechanical; this would require the digitisation of human consciousness. A mechanical based vessel would increase the computational power and intelligence of the human consciousness exponentially, and also eliminate the weakness of a biological form. This route is therefore a logical progression through cultural evolution with survival and the pursuit of knowledge and intelligence at its centre.

The first route requires a high level of technology, therefore would take a long time, this results in another possible road to a completely postbiological civilisation (PBC). The other route is the complete replacement of human consciousness by AI, for this the human race would co-exist peacefully with our own creation of AI which is scientific, objective, and free from selfish human nature. 

The future of the human race through cultural evolution is not known and the possible postbiological outcomes are infinite, so to address what we could evolve into is almost futile. But [[Hans Moravec]] predicted that;

"What awaits us is not oblivion but rather a future which, from our present vantage point, is best described as 'postbiological' or even 'supernatural'. It is a world swept away by the tide of cultural change, usurped by its own artificial progeny"

==Evolution of a postbiological universe==
The possible forms a PBC may take are as diverse as in biological evolution, if not more. But from our knowledge of technology and with the intelligence principle being the main driving force we may make some predictions.

===Limitations on a postbiological civilization===

====Heat dispersion====
The current major limitations imposed upon computation are limited storage space, processing power, dust gathering chips, inefficiency of their human operators and heat dispersion. The only one that is fundamental and fixed is heat dispersion because this is due to the laws of physics. In computation the greater the amount of information to be calculated, (I) the greater the energy needed (E), but the energy needed is also proportional to another factor, the temperature, (T).

E=KIT

Where K is a constant. Therefore, the greater the temperature the greater the energy needed, and so the greater the inefficiency is also. If we now apply the Intelligence principle to this then a PBC would move to decrease the temperature and so increase the efficiency and computational power.
In the universe the greatest source of heat transfer is via [[radiation]], therefore a PBC would look to migrate to an area of low radiation and so low temperature. If we now observe the galaxy we see that the most radiation is generated by the [[galactic centre]] by both the high stellar density and also highly energetic events such as [[supernova]]. Therefore, the coldest regions are away from the galactic centre or inside [[giant molecular cloud]]s. Giant molecular clouds although being very low in temperature (T~10K) are areas of giant star formation and so the temperature in one location is irregular, which would make it unsuitable for a PBC.

====Metals====
Another factor affecting a PBC would be the abundance of metals and heavier elements needed for expansion and repair. The highest concentration of these elements is found near the galactic centre, where they are created by massive stars. But to a PBC with advanced technology the production of metals via [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in stars is highly inefficient, converting only a small amount of hydrogen to heavier nuclei and the high loss of energy that is produced in the [[nuclear fusion]]. Therefore, a PBC would most likely have the capability to produce heavier nuclei through controlled fusion and minimise the energy lost.

===Galactic technological zone===
By taking the two factors of heat dispersion and heavy nuclei into account we can find a "galactic technological zone" (GTZ), similar to the principle of a "[[galactic habitable zone]]" (GHZ) for biological life. Where temperatures are low enough to maximise computing efficiency but there is also matter available for fusion, this most likely lies on the outskirts of the [[galaxy]].

===Migration theory===
A migration hypothesis exists that takes the GTZ into account. A PBC would most likely not think on a similar time scale to us, therefore although a migration to GTZ may seem inefficient and lengthy to us, a PBC could consider this on timescales of 10^6 years, where the increased computing efficiency received far outweighs the energy required in transportation. The idea of interstellar migrations already exists in literature, (e.g. [http://www.astronomytoday.com/exploration/solartravel.html Badescu and Cathcart 2000]).

==Implications of postbiological civilization in astrobiology==

===Assumptions needed for a postbiological civilization===
In the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) the main focus is on biological life. But the timescale of intelligent biological life could be very short; already some experts believe that we could see a postbiological earth in the next few generations. According to [[Steven J. Dick]], for a PBC to arise other than our own and be present, we must make five assumptions:

#That evolution by natural selection results in intelligence beyond the earth;
#That extraterrestrial intelligence is older than human intelligence;
#That intelligence results in culture;
#That culture evolves; and
#That increasing intelligence is a central goal of cultural evolution.

===Timescale over which a postbiological civilization can form===
We know that assumptions 1, 3, 4, and 5 can take place as we have observed or are observing them on the Earth. For assumption 2 we must consider the L term of the [[Drake equation]], and the timescale over which intelligent biological life can form. Around 1 Billion years after the start of the [[universe]] the first sun-like star had formed, and there were enough heavy elements around for planet formation ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000JRASC..94..198D|Delsemme 1998], [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.astro.42.053102.134034 Larson and Bromm 2001]). From the earth we know that intelligent life can form within 5 billion years, this puts a lower time scale on which intelligent life can form, 6 billion years. And from the current rate of technological progression the leap from intelligent life to a PBC is negligible compared to the astronomical timescale. This means we could already be looking at a postbiological universe. In our own galaxy the first sun-like stars formed at around 4 billion years therefore we could already have a PBC in our galaxy that formed 3-4 billion years ago.

===Implications for the search for life===
If we consider this possibility of a PBC in our galaxy we are still faced with [[Fermi paradox|Fermi's paradox]]. However many of the proposed solutions for Fermi's paradox also hold true for a PBC. In terms of the search for extraterrestrial life and [[astrobiology]] because of the almost infinite possible forms a PBC could take and our lack of understanding of these we would effectively be blind in this search. For this reason even though there is a logical argument for the existence of PBCs our best hopes remain with looking for biological life.

While in some circles the expression "postbiological evolution" is roughly synonymous with [[human genetic engineering]],&lt;ref name="Agar 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author= Agar, Nicholas|author-link= Nicholas Agar|title= Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement|date= 2004|isbn= 1-4051-2390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parens 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Parens, Erik |title= Enhancing Human Traits: Ethical and Social Implications |publisher= [[Georgetown University Press]] |date= 2000 |isbn= 0-87840-780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is used most often to refer to the general application of the [[technological convergence|convergence]] of [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]], and [[cognitive science]] (NBIC) to [[performance improvement|improve human performance]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Roco, Mihail C. |editor2= Bainbridge, William Sims |editor2-link= William Sims Bainbridge |title= [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]] |publisher= Springer |date= 2004 |isbn= 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, several academics (such as some of the fellows of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]&lt;ref name="Bailey 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bailey, Ronald |author-link= Ronald Bailey |title= The Right to Human Enhancement: And also uplifting animals and the rapture of the nerds |date= 2006 |url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/116489.html |accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have risen to become cogent advocates of the case for human enhancement while other academics (such as the members of [[The President's Council on Bioethics|President Bush's Council on Bioethics]]&lt;ref name="Members of the President's Council on Bioethics 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author= Members of the President's Council on Bioethics |title= Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness |url= http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/ |publisher= [[President's Council on Bioethics]] |date= 2003 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070202061234/http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/ |archivedate= 2007-02-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have become its most outspoken critics.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004 (book)"&gt;{{cite book |author= Hughes, James |title= [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future |publisher= [[Westview Press]] |date= 2004 |isbn= 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocacy of the case for human enhancement is increasingly becoming synonymous with "[[transhumanism]]", a controversial ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens to either maintain or [[body modification|modify]] their own [[cognitive liberty|mind]]s and [[morphological freedom|bodies]]; so as to guarantee them the [[choice|freedom of choice]] and [[informed consent]] of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children.&lt;ref Name="Ford 2005"&gt;{{cite web |last= Ford |first= Alyssa |authorlink=  |title= Humanity: The Remix |work= [[Utne Magazine]] |publisher=  |date= May–June 2005 |url= http://www.twliterary.com/jhughes_utne.html |accessdate= 2007-03-03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061230170920/http://www.twliterary.com/jhughes_utne.html |archivedate= 2006-12-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuromarketing]] consultant Zack Lynch argues that [[neurotechnologies]] will have a more immediate effect on society than [[gene therapy]] and will face less resistance as a pathway of radical human enhancement. He also argues that the concept of "[[enablement (disambiguation)|enablement]]" needs to be added to the debate over "therapy" versus "enhancement".&lt;ref name="R. U. Sirius 2005"&gt;{{cite news |author= R. U. Sirius |author-link= R. U. Sirius |title= The NeuroAge: Zack Lynch In Conversation With R.U.

Although many proposals of human enhancement rely on [[fringe science]], the very notion and prospect of human enhancement has sparked public [[controversy]].&lt;ref name="The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[The Royal Society]] &amp; The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] |title= Nanoscience and nanotechnologies (Ch. 6) |date= 2004 |url= http://www.nanotec.org.uk/report/chapter6.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author= European Parliament |author-link= European Parliament |title= Technology Assessment on Converging Technologies |date= 2006 |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/publications/studies/stoa183_en.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author= European Parliament |author-link= European Parliament |title= Human Enhancement |date= 2009 |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/publications/studies/stoa2007-13_en.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics argue that "human enhancement" is a [[loaded language|loaded term]] which has [[eugenic]] overtones because it may imply the improvement of human [[hereditary]] traits to attain a universally accepted [[norm (social)|norm]] of [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] (at the possible expense of human [[biodiversity]] and [[neurodiversity]]), and therefore can evoke negative reactions far beyond the specific meaning of the term. Furthermore, they conclude that enhancements which are self-evidently good, like "fewer diseases", are more the exception than the norm and even these may involve ethical tradeoffs, as the [[controversy about ADHD]] arguably demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Carrico, Dale |author-link= Dale Carrico |title= Modification, Consent, and Prosthetic Self-Determination |date= 2007 |url= http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20070226/ |accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most common criticism of human enhancement is that it is or will often be practiced with a [[recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] and [[selfishness|selfish]] short-term perspective that is ignorant of the long-term consequences on individuals and the rest of society, such as the fear that some enhancements will create unfair physical or mental advantages to those who can and will use them, or unequal access to such enhancements can and will further the gulf between the "haves" and "have-nots".&lt;ref name="Ian 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mooney, Pat Roy |author-link= Pat Roy Mooney |title= Beyond Cloning: Making Well People "Better" |date= 2002 |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/521 |accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2002"&gt;{{cite book |author= Fukuyama, Francis |author-link= Francis Fukuyama |title= [[Our Posthuman Future]]: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution |publisher= Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux |date= 2002 |isbn= 0-374-23643-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBHF"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future |author-link= Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future |title= Human "Enhancement" |url= http://www.thehumanfuture.org/themes/human_enhancement/background.html |accessdate= 2007-02-02 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070209224106/http://www.thehumanfuture.org/themes/human_enhancement/background.html |archivedate= 2007-02-09 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, some advocates, who want to use more neutral language, and advance the [[public interest]] in so-called "human enhancement technologies", prefer the term "enablement" over "enhancement";&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101129174400/http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/projects/human_enhancement/pdfs/HESummaryReport.pdf Good, Better, Best: The Human Quest for Enhancement], Enita A.

'''Project Neptune'''  is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of £2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-csd.eng.cam.ac.uk/themes0/water-1/project-neptune-delivering-sustainable-water-systems-by-optimising-existing-infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service involves the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the [[University of Cambridge]] is heading the work on integrating [[artificial intelligence]] and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.

== Research priority areas ==
In order to address the technological deficiencies of the project, research priority areas (RPA) have been identified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The RPA three key concentrations include “data and knowledge management, pressure management (including energy management), and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic D. A.|last2=Boxall J. B.|last3=Ulanicki B.|last4=Kapelan Z.|last5=Makropoulos C.|last6=Fenner R.|last7=Soga K.|last8=Marshall I. W.|last9=Maksimovic C.|title=Project Neptune: Improved Operation of Water Distribution Networks|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41024(340)47|journal=Water Distribution Systems Analysis 2008|series=Proceedings|doi=10.1061/41024(340)47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of the RPA are focused on developing communication networks, sustainable technologies, real time information feedback system, and optimal operations. The function of the communication network is to evaluate the performance and reliability of already implemented hardware and sensors for collecting faraway data. In order to achieve a reduction in energy usage, sustainable technologies that develop innovative energy harvesting technology and reduce the necessity for constant battery replacement are necessary for the project. Real time information relates to acquiring knowledge related to performance of the water distribution system. Optimal operations can be achieved through improvement in understanding and analyzing relevant data, which includes online models of hydraulics. The first round of RPA work is contributing to the initiative headed by Yorkshire Water Services to install the first prototypes of Ground Penetrating Radar Systems (GPRS). The Yorkshire initiative aims to install around 490 prototypes that are connected to sensors that collect pressure and flow data on a half hourly basis.

== Development goals ==
Project Neptune’s academic and industrial partners aim to address the tasks of developing: energy saving options, online simulation model to provide an overlook of a full day’s water distribution patterns, system to mitigate and manage leakage, automate system adjustments, power harvesting methods, and optimized system for reacting to incidents.

Staff involved in the system controls department of the project have the burden of handling large amounts of data received. The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed in order to alleviate this burden and aid the staff in decision making, prioritizing urgent incidents, and identifying faulty alarms. The DSS functions to combine these strategy and decision making outputs into one single and comprehensive presentation of data for the operator.

== Partners and funding ==
The project today receives funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in order to further advance understanding and contribute knowledge about optimal and efficient water supply systems. Industrial funding is also provided for the project, the main contributors include the United Utilities and Yorkshire Water Services. University of Exeter in the UK carries out research for the project in collaboration with seven other research universities located in the UK, including University of Cambridge, the University of Sheffield, Imperial College London, De Montfort University, Lancaster University, University of Leicester, and University of Sheffield.

'''Rainbow/PUSH''' is a non-profit organization formed as a merger of two [[non-profit]] organizations founded by [[Jesse Jackson]] — '''Operation PUSH''' (People United to Save Humanity) and the '''National Rainbow Coalition'''. The organizations pursue [[social justice]], [[civil rights]] and political [[activism]].

In December 1971, Jackson resigned from [[Operation Breadbasket]] after clashing with Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]] and founded '''Operation PUSH'''.  Jackson founded the '''National Rainbow Coalition''' in 1984 which merged with PUSH in 1996. The combined organization keeps its national [[headquarters]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] and  has branches in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], the [[Silicon Valley]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and [[Boston]].

Operation PUSH was successful at raising public awareness to initiate [[corporate action]] and government sponsorship.  The National Rainbow coalition became a prominent political organization that raised public awareness on numerous political issues and consolidated a large voting block.  The merged entity has undertaken numerous social initiatives.

Operation PUSH, an [[acronym]] for People United to Save (later Serve) Humanity, was an organization which advocated black [[self-help]] and achieved a broad audience for its [[Modern American liberalism|liberal]] stances on issues of social justice and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-907911/National-Rainbow-Coalition|accessdate=September 5, 2007|title=National Rainbow Coalition (American organization)|work=Encyclopædia Britannica online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Operation PUSH can be traced to a factional split in Operation Breadbasket, an affiliate of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].&lt;ref name=EOCPUSH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/934.html|accessdate=September 5, 2007|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|author=Ralph, James|title=Operation PUSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the head of the SCLC, appointed Jackson to head the Chicago chapter of Operation Breadbasket, which became a coalition of black ministers and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=JPO /&gt;

After 1968, Jackson increasingly clashed with King's successor at SCLC, Rev. Ralph Abernathy. The break became complete in December 1971 when Abernathy suspended Jackson for "administrative improprieties and repeated acts of violation of organizational policy." Jackson resigned from Operation Breadbasket, called together his allies, and Operation PUSH was born.

From its inception, Jackson referred to its membership as a "Rainbow Coalition."&lt;ref name=JPO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879017,00.html|title=Jackson PUSHes On|accessdate=May 1, 2008|date=January 3, 1972|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Rainbow Coalition" was originated in 1968 by Chicago Black Panther leader [[Fred Hampton]] to describe the [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|multi-ethnic revolutionary federation]] he founded.  Jackson was not part of the Hampton Rainbow Coalition, and had a difficult relationship with the Panthers.  Some former members of Hampton's coalition are resentful of Jackson appropriating the name, partly because Jackson's politics are [[reformist]], and partly because Jackson [[copyrighted]] the name, preventing others from using it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w48RL7fwRroC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=hampton,+rainbow,+jesse+jackson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=71SEiv-z_O&amp;sig=SZbVAvhS2FC6FF0C9ZnJQH_92qc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ndO2VP-XFezIsQTLwYGYDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hampton%2C%20rainbow%2C%20jesse%20jackson&amp;f=false Jakobi Williams, From the Bullet to the Ballot: The Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party and Racial Coalition Politics in Chicago, (University of North Carolina Press, 2013), pp. 198–204]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although money was a problem at first, initial backing came from [[Manhattan Borough President]] [[Percy Sutton]], [[Gary, Indiana]] Mayor [[Richard Hatcher]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Jim Brown]], and [[Ossie Davis]].&lt;ref name=JPO /&gt;

[[File:THE REV. JESSE JACKSON SPEAKS ON A RADIO BROADCAST FROM THE HEADQUARTERS OF OPERATION PUSH AT ITS ANNUAL CONVENTION.... - NARA - 556253.jpg|thumb|[[Jesse Jackson]] speaks at 1973 PUSH National Convention]]
The organizational meeting of PUSH was in the Chicago home of Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]], a prominent black doctor and community leader on the [[South side (Chicago)|South Side]].  Before he moved to Chicago in 1956, Howard had developed a national reputation as a [[Mississippi]] civil rights leader, [[surgeon]], and [[entrepreneur]].  Howard served on PUSH's board of directors and chaired the finance committee.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through PUSH Jackson was able to continue pursuit of the same economic objectives that Operation Breadbasket had pursued.  In addition, his new organization was able to expand into areas of social and political development for blacks in Chicago and across the nation. The 1970s saw various tactics to pursue the organization's objectives including direct action campaigns, weekly radio broadcasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

and awards through which Jackson protected black homeowners, workers, and businesses, and honored prominent blacks in the US and abroad.

He also started a push campaign against the legalization of abortion after the Roe vs Wade decision in 1973.

== National Rainbow Coalition ==
[[File:Jesse Jackson, half-length portrait of Jackson seated at a table, July 1, 1983 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesse Jackson]] was a Presidential candidate in both [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] and [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]].]]
The National Rainbow Coalition (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a political organization that grew out of Jesse Jackson's [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential campaign]]. During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a "Rainbow Coalition", an idea created by [[Fred Hampton]], regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds.&lt;ref name=ME /&gt; The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, [[voting rights]], and [[affirmative action]] for all groups that had been neglected by [[Reaganomics]].&lt;ref name=GCL /&gt;

Jackson's campaign blamed President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the Black and other minority populations particularly hard.&lt;ref name=ME /&gt;

At the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] on July 18, 1984, in [[San Francisco, California]], Jackson delivered an address entitled "The Rainbow Coalition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jessejackson1984dnc.htm|accessdate=September 5, 2007|publisher=American Rhetoric|year=2007|title=Top 100 Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The speech called for [[Arab American]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Asian American]]s, youth, [[disabled]] [[veteran]]s, small [[Agriculture in the United States|farmers]], [[lesbian]]s and [[gay]]s to join with [[African American]]s and [[Jewish American]]s for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address [[political empowerment]] and [[public policy]] issues.&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=2076&amp;cat=Magazine&amp;more=/magazine/|title=Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Reaches Hispanics|accessdate=September 7, 2007|date=November 2, 2000|publisher=Hispanic Business Inc.|work=HispanicBusiness.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015931/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=2076&amp;cat=Magazine&amp;more=%2Fmagazine%2F|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that "were hurt by Reagan administration policies" - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.&lt;ref name=ME /&gt;

== 1990s onwards ==
Jackson moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] to serve as [[shadow senator]] from 1991 to 1996.  When he returned to Chicago in 1996 he merged his organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/jesse/chronology.html|title=The Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=WGBH educational foundation|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The merged entity advocates for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, other minorities, and women. Its main economic goal is to have more minorities on the payrolls, in the boardrooms, and on the supplier lists of major corporations.  The industries it most aggressively pursues are the [[Financial market|financial sector]] on [[Wall Street]], the telecommunications field and [[high-tech]] firms in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=HB /&gt;

The Wall Street activities are organized under sub-organization "The Wall Street Project".&lt;ref name=GCL /&gt; The organization has been active in pursuit of increase minority representation in other industries, most notably the broadcast media, the entertainment industry, and the automobile industry. It has also sought increased representation by minority administrators in college and professional sports under the leadership of [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DE133DF93AA15755C0A965958260|title= Sports people: pro basketball; Survey Shows Lack of Jobs for Blacks|accessdate=May 1, 2008|date=June 29, 1993|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hispanic issues the merged entity works closely with the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] and the [[National Council of La Raza]].&lt;ref name=HB /&gt;

In 1998 the organization attacked [[Freddie Mac]] for its lending and employment practices, which led to its pledge to earmark $1 billion in mortgage loans specifically for minorities, to donate more than $1 million directly to Rainbow/PUSH and to become a sponsor of Jackson's annual Wall Street Project. In 2000, the organization investigated the case of Raynard Johnson, who was found hanged by a belt from a tree in front of his home in [[Kokomo, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=GCL /&gt; Jackson labelled it a "lynching", although two autopsies both concluded that the death was a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0007/21/bp.00.html Burden of Proof: Hanging Death Mystery in Mississippi: Suicide or Murder?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829171723/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0007/21/bp.00.html |date=August 29, 2008 }}, CNN transcript, July 21, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s (decade), Rainbow/PUSH worked with [[NASCAR]] to increase the number of minorities involved in [[auto racing]], through direct financial support and projects to find talented African-American racing drivers.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/rpm/2002/0212/1330805.html NASCAR is trying to change its image], Rupen Fofaria, [[ESPN.com]], February 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was ended in 2003, after the racing sanctioning body was criticized by conservative groups for the partnership.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2003-07-28-jackson-support_x.htm NASCAR ends donations to Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH], Chris Jenkins, [[USA Today]], July 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Among the smaller campaigns it has undertaken are the HIV/AIDS Initiative for funding for [[AIDS]] programs; the National Field Department support of "constructive agitation to bring about societal change"; and the Prison Outpost project, whose ultimate goal is "to eliminate the need for prisons."

Through his organization and its predecessors Jackson has advocated [[universal health care]], a war on drugs, direct peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, ending [[apartheid]] in South Africa and advancing democracy in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalleadersevents.com/event-speakers/jesse-jackson.cfm|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Global Leaders|title=Jesse Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is the organization's list of major issues:

* 1% Student Loans
* Jobs and Economic Empowerment
* Employee Rights and Livable Wages
* Educational Access
* Fair and Decent Housing
* Voter Registration and Civic Education
* Election Law Reform
* Fairness in the Media, Sports, and Criminal Justice System
* Political Empowerment
* Trade and Foreign Policy
* Affirmative Action and Equal Rights
* Gender Equality
* Environmental Justice

Former congressman [[Mel Reynolds]], who served a sentence in prison for sexual assault and bank fraud, was hired by Rainbow/PUSH as its resident scholar on prison reform after his release in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB424C00812E63B&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Reynolds finds work with S.

In 2006, Jesse Jackson promised the Rainbow/Push Coalition would pay the college tuition for [[Crystal Mangum]].  Mangum made  rape allegations against members of Duke University's men's lacrosse team who had hired her as a stripper. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence.

Within [[computer science]] and [[operations research]],
many [[combinatorial optimization]] problems are computationally [[intractability (complexity)|intractable]] to solve exactly (to optimality).
Many such problems do admit fast ([[polynomial time]]) [[approximation algorithms]]—that is, algorithms that are guaranteed to return an approximately optimal solution given any input.

'''Randomized rounding'''
{{harv|Raghavan|Tompson|1987}}
is a widely used approach for designing and analyzing such [[approximation algorithms]].&lt;ref name="MotwaniRaghavan1995"&gt;

The basic idea is to use the [[probabilistic method]]
to convert an optimal solution of a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]]
of the problem into an approximately optimal solution to the original problem.

== Overview ==
The basic approach has three steps:
# Formulate the problem to be solved as an [[integer linear program]] (ILP).
# Compute an optimal fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the [[linear programming relaxation]] (LP) of the ILP.
# Round the fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP to an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the ILP.

(Although the approach is most commonly applied with linear programs,
other kinds of relaxations are sometimes used.
For example, see Goeman's and Williamson's [[semi-definite programming]]-based
[[Semi-definite_programming#Example_3_.28Goemans-Williamson_MAX_CUT_approximation_algorithm.29|Max-Cut approximation algorithm]].)

The challenge in the first step is to choose a suitable integer linear program.
Familiarity with linear programming is required, in particular, familiarity with
how to model problems using linear programs and integer linear programs.
But, for many problems, there is a natural integer linear program that works well,
such as in the Set Cover example below.  (The integer linear program should have a small
[[Linear_programming_relaxation#Approximation_and_integrality_gap|integrality gap]];
indeed randomized rounding is often used to prove bounds on integrality gaps.)

In the second step, the optimal fractional solution can typically  be computed
in [[Polynomial_time#Polynomial_time|polynomial time]]
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.

In the third step, the fractional solution must be converted into an integer solution
(and thus a solution to the original problem).
This is called ''rounding'' the fractional solution.
The resulting integer solution should (provably) have cost
not much larger than the cost of the fractional solution.
This will ensure that the cost of the integer solution
is not much larger than the cost of the optimal integer solution.

The main technique used to do the third step (rounding) is to use randomization,
and then to use probabilistic arguments to bound the increase in cost due to the rounding
(following the [[probabilistic method]] from combinatorics).
There, probabilistic arguments are used to show the existence of discrete structures with
desired properties.  In this context, one uses such arguments to show the following:
: ''Given any fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP, with positive probability the randomized rounding process produces an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'' according to some desired criterion.

Finally, to make the third step computationally efficient,
one either shows that &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
with high probability (so that the step can remain randomized)
or one [[Derandomization|derandomizes]] the rounding step,
typically using the [[method of conditional probabilities]].
The latter method converts the randomized rounding process
into an efficient deterministic process that is guaranteed
to reach a good outcome.

== Comparison to other applications of the probabilistic method ==
The randomized rounding step differs from most applications of the [[probabilistic method]] in two respects:
# The [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of the rounding step is important.  It should be implementable by a fast (e.g. [[polynomial time]]) [[algorithm]].
# The probability distribution underlying the random experiment is a function of the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]] of the problem instance.  This fact is crucial to proving the [[Approximation_algorithm#Performance_guarantees|performance guarantee]] of the approximation algorithm --- that is, that for any problem instance, the algorithm returns a solution that approximates the ''optimal solution for that specific instance''.  In comparison, [[Probabilistic method|applications of the probabilistic method in combinatorics]] typically show the existence of structures whose features depend on other parameters of the input.  For example, consider [[Turán's theorem]], which can be stated as "any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices of average degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; must have an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of size at least &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.   (See  [[Method_of_conditional_probabilities#Turán.27s_theorem|this for a probabilistic proof of Turán's theorem]].) While there are graphs for which this bound is tight, there are also graphs which have independent sets much larger than &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the size of the independent set shown to exist by Turán's theorem in a graph may, in general, be much smaller than the maximum independent set for that graph.

== Set cover example ==
The following example illustrates how randomized rounding can be used to design an approximation algorithm for the [[Set Cover]] problem.

Fix any instance &lt;math&gt;\langle c, \mathcal S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of set cover over a universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;.

For step 1, let IP be the [[set cover#Integer linear program formulation|standard integer linear program for set cover]] for this instance.

For step 2, let LP be the [[linear programming relaxation]] of IP,
and compute an optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; to LP
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.
(This takes time polynomial in the input size.)

(The feasible solutions to LP are the vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
that assign each set &lt;math&gt;s \in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
a non-negative weight &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt;,
such that, for each element &lt;math&gt;e\in\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; ''covers'' &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
-- the total weight assigned to the sets containing &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
is at least 1, that is,
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x_s \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;
The optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
is a feasible solution whose cost
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(S)x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;
is as small as possible.)

----
Note that any set cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
gives a feasible solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;x_s=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x_s=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise).
The cost of this &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; equals the cost of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal C} c(s) = \sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(s) x_s.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the linear program LP is a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]]
of the given set-cover problem.

Since &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; has minimum cost among feasible solutions to the LP,
''the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover''.

=== Step 3: The randomized rounding step ===
Here is a description of the third step—the rounding step,
which must convert the minimum-cost fractional set cover &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
into a feasible integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to a true set cover).

The rounding step should produce an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that, with positive probability,
has cost  within a small factor of the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Then (since the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover),
the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; will be within a small factor of the optimal cost.

As a starting point, consider the most natural rounding scheme:
:: ''For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn, take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(1,x^*_s)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

With this rounding scheme,
the expected cost of the chosen sets is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s) x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;,
the cost of the fractional cover.
This is good.  Unfortunately the coverage is not good.
When the variables &lt;math&gt;x^*_s&lt;/math&gt; are small,
the probability that an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is about

:  &lt;math&gt;
\prod_{s\ni e} 1-x^*_s
\approx
\prod_{s\ni e} \exp(-x^*_s)
=
\exp\Big(-\sum_{s\ni e}x^*_s\Big)
\approx \exp(-1).
&lt;/math&gt;

So only a constant fraction of the elements will be covered in expectation.

To make &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; cover every element with high probability,
the standard rounding scheme
first ''scales up'' the rounding probabilities
by an appropriate factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
Here is the standard rounding scheme:
::  ''Fix a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.  For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,''
::  ''take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

Scaling the probabilities up by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
increases the expected cost by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
but makes coverage of all elements likely.
The idea is to choose &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as small
as possible so that all elements are provably
covered with non-zero probability.
Here is a detailed analysis.

----

==== Lemma (approximation guarantee for rounding scheme) ====
:: ''Fix &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \ln (2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.  With positive probability, the rounding scheme returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|) c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt; (and thus of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the cost of the optimal set cover).''

(Note: with care the  &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;
can be reduced to &lt;math&gt;\ln(|\mathcal U|)+O(\log\log|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Proof ====
The output &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the random rounding scheme has the desired properties
as long as none of the following "bad" events occur:
# the cost &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; exceeds &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;, or
# for some element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; fails to cover &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation of each  &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\lambda x_s^*&lt;/math&gt;.
By [[Expected_value#Linearity|linearity of expectation]],
the expectation of  &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s)\lambda x_s^*=\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, by [[Markov's inequality]], the probability of the first bad event
above is at most &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

For the remaining bad events (one for each element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;), note that,
since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; for any given element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;,
the probability that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is

:  &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\prod_{s\ni e} \big(1-\min(\lambda x^*_s,1) \big)
&amp; &lt; \prod_{s\ni e} \exp({-}\lambda x^*_s)
= \exp\Big({-}\lambda \sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \Big)
\\ 
&amp; \le \exp({-}\lambda)
= 1/(2|\mathcal U|).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(This uses the inequality &lt;math&gt;1+z\le e^z&lt;/math&gt;,
which is strict for &lt;math&gt;z \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.)

Thus, for each of the &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; elements,
the probability that the element is not covered is less than &lt;math&gt;1/(2\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[naive union bound]],
the probability that one of the &lt;math&gt;1+|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; bad events happens
is less than &lt;math&gt;1/2 + |\mathcal U|/(2\mathcal U)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, with positive probability there are no bad events
and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is a set cover of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
QED

=== Derandomization using the method of conditional probabilities ===
&lt;!-- Note: this subsection is linked to from [[method_of_conditional_probabilities]].  
     If you change the title here, please update that link --&gt;

The lemma above shows the ''existence'' of a set cover
of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log(|\mathcal U|)c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;).
In this context our goal is an efficient approximation algorithm,
not just an existence proof, so we are not done.

One approach would be to increase &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
a little bit, then show that the probability of success is at least, say, 1/4.
With this modification, repeating the random rounding step a few times
is enough to ensure a successful outcome with high probability.

That approach weakens the approximation ratio.
We next describe a different approach that yields
a deterministic algorithm that is guaranteed to
match the approximation ratio of the existence proof above.
The approach is called the [[method of conditional probabilities]].

The deterministic algorithm emulates the randomized rounding scheme:
it considers each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,
and chooses &lt;math&gt;x'_s \in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
But instead of making each choice ''randomly'' based on &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;,
it makes the choice ''deterministically'', so as to
''keep the conditional probability of failure, given the choices so far, below 1''.

==== Bounding the conditional probability of failure ====
We want to be able to set each variable &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in turn
so as to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1.
To do this, we need a good bound on the conditional probability of failure.
The bound will come by refining the original existence proof.
That proof implicitly bounds the probability of failure
by the expectation of the random variable
:  &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{c\cdot x'}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*} + |\mathcal U^{(m)}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
where
:  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(m)}= \Big\{ e  : \prod_{s\ni e} (1-x'_s) = 1\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the set of elements left uncovered at the end.

The random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; may appear a bit mysterious,
but it mirrors the probabilistic proof in a systematic way.
The first term in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; comes from applying [[Markov's inequality]]
to bound the probability of the first bad event (the cost is too high).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is too high.
The second term
counts the number of bad events of the second kind (uncovered elements).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; leaves any element uncovered.
Thus, in any outcome where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; must cover all the elements
and have cost meeting the desired bound from the lemma.
In short, if the rounding step fails, then &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies (by [[Markov's inequality]]) that
''&lt;math&gt;E[F]&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound on the probability of failure.''
Note that the argument above is implicit already in the proof of the lemma,
which also shows by calculation that &lt;math&gt;E[F] &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

To apply the method of conditional probabilities,
we need to extend the argument to bound the ''conditional'' probability of failure
as the rounding step proceeds.
Usually, this can be done in a systematic way,
although it can be technically tedious.

So, what about the ''conditional'' probability of failure as the rounding step iterates through the sets?
Since &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; in any outcome where the rounding step fails,
by [[Markov's inequality]], the ''conditional'' probability of failure
is at most the ''conditional'' expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we calculate the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
much as we calculated the unconditioned expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the original proof.
Consider the state of the rounding process at the end of some iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the sets considered so far
(the first &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the (partially assigned) vector &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
(so &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}_s&lt;/math&gt; is determined only if &lt;math&gt;s\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;).
For each set &lt;math&gt;s\not\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;,
let &lt;math&gt;p_s = \min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;
denote the probability with which &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; will be set to 1.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; contain the not-yet-covered elements.
Then the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
given the choices made so far, that is, given &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, is

: &lt;math&gt;
E[F | x^{(t)}]
~=~
\frac{\sum_{s\in S^{(t)}} c(s) x'_s 
+ \sum_{s\not\in S^{(t)}} c(s) p_s}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~+~
\sum_{e\in \mathcal U^{(t)}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined only after iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Keeping the conditional probability of failure below 1 ====
To keep the conditional probability of failure below 1,
it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; below 1.
To do this, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from increasing.
This is what the algorithm will do.
It will set &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in each iteration to ensure that
:: &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(m)}] \le E[F|x^{(m-1)}] \le \cdots \le E[F|x^{(1)}] \le E[F|x^{(0)}] &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;m=|\mathcal S|&lt;/math&gt;).

In the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;th iteration,
how can the algorithm set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
to ensure that &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}] \le E[F|S^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;?
It turns out that it can simply set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to ''minimize'' the resulting value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;.

To see why, focus on the point in time when iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; starts.
At that time, &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined,
but &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is not yet determined
--- it can take two possible values depending on how &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
is set in iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t-1)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x'^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_1&lt;/math&gt;,
denote the two possible values of  &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;,
depending on whether &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; is set to 0, or 1, respectively.
By the definition of conditional expectation,
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~=~ 
\Pr[x'_{s'}=0] E^{(t)}_0
+
\Pr[x'_{s'}=1] E^{(t)}_1.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since a weighted average of two quantities
is always at least the minimum of those two quantities,
it follows that
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~\ge~ \min( E^{(t)}_0, E^{(t)}_1 ).
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, setting &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to minimize the resulting value of
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
will guarantee that
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}] \le E[F | x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
This is what the algorithm will do.

In detail, what does this mean?
Considered as a function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
(with all other quantities fixed)
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;,
and the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; in that function is
:   &lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{s'}}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~-~
\sum_{e\in s'\cap \mathcal U_{t-1}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the algorithm should set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; to 0 if this expression is positive,
and 1 otherwise.  This gives the following algorithm.

=== Randomized-rounding algorithm for set cover ===

'''input:''' set system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;, universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;, cost vector &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

'''output:'''  set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; (a solution to the standard integer linear program for set cover)
----
# Compute a min-cost fractional set cover &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; (an optimal solution to the LP relaxation).
# Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda \leftarrow \ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;p_s \leftarrow \min(\lambda x^*_{s},1)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each &lt;math&gt;s'\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; do:
## Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S \leftarrow \mathcal S - \{s'\}&lt;/math&gt;.  &amp;nbsp; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; contains the not-yet-decided sets.)
## If &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;
\frac{c_{s'}}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
&gt;
\sum_{e\in s'\cap\mathcal U} \prod_{s\in \mathcal S, s\ni e}(1-p_s)
&lt;/math&gt;
##: then set &lt;math&gt;x'_s\leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;,
##: else set &lt;math&gt;x'_s\leftarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\leftarrow\mathcal U - s'&lt;/math&gt;.
##:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; contains the not-yet-covered elements.)
# Return &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.
----

==== lemma (approximation guarantee for algorithm) ====

:: ''The algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.''

==== proof ====
----
The algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;E[F \,|\, x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;, does not increase at each iteration.
Since this conditional expectation is initially less than 1 (as shown previously),
the algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation stays below 1.
Since the conditional probability of failure
is at most the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
in this way the algorithm
ensures that the conditional probability of failure stays below 1.
Thus, at the end, when all choices are determined,
the algorithm reaches a successful outcome.
That is, the algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times
the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.

=== Remarks ===
In the example above, the algorithm was guided by the conditional expectation of a random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
In some cases, instead of an exact conditional expectation,
an ''upper bound'' (or sometimes a lower bound)
on some conditional expectation is used instead.
This is called a [[pessimistic estimator]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Steady change''' is the persistent process of transformation in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic system]]. 

This is explained by the continuous generation, diffusion, accumulation and substitution of innovations by [[economic agent]]s as time moves on. This regular (and accelerating) phenomenon causes movement and crises in economic structures as measured by rates of growth of countries, regions, [[Economic sector|sectors]] and companies. 

The economy is an evolving system. It is thus to always unfold and change, to incessantly show novel behaviour, to surprise its actors and observers with emergent phenomena. The concept stands in contrast to the conventional concept of [[Steady state economy|"steady-state"]] in economics and is inspired by evolutionary insights in modern economic theory such as put forward by Nelson and Winter's book of 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Syntax diagrams''' (or '''railroad diagrams''') are a way to represent a [[context-free grammar]]. They represent a graphical alternative to [[Backus–Naur form]] or to [[EBNF]] as [[metalanguages]]. Early books using syntax diagrams include the "Pascal User Manual" written by [[Niklaus Wirth]] &lt;ref name="Wirth1974"&gt;[http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:3059/eth-3059-01.pdf Niklaus Wirth: ''The Programming Language Pascal.'' (July 1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; (diagrams start at page 47) and the Burroughs [[CANDE]] Manual.&lt;ref name="burroughs71"&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B6500_6700/5000318_B6700_CANDE_Oct72.pdf Burroughs B6700/B7700 ''Command AND Edit (CANDE) Language: Information Manual'']&lt;/ref&gt;. In the compilation field, textual representations like BNF or its variants are usually preferred. BNF is text-based, and used by compiler writers and parser generators. Railroad diagrams are visual, and may be more readily understood by laypeople, sometimes incorporated into graphic design. The canonical source defining the [[JSON]] data interchange format provides yet another example of a popular modern usage of these diagrams.

== Principle of syntax diagrams ==

The representation of a grammar is made of a set of syntax diagrams. Each diagram defines a non-terminal. There is a main diagram which defines the language in the following way: to belong to the language, a word must describe a path in the main diagram.

Each diagram has an entry point and an end point. The diagram describes possible paths between these two points by going through other nonterminals and terminals. Terminals are represented by round boxes while nonterminals are represented by square boxes.

== Example ==

We use arithmetic expressions as an example. First we provide a simplified BNF grammar:
&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;expression&gt; "+" &lt;term&gt;
&lt;term&gt;       ::= &lt;factor&gt; | &lt;term&gt; "*" &lt;factor&gt;
&lt;factor&gt;     ::= &lt;constant&gt; | &lt;variable&gt; | "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"
&lt;variable&gt;   ::= "x" | "y" | "z" 
&lt;constant&gt;   ::= &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; &lt;constant&gt;
&lt;digit&gt;      ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

&lt;/source&gt;

This grammar can also be expressed in [[EBNF]]:
&lt;source lang="ebnf"&gt;
expression = term | expression, "+" , term;
term       = factor | term, "*" , factor;
factor     = constant | variable | "(" , expression , ")";
variable   = "x" | "y" | "z"; 
constant   = digit , {digit};
digit      = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";

&lt;/source&gt;

One possible set of syntax diagrams for this grammar is:

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

Organisms can evolve physical and mental traits designed specifically to attract mates (e.g., the Peacock's tail) or to compete with members of one's own sex for access to the opposite sex (e.g., antlers).

| [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1964)
| '''''[[Inclusive fitness]] (or "gene's eye view", "kin selection") / Evolution of sexual reproduction'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.
| Altruism toward kin, parental investment, the behavior of the social insects with sterile workers (e.g., ants).

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1972)
| '''''[[Parental Investment]] Theory / Parent - Offspring Conflict / Reproductive Value'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1971)
| '''''"[[Tit for Tat]]" Reciprocity'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions. One plays nice with non-kin if a mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship is maintained across multiple interactions, while cheating is punished.
| Cheater detection, emotions of revenge and guilt, etc.
|-
| Non-kin, large groups governed by rules and laws

| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others
| '''''[[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)#Patterns of reciprocity|Generalized Reciprocity]]'''''

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|editor=Bernard Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971|pages=136–179|publisher=Aldine Transaction (Chicago)|date=1972|isbn=0-202-02005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=Parent-offspring conflict|volume=14|issue=1|pages=249–264|date=1974|doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|journal=American Zoologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermophile''' is an organism—a type of [[extremophile]]—that thrives at relatively high temperatures, between '''{{convert|41|and|122|C|F}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | date=2006| author=Madigan MT| author2=Martino JM | edition=11th |pages=136 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=0-13-196893-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Takai T |display-authors= etal | title = Cell proliferation at 122°C and isotopically heavy CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production by a hyperthermophilic methanogen under high-pressure cultivation

Thermophilic [[eubacteria]] are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid19000750"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horiike T |author2=Miyata D |author3=Hamada K |display-authors=etal |title=Phylogenetic construction of 17 bacterial phyla by new method and carefully selected orthologs |journal=Gene |volume=429 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–64 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19000750 |pmc=2648810 |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2008.10.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1119(08)00524-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermophiles are found in various [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]ly heated regions of the [[Earth]], such as hot springs like those in [[Yellowstone National Park]] (see image) and [[deep sea]] [[hydrothermal vent]]s, as well as decaying plant matter, such as [[peat bogs]] and compost.

Thermophiles can survive at high temperatures, whereas other bacteria would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures. 

The [[enzyme]]s in thermophiles necessarily function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in [[molecular biology]], for example, heat-stable [[DNA polymerase]]s for [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]), and in washing agents.

"Thermophile" is derived from the {{lang-el|θερμότητα}} (''thermotita''), meaning heat, and {{lang-el|φίλια}} (''philia''), love.

==Classification==
Thermophiles can be classified in various ways.  One classification sorts these organisms according to their optimal growth temperatures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stetter, K.|title=History of discovery of the first hyperthermophiles|journal=Extremophiles|year=2006|volume=10|pages=357–362|doi=10.1007/s00792-006-0012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simply thermophiles: 50–64 °C
# Extreme thermophiles 65–79 °C
# Hyperthermophiles 80 °C and beyond, but not &lt; 50 °C.

In a related classification, thermophiles are sorted as follows: 
# Obligate thermophiles (also called extreme thermophiles) require such high temperatures for growth, whereas
# Facultative thermophiles (also called moderate thermophiles) can thrive at high temperatures, but also at lower temperatures (below {{convert|50|C}}).
# [[Hyperthermophile]]s are particularly extreme thermophiles for which the optimal temperatures are above {{convert|80|C}}.

[[File:Thermophilic bacteria.jpg|thumb|A colony of thermophiles in the outflow of [[Mickey Hot Springs]], [[Oregon]],  the water temperature is approximately 
{{convert|60|C}}.]]

Many of the hyperthermophiles Archea require elemental [[sulfur]] for growth. Some are [[anaerobe]]s that use the sulfur instead of [[oxygen]] as an [[electron acceptor]] during [[cellular respiration]]. Some are [[lithotroph]]s that oxidize sulphur to create [[sulfuric acid]] as an energy source, thus requiring the microorganism to be adapted to very low [[pH]] (i.e., it is an [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] as well as thermophile). These organisms are inhabitants of hot, sulfur-rich environments usually associated with [[volcanism]], such as [[hot springs]], [[geysers]], and [[fumaroles]].  In these places, especially in Yellowstone National Park, [[wiktionary:zonation|zonation]] of microorganisms according to their temperature optima occurs. Often, these organisms are colored, due to the presence of [[photosynthetic]] pigments.

==Thermophile versus mesophile==
Thermophiles can be discriminated from [[mesophile]]s from genomic features. For example, the [[GC-content]] levels in the coding regions of some signatures genes were consistently identified as correlated with the temperature range condition when the association analysis was applied to mesophilic and thermophilic organisms regardless of their phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity, or habitat conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zheng H |author2=Wu H |title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=11 |pages=S7 |date=December 2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7 |pmc=3024870 |pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene transfer and genetic exchange==
''Sulfolobus solfataricus'' and ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius'' are hyperthermophilic archaea.  When these organisms are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced.&lt;ref name=Frols08&gt;&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |author=Fröls S |author2=Ajon M |author3=Wagner M |author4=Teichmann D |author5=Zolghadr B |author6= Folea M |author7=Boekema EJ |author8=Driessen AJ |author9=Schleper C |author10=Albers SV |title=UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation |journal=Mol.

They suggested that this process is crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperature.  Also it has been suggested that DNA transfer in ''Sulfolobus'' may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are associated with species-specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage [see [[Transformation (genetics)]]].

The '''ticking time bomb scenario''' is a [[thought experiment]] that has been used in the [[ethics]] debate over whether [[torture]] can ever be justified. As a thought experiment, there is no need that the scenario be plausible; it need only serve to highlight ethical considerations. The scenario can be formulated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that a person with knowledge of an imminent [[terrorism|terrorist attack]], that will kill many people, is in the hands of the authorities and that he will disclose the information needed to prevent the attack only if he is tortured. Should he be tortured?&lt;ref name="APT"&gt;[http://www.apt.ch/content/files_res/tickingbombscenario.pdf Defusing the Ticking Bomb Scenario: Why we must say No to torture, Always], [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scenario can be better understood through the arguments of those who respond to it; the [[consequentialist]] argument is that nations, even those that legally disallow torture, can justify its use if they have a terrorist in custody who possesses critical knowledge, such as the location of a [[time bomb]] or a [[weapon of mass destruction]] that will soon explode and cause great loss of life. Opponents to the argument usually begin by exposing certain assumptions that tend to be hidden by initial presentations of the scenario and tend to obscure the true costs of permitting torture in "real-life" scenarios—e.g., the assumption that the person is in fact a terrorist, whereas in real life there usually remains uncertainty about whether the person is in fact a terrorist and that he has useful information&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spino|first1=	Joseph|last2=Dellarosa Cummins|first2=Denise|title=The Ticking Time Bomb: When the Use of Torture Is and Is Not Endorsed|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|date=August 2014|volume=5|pages=543–563|doi=10.1007/s13164-014-0199-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and rely on legal, philosophical/moral, and empirical grounds to reaffirm the need for the absolute prohibition of torture.  There is also uncertainty about the [[effectiveness of torture]], and much opposition to torture is based on the fact it is not effective rather than any moral issue.

==Background==

Philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] has been regarded as the "father" of the ticking time bomb argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.643/|title=The Fire-Raisers: Bentham and Torture|first=Jeremy|last=Davies|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|doi=10.16995/ntn.643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his 1804 essay ''Means of extraction for extraordinary occasions'':

{{quote|Suppose an occasion to arise, in which a suspicion is entertained, as strong as that which would be received as a sufficient ground for arrest and commitment as for felony — a suspicion that at this very time a considerable number of individuals are actually suffering, by illegal violence inflictions equal in intensity to those which if inflicted by the hand of justice, would universally be spoken of under the name of torture. For the purpose of rescuing from torture these hundred innocents, should any scruple be made of applying equal or superior torture, to extract the requisite information from the mouth of one criminal, who having it in his power to make known the place where at this time the enormity was practicing or about to be practiced, should refuse to do so?}}

The concept was popularized in the 1960s in the novel ''[[Les Centurions]]'' by [[Jean Lartéguy]] which is set during the [[Algerian war]]. The version in the novel has the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twining|first1=WL|last2=Twining|first2=PE|title=Bentham on torture|journal=N. Ir. LQ|date=1973|volume=24|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The evidence in support of the contention that he has the relevant information would satisfy the requirements of evidence for convicting him of an offence.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that he is likely to tell the truth if severe torture is threatened, and, if necessary, applied to him.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that no other means would have the effect of compelling him to tell the truth.
# There are grounds for believing that if the information is obtained quickly, there is a good chance of defusing the bomb before it goes off.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the likely damage to be caused by the bomb will include death of many citizens, the maiming of others, including the infliction of much more severe pain on others with much more lasting effect than will be the effect of the infliction of torture on the person who has been captured;
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the torturing will not have consequences which would be worse than the damage likely to result from the bomb going off.
According to [[Darius Rejali]], a professor of political science at [[Reed College]], the possibility of sudden, massive destruction of innocent life provided French liberals with a more acceptable justification for committing torture.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070219fa_fact_mayer | title=Whatever it takes.

==Views in favor of accepting torture in emergencies==
[[Alan Dershowitz]], a prominent American defense attorney, surprised some observers by giving limited support to the idea that torture could be justified. He argued that human nature can lead to unregulated abuse "off the books". Therefore, it would be better if there were a regulated procedure through which an interrogator could request a "torture warrant" and that requiring a warrant would establish a paper trail of accountability. Torturers, and those who authorize torture, could be held to account for excesses. Dershowitz's suggested torture warrants, similar to search warrants, arrest warrants and phone tap warrants, would spell out the limits on the techniques that interrogators may use, and the extent to which they may abridge a suspect's rights.

In September 2002, when reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book, ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'', [[Richard Posner]], legal scholar and judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]'', "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to prevent the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]] in [[Times Square]], torture should be used--and will be used--to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|title=Review-a-Day - Why Terrorism Works Understanding The by  Alan M Dershowitz, reviewed by The New Republic Online - Powell's Books|work=powells.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012718/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|archivedate=2012-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views in favor of torturing the relatives of suspects===
In February 2010 [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote a column for ''[[The Independent]]'', arguing that the British government would have not just the right, but the duty, to torture if there was a ticking bomb, and that they should torture the relatives of suspects if they believed that doing so would yield information that would avert a terrorist attack: "It came, in the form of a devilish intellectual challenge. 'Let's take your hypothesis a bit further. We have captured a terrorist, but he is a hardened character. We cannot be certain that he will crack in time. We have also captured his wife and children'. After much agonising, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one answer to [[Sydney Kentridge]]'s question. [[collective punishment|Torture the wife and children]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/bruce-anderson/bruce-anderson-we-not-only-have-a-right-to-use-torture-we-have-a-duty-1899555.html We not only have a right to use torture. We have a duty], Bruce Anderson, ''[[The Independent]]'', 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views rejecting torture under all circumstances==
Some human rights organizations, professional and academic experts, and military and intelligence leaders have absolutely rejected the idea that torture is ever legal or acceptable, even in a so-called ticking bomb situation.&lt;ref name="APT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; They have expressed grave concern about the way the dramatic force and artificially simple moral answers the ticking bomb thought-experiment seems to offer, have manipulated and distorted the legal and moral perceptions, reasoning and judgment of both the general population and military and law enforcement officials. They reject the proposition, implicit or explicit, that certain acts of torture are justifiable, even desirable. They believe that simplistic responses to the scenario may lead well-intentioned societies down a slippery slope to legalized and systematic torture. They point out that no evidence of any real-life situation meeting all the criteria to constitute a pure ticking bomb scenario has ever been presented to the public, and that such a situation is highly unlikely.{{efn|Interviewed on ''Face the Nation'' in May 2009, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] cited [[CIA]] memos that gave two examples supporting the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] in a ticking bomb scenario, claiming that the interrogation of [[Abu Zubaydah]] prevented a plot to detonate a ''[[dirty bomb]]'' in [[Washington DC]] and similarly that information forced from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] prevented an attack on [[Los Angeles]]. These claims were later repeated in August 2009 during a FOX news interview and are still cited as valid examples. However, in 2008, the claims made in the 2007 CIA memos were investigated by the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s Office of Professional Responsibility and heavily criticized. The Department of Justice report, released in February 2009, stated that Zubaydah had supplied the information before he was tortured and that no further credible information had been obtained from the torture itself. In the case of Mohammed, the attack on Los Angeles had already been exposed before his capture and his admissions under torture were little more than white noise given to end it.}}

As well, torture can be criticized as a poor vehicle for discovering truth, as people experiencing torture, once broken, are liable to make anything up in order to stop the pain and can become unable to tell the difference between fact and fiction under intense psychological pressure. Additionally, since the terrorist presumably knows that the timer is ticking, he has an excellent reason to lie and give false information under torture in order to misdirect his interrogators; merely giving a convincing answer which the investigators will waste time checking out makes it more likely that the bomb will go off, and of course once the bomb has gone off, not only has the terrorist won, but there is also no further point in torturing him, except perhaps as revenge.

Others point out that the ticking-bomb torture proponents adopt an extremely short-term view, which impoverishes their [[consequentialism]]. Using torture—or even declaring that one is prepared to accept its use—makes other groups of people much more likely to use torture themselves in the long run. The consequence is likely to be a long-term increase in violence. This long-term effect is so serious that the person making the torture decision cannot possibly (according to this argument) make a reasonable estimate of its results. Thus the decision-maker has no grounds for certainty that the value of the lives saved from the ticking bomb will outweigh the value of the lives lost because of the subsequent disorder. He or she cannot arrive at a successful accounting of consequences.

This anti-torture argument, in fact, works by positing that human knowledge has intrinsic limits. An analogous argument holds that human decision-makers are fundamentally prone in certain situations to believe that their judgment is better than it is, and that, to be ethical, they must pre-commit themselves to a particular course of action in those situations. Knowing that, under stress, they will never be able to accurately assess the likely success of torture in obtaining information needed to prevent an attack, humans thus pre-commit to not torture. In general, this family of arguments faults the "ticking-bomb" scenario for implicitly including an incorrect presumption that the decision-maker can know in advance the outcome of torture, either in the short run (likelihood that it will prevent an attack) or the long run (likelihood that it will not set off a general increase in human violence).

[[Joe Navarro]], one of the [[FBI]]’s top experts in questioning techniques, told [[The New Yorker]]:

{{quote|Only a [[psychopath]] can torture and be unaffected. You don’t want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/the-politics-of-torture-scenes-on-24-shame-on-you-for-your-lies-joel-surnow "The Politics Of TV Torture Shown On '24' - Shame On You For Your Lies, Joel Surnow"] by Nikki Finke, ''[[LA Weekly]]'', February 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-military-tells-jack-bauer-cut-out-the-torture-scenes--or-else-436143.html "US Military Tells Jack Bauer: Cut Out the Torture Scenes ... or Else!"] by Andrew Buncombe, ''[[The Independent]]'', February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which was adopted on December 10, 1984, and entered into force on June 26, 1987, explicitly states in Article 2.2 that:

{{quote|No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[failed state|political instability]] or any other [[state of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46.  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Implausibility===
Critics of the thought experiment scenario maintain that it is essentially implausible, based on simultaneous presence of numerous unlikely factors. This is particularly acute in fictional exploration of the scenario.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For example, in perhaps the most common variants on the scenario, one must assume that torturers know, with a reasonable degree of certainty that some form of deadly attack is imminent, but lack a crucial component of that plan, such as its precise location.  They must also have in their custody someone who they are reasonably certain has said information and would talk under torture or threat of torture.  They must then be able to accurately distinguish between true and false information which the subject may supply under torture.  They must then be able to use this information to form a plan of response which is effective at stopping the planned attack.  All of this must occur within a limited time frame allowed by the "ticking bomb".

==Effect of fiction==
Works of fiction, such as the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', often rely on ticking time bomb scenarios for dramatic effect. According to the [[Parents Television Council]], given that each season represents a 24-hour period, [[Jack Bauer]] encounters someone who needs [[Critical reaction to 24 (TV series)#Torture|torturing]] to reveal a ticking bomb on average 12 times per day.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lithwick | first = Dahlia | date = July 26, 2008 | title = The Fiction Behind Torture Policy | work = [[Newsweek]] | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/149009 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Chertoff]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] under the [[George W. Bush administration]], declared that ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' "reflects real life", [[John Yoo]], the former [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] lawyer who produced the [[torture memos]] cited Bauer in support while [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]] went further, "Jack Bauer saved [[Los Angeles]]... He saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Are you going to convict Jack Bauer?".&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; One of the shows' creators stated:

{{quote|Most terrorism experts will tell you that the ‘ticking time bomb’ situation never occurs in real life, or very rarely. But on our show it happens every week.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The show uses the same [[enhanced interrogation|techniques]] that are used by the U.S. against terrorist suspects during the [[War on Terror]]. [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Patrick Finnegan, the dean of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], and others, objected to the central theme of the show—that the letter of American law must be sacrificed for the country’s security—as it had an adverse effect on the training of actual American soldiers by advocating unethical and illegal behavior. As Finnegan said:

{{quote|The kids see it, and say, 'If torture is wrong, what about "24"?'}}

He continued,

{{quote|The disturbing thing is that although torture may cause [[Jack Bauer]] some angst, it is always the patriotic thing to do.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The "ticking time bomb scenario" is subject of the drama ''The Dershowitz Protocol'' by Canadian author Robert Fothergill. In that play, the American government has established a protocol of "intensified interrogation" for terrorist suspects which requires participation of the [[FBI]], [[CIA]] and the Department of Justice. The drama deals with the psychological pressure and the tense triangle of competences under the overriding importance that each participant has to negotiate the actions with his conscience.

In [[time management]], '''timeboxing''' allocates a fixed time period, called a '''timebox''', within which planned activity takes place. It is employed by several [[project management]] approaches and for personal time management.  {{Rquote|right|Timebox—don't scopebox| Mary Poppendieck | ''Leading Lean Software Development''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poppendieck | first = Mary | title = Leading Lean Software Development: Results Are Not the Point | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | page = 139 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-321-62070-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In project management ==

Timeboxing is used as a [[project planning]] technique.

In [[project management]], there are generally considered to be [[Project management triangle|three constraints]] of time (sometimes [[Schedule (project management)|schedule]]), cost (sometimes [[budget]]), and [[Scope (project management)|scope]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmanagement.net.au/triple_constraints ''What are the Triple Constraints in Project Management''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060820021929/http://www.projectmanagement.net.au/triple_constraints |date=2006-08-20 }}, article by Rod Hutchings on [http://projectmanagement.net.au/ Project Management Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216052557/http://projectmanagement.net.au/ |date=2009-02-16 }} (22 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chat"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Carl | last=Chatfield | title=A short course in project management | url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project/HA102354821033.aspx| publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobson | first = Michael | title = The triple constraints in project management | publisher = Management Concepts | location = Vienna, Va | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56726-152-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kanabar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leffingwell/&gt; with [[Quality (business)|quality]] often added as a fourth constraint (represented as the middle of a triangle),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Snedaker |first= Susan |author2=Nels Hoenig  |title= How to Cheat at IT Project Management |publisher= Syngress |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-59749-037-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Kent | title = Extreme programming eXplained : embrace change | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Reading, MA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-61641-6 | pages=15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangelo&gt;{{cite book | last = Dangelo | first = Mark | title = Innovative relevance : realigning the organization for profit : it is not a battle for the "shore lines" - it's a struggle for purpose | publisher = iUniverse | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-595-67081-9 | page=53 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQx3lab0KnIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that a change in one constraint will affect the others.&lt;ref name=Kanabar&gt;{{cite book | last = Kanabar | first = Vijay | title = MBA Fundamentals : Project Management | publisher = Kaplan Pub | location = New York | year = 2008 | page = 51 | isbn = 978-1-4277-9744-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without timeboxing, projects usually work to a fixed scope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Godin |first= Seth |title= Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application |publisher= 37signals }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case when it becomes clear that some deliverables cannot be completed within the planned timescales, either the deadline has to be extended (to allow more time to complete the fixed scope) or more people are involved (to complete the fixed scope in the same time). Often both happen, resulting in delayed delivery, increased costs, and often reduced quality (as per [[The Mythical Man-Month]] principle).

With timeboxing, the deadline is fixed, meaning that the scope would have to be reduced. As this means organizations have to focus on completing the most important deliverables first, timeboxing often goes hand-in-hand with a scheme for prioritizing of deliverables (such as with the [[MoSCoW method]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36755892|title=DSDM, dynamic systems development method : the method in practice|last=Jennifer.|first=Stapleton,|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0201178893|location=Harlow, England|oclc=36755892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== To manage risk ===

Timeboxes are used as a form of [[risk management]], to explicitly identify uncertain task/time relationships, i.e., work that may easily extend past its deadline. Time constraints are often a primary driver in planning and should not be changed without considering project or sub-project critical paths. That is, it's usually important to meet deadlines. Risk factors for missed deadlines can include complications upstream of the project, planning errors within the project, team-related issues, or faulty execution of the plan. Upstream issues might include changes in project mission or backing/support from management. A common planning error is inadequate task breakdown, which can lead to underestimation of the time required to perform the work. Team-related issues can include trouble with inter-team communication; lack of experience or required cross-functionality; lack of commitment/drive/motivation (i.e. poor team building and management).

To stay on deadline, the following actions against the triple constraints are commonly evaluated:

* Reduce scope: drop requirements of lower impact (the ones that will not be directly missed by the user)
* Time is the fixed constraint here
* Increase cost: e.g., add overtime or resources

=== Adoption in software development ===

Many successful [[software development]] projects use timeboxing, especially smaller ones.&lt;ref name=Capers&gt;For all project types time boxing ranked 23 and rated "Very Good Practice"; for small (1000 [[function point]]) projects ranked 7 and rated a "Best Practice" by the survey in {{cite book | last = Jones | first = Capers | title = Software engineering best practices lessons from successful projects in the top companies | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-07-162162-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting timeboxing more than tripled developer productivity at [[DuPont]] in the '80s.&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; In some cases, applications were completely delivered within the time estimated to complete just a [[Functional specification|specification]].&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; However, [[Steve McConnell]] argues that not every product is suitable&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; and that timeboxing should only be used after the customer agrees to cut features, not quality.&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; There is little evidence for strong adoption amongst the largest class of projects.&lt;ref name=Capers/&gt;

Timeboxing has been adopted by some notable [[software development methodologies]]:

* [[Dynamic Systems Development Method|Dynamic systems development method]] (DSDM)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In [[lean software development]], [[Kanban|pull scheduling]] with [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] provides short term time management. When developing a large and complex system, when long term [[planning]] is required timeboxing is [[Abstraction layer|layered]] above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poppendieck | first = Mary | title = Leading Lean Software Development : Results are not the Point | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | pages = 137–140 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-321-62070-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rapid application development]] (RAD) [[software development process]] features [[iterative and incremental development|iterative development]] and [[software prototyping]]. According to [[Steve McConnell]], timeboxing is a "Best Practice" for RAD and a typical timebox length should be 60–120 days.&lt;ref name=McConnell&gt;{{cite book | last = McConnell | first = Steve | title = Rapid Development : taming wild software schedules | publisher = Microsoft Press | location = Redmond, Wash | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-55615-900-5 | pages=575–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] was influenced by ideas of timeboxing and [[iterative development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coplien | first = James | title = Lean Architecture for Agile Software Development | publisher = Wiley | location = Chichester Hoboken, N.J | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lpvY36MPMUwC | page = 25 | isbn = 978-0-470-68420-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular timeboxed units known as [[Sprint (scrum)|sprints]] form the basic unit of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohn | first = Mike | title = Succeeding with Agile : Software Development using Scrum | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2010 | pages = 257–284 | isbn = 978-0-321-57936-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical length for a sprint is 30 days.&lt;ref name=Schwaber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leffingwell | first = Dean | title = Agile Software Requirements : Lean requirements practices for teams, programs, and the enterprise | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-321-63584-6 | pages = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pTExbNmZwZUC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint planning, sprint retrospective and sprint review meetings are timeboxed.&lt;ref name=Schwaber&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwaber | first = Ken | title = Agile Project Management with Scrum | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc | location = New York | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RpYX01XVMksC | isbn = 978-0-7356-3790-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Extreme programming]] methodologies, development planning is timeboxed into iterations typically 1, 2 or 3 weeks in length. The business [[Requirement prioritization|revalues]] pending [[user story|user stories]] before each iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Kent | title = Extreme programming eXplained : embrace change | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Reading, MA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-61641-6 | pages=85–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agile software development]] advocates moving from ''plan driven'' to ''value driven'' development. Quality and time are fixed but flexibility allowed in scope. Delivering the most important features first leads to an earlier [[return on investment]] than the [[waterfall model]].&lt;ref name=Leffingwell&gt;{{cite book | last = Leffingwell | first = Dean | title = Agile Software Requirements : Lean requirements practices for teams, programs, and the enterprise | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-321-63584-6 | pages = 17–19 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pTExbNmZwZUC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of detailed specifications typically is the result of a lack of time, or the lack of knowledge of the desired end result (solution). In many types of projects, and especially in software engineering, analyzing and defining ''all'' requirements and specifications before the start of the realization phase is impossible. Timeboxing can be a favorable type of contracting for projects in which the deadline is ''the'' most critical aspect and when not all requirements are completely specified up front. This also allows for new feedback or insights discovered during the project to be reflected in the end result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In personal time management ==

''Timeboxing'' can be used for personal tasks, as well, in which case it uses a reduced scale of time (e.g., thirty minutes) and of deliverables (e.g., a household chore instead of project deliverable). 

Personal timeboxing is also said to act as a [[Life hacking|life hack]] to help curb perfectionist tendencies (by setting a firm time and not overcommitting to a task)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyamilazy.com/40-super-effective-ways-to-stop-procrastinating/ |title=40 Ways To Stop Procrastinating |last1=Frankton |first1=James |date=4 April 2014 |website=Why Am I Lazy? |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also enhance creativity and focus (by creating a sense of urgency or increased pressure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pash | first = Adam | title = Lifehacker the guide to working smarter, faster, and better | publisher = Wiley | location = Indianapolis, Ind | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-118-13345-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d-FYJceblAMC | at=Hack 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with other methods ==

Timeboxing acts as a building block in other personal time management methods:

* The [[Pomodoro Technique]] is based on 25 minute timeboxes of focused concentration separated by breaks allowing the mind to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nöteberg | first=Staffan | title=Pomodoro Technique Illustrated | publisher = Pragmatic Bookshelf | location = Raleigh, N.C | isbn=978-1-934356-50-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andy Hunt (author)|Andy Hunt]] gives timeboxing as his 'T' in [[SMART criteria|SMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Andrew | title = Pragmatic thinking and learning : refactor your wetware | publisher = Pragmatic | location = Raleigh | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-934356-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], a '''tribe''' is a [[human]] [[social group]]. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with [[colonialism]]. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be [[wikt:primitive|primitive]] and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as [[nation]]s, [[state (polity)|state]]s, and forms of [[kinship]].

In some places, such as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|India]] and [[Tribe (Native American)|North America]], tribes are [[Polity|polities]] that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.

== Etymology ==
The word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century [[Middle English]]-literature, in reference to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]]. The Middle English word is derived from Old French ''tribu'' and, in turn, from Latin ''tribus'' (plural ''tribūs''), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into ''tribūs'' known as the ''Ramnes'' (or ''Ramnenses''), ''Tities'' (or ''Titienses''), and ''Luceres'', corresponding, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], to the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Sabines]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] respectively. The ''Ramnes'' were named after [[Romulus]], leader of the Latins, ''Tities'' after [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines, and ''Luceres'' after [[Lucumo]], leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the [[Tribal Assembly]] (''comitia tributa'') in the [[Roman Republic]] included 35 tribes (four "urban tribes" and 31 "rural tribes"). According to [[Livy]], the three "tribes" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.

The term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''tri-'' ("three") and ''bhew'' ("to be"). The classicist [[Gregory Nagy]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]],''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the linguist [[Émile Benveniste]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origines de la formation des noms en indo-européen'',  {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Umbrian]] ''trifu'' (equivalent of the Latin ''tribus'') is apparently derived from a combination of ''*tri-'' and ''*bhu-'', where the second element is cognate with the Greek root ''phúō'' φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek [[wikt:φυλή|''phulē'']] φυλή "clan, race, people" (plural ''phylai'' φυλαί). The Greek ''[[polis]]'' ("state" or "city") was, like the Roman state, divided into three ''phylai''.

In Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in [[New Latin]] and instead of ''tribus''  the word ''phyle'' was used, derived from the Greek ''phulē''&lt;!-- 'and ultimately the Hebrew, meaning or "sceptre" ' ← Commented this out as the connection, if any, is not at all clear  --&gt;. In the historical sense, "tribe", "race" and "clan" have often been used interchangeably.

==Usage controversy==
The term and concept of a ''tribe'' is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the [[social science]]s. The term ''tribe'' was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] writes:
:The tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.&lt;ref name="MITCHELL-1970-83"&gt;Mitchell, Clyde J. 1970. "Tribe and Social Change in South Central Africa: A Situational Approach" in Gutkind, Peter C. W. Editor. ''The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa'', p. 83. [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that "like the word ''Indian'', ''[t]ribe'' is a word that has connotations of colonialism."&lt;ref name="ORTOLEVA-2013-95"&gt;Ortoleva, Matthew. 2013. "We Face East" in Goggin, Peter N. Editor. ''Environmental Rhetoric and Ecologies of Place'', p. 95. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|9781135922658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes and nations ==
Considerable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over [[cultural evolution]] and [[colonialism]].  In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable.  Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an "ethnic group" or of a "nation".  [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] research has challenged all of these notions.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Elman Service]] presented a [[Sociopolitical typology|system of classification]] for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:

# [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[Band society|bands]] that are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]
# Tribal societies with some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige
# [[Social stratification|Stratified]] tribal societies led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] (see [[Chiefdom]])
# [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments

In his 1975 study, ''The Notion of the Tribe'', [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Morton Fried|Morton H. Fried]] provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes.  Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes.  He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Morton H. Fried (1972) ''The Notion of Tribe''.  Cummings Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]
Fried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such "secondary" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak [[leadership]]. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army.  Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called "scheduled" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form "secondary" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.

'''Ulrich Beck''' (15 May 1944 – 1 January 2015) was a well known [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], and one of the most cited social scientists in the world during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;PDF at www.manuelcastells.info&lt;/ref&gt;  His work focused on questions of uncontrollability, [[Sociology of scientific ignorance|ignorance]] and [[uncertainty]] in the [[modernity|modern age]], and he coined the terms "[[risk society]]" and "[[second modernity]]" or "[[reflexive modernization]]". He also tried to overturn national perspectives that predominated in sociological investigations with a [[cosmopolitanism]] that acknowledges the interconnectedness of the [[modern history|modern world]]. He was a professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] and also held appointments at the ''Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme'' (FMSH) in Paris, and at the [[London School of Economics]].

==Life==
[[File:UlrichBeck.jpg|thumb|Ulrich Beck in his flat in Munich, 1999]]
Beck was born in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomeranian]] town of [[Stolp]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (now Słupsk in [[Poland]]), in 1944, and grew up in [[Hanover]]. He began university studies with a focus on law at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and from 1966 onwards studied [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[political science]] at the University of Munich. Starting in 1972, after earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]], he was employed at Munich as a sociologist. In 1979 he qualified as a university lecturer with a [[habilitation]] thesis. He received appointments as professor at the universities of [[University of Münster|Münster]] (1979–1981) and [[Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg|Bamberg]] (1981–1992). From 1992 until his death, Beck was professor of sociology and director of the Institute for Sociology at the University of Munich. He received numerous international awards and honors, including election to the Council and Executive Board of the German Society for Sociology.

From 1995 to 1997 he was a member of the ''Kommission für Zukunftsfragen der Freistaaten Bayern und Sachsen'' ([[Bavaria]]n and [[Saxony|Saxon]] State Commission for Questions Concerning the Future). Beginning in 1999, he was the speaker of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] research programme on [[Reflexive modernization|reflexive modernity]].

From 1999 to 2009 Beck was a spokesman of the Collaborative Reflexive Modernization Research Centre 536, an interdisciplinary consortium of four universities in the Munich area funded and overseen by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (DFG)]].&lt;ref&gt;Collaborative Reflexive Modetnization Research Centre 536&lt;/ref&gt; Beck's theory of interdisciplinary reflexive modernization on a basis of a wide range of topics in appropriate research was empirically tested. The theory of reflexive modernization works from the basic idea that the rise of the modern industrial age produces side-effects across the globe that provide the institutional basis and coordinates that modern nation-states question, modify, and open for political action.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Wolfgang Bonß (ed.): ''The modernization of modernity''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main 2001; Ulrich Beck and Christoph Lau (ed.): ''Delimitation and Decision''. Frankfurt 2004 special issue of the journal Social World: theory and empirical reflexive modernization, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active as sociologist and public intellectual in Germany and throughout the world, regularly intervening in debates on the European Union, climate change and nuclear energy. At the time of his death, he and his international research group were only 1.5 years into the 5-year research project "Methodological Cosmopolitanism – in the Laboratory of Climate Change" (the Cosmo-Climate Research Project), of which Beck was the [[Principal investigator]]. For this research project he received the prestigious ERC Advanced Grant, scheduled to terminate in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://erc.europa.eu/methodological-cosmopolitanism-laboratory-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Beck, sociologists David Tyfield and [[Anders Blok]] lead work packages within the overall project.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.soc.ku.dk/english/about/news/project_greening/&lt;/ref&gt; The project also fostered international research collaboration with various research 'hubs' in East Asia through the [[Europe-Asia Research Network (EARN)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cosmostudies.com/east-asian-research-network/&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with EARN, Beck and sociologist Sang-Jin Han had been set to lead a 2-year project for the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] beginning in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://isa-global-dialogue.net/in-memory-of-professor-ulrich-beck-january-8-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was a member of the Board of Trustees at the [[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Jewish Center in Munich]] and a member of the German branch of [[PEN International]].

He was married to the German [[social scientist]] [[Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim]]. He died of a cardiac infarction on 1 January 2015, at the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/06/ulrich-beck Ulrich Beck obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research contributions==
For 25 years, Beck delivered new diagnoses to the following question: How can social and political thought and action in the face of radical global change (environmental destruction, financial crisis, global warming, the crisis of democracy and the nation-state institutions) be intertwined in a new modernity?&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck: ''World Risk Society''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A radicalized modernity, for Beck, attacks its own foundations. Institutions such as the nation-state and the family are globalized 'from the inside'.

Beck studied [[modernization]], ecological problems, [[individual]]ization and [[globalization]]. Later in his career, he embarked on exploring the changing conditions of work in a world of increasing global [[capitalism]], declining influence of unions and flexibilisation of the labour process, a then new theory rooted in the concept of [[cosmopolitanism]]. Beck also contributed a number of new words to German and anglophone sociology, including "[[risk society]]", "[[second modernity]]", [[reflexive modernization]] and [[Brazilianization]] ([[Brasilianisierung]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} According to Beck, all contemporary political thinking emanates from the methodological nationalism of political thought and sociology (and other social sciences).&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Edgar Grande: Beyond methodological nationalism: Non-European and European variations of the second modernity, in: Social World 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Risk society}} Risk society was coined by Ulrich Beck and [[Anthony Giddens]] during the 1980s. According to Beck and Giddens, the traditional industrial class structure of modern society is breaking apart. Globalization creates risks that concern people from all different classes; for example, radioactivity, pollution, and even unemployment. Affluent households act to insulate themselves from these risks, but cannot do so for some; for example global environmental change. The poor suffer them. He points out that risks are also socially constructed and some risks are perceived as more dangerous because they are discussed in mass media more frequently, such as terrorism. Risk society leads to analysis of risks, causing prejudgment.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Joachim Möller, Achim Schmillen: ''Hohe Konzentration auf wenige – steigendes Risiko für alle'' (IAB-Kurzbericht 24/2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was the editor of the sociological journal, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Soziale Welt|de|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in German, since 1980), author of some 150 articles, and author or editor of many books.

==The Spinelli Group==

On 15 September 2010 Beck supported the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Spinelli Group]] initiative to reinvigorate [[federalism]] in the [[European Union]]. The [[Union of European Federalists]] and its youth organisation [[Young European Federalists]] have been promoting the idea of European federalism for over 60 years, with a "belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalists.eu/uef/history/|title=Union of European Federalists (UEF): History|website=www.federalists.eu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent supporters of the initiative include [[Jacques Delors]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]], [[Andrew Duff]] and [[Elmar Brok]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The [[Sanskrit]] word, '''Vidya''', figures prominently in all texts pertaining to [[Indian philosophy]] - to mean science, learning, knowledge and scholarship; most importantly, it refers to valid knowledge which cannot be contradicted and true knowledge which is the knowledge of the Self intuitively gained. ''Vidya'' is not mere intellectual knowledge, for the [[Vedas]] demand understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=Archibald Edward Gough|publisher=Trubner &amp; Co.|page=48|url= https://archive.org/details/philosophyofupan00gouguoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

'''Vidya''' or ''vidyā'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्या) primarily means science, learning, philosophy, knowledge, scholarship, any knowledge whether true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''Vid'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्) which means - to reason upon, knower, finding, knowing, acquiring or understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=vid+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==

In [[Hindu philosophy]], '' Vidyā'' refers to the knowledge of the soul or spiritual knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=325|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.apte.694114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to the study of the six schools of Hindu philosophy – [[Nyaya]], [[Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Purvamimamsa]] and [[Vedanta|Uttaramimamsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Going to school in South Asia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=75|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LQcBMtetBDkC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of gaining the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] cannot commence unless one has explored the ''Prānavidya'' or ''Agnividya''  to the full in all its numerous phase; through ''vidyā'' or '' [[upasana]] '' to ''[[jnana]] '' was always the eternal order indicated by the Upanishads. ''Jnāna'' dawns after the completion and perfection of the being through the ''vidyās''; then, one crosses over beyond birth and death having already destroyed the bonds of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commentary on the Katha Upanishad (Verses I.1.17/18)|author=Swami Krishnananda|pages=20, 21|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/katha1/Commentary_on_Katha_Upanishad.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

During the [[Vedic]] period, ''Vidyādāna'' or the gift for the sake of education was considered to be the best of gifts, possessing a higher religious efficacy than even the gift of land. ''Vidyā'' comes from the root ''Vid'' ('to know'), it therefore means knowledge, science, learning, lore, scholarship and philosophy. There are basically four ''Vidyas'' – 1) ''Trayi'' (triple) which is the study of the [[Vedas]] and their auxiliary texts, 2) ''[[Anviksiki]]'' which is logic and metaphysics, 3) ''Dandaniti'' which is the science of government, and 4) ''Varum'', the practical arts such as agriculture, commerce, medicine etc. ''Vidyā'' gives insight, in the spiritual sphere it leads to salvation, in the mundane sphere it leads to progress and prosperity. ''Vidyā'' illuminates the mind and shatters illusions, increases intelligence, power and efficiency; develops the intellect and makes it more re-fined; it effects a complete transformation as the root of all happiness and as the source of illumination and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Aryans ti Swaraj|author=S.R.Bakshi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=11 to 15|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ldo1QtQigosC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Vidyā'', does not occur in the [[Rig Veda]], it occurs in the [[Atharvaveda]] and in the [[Brahmana]] portions of the [[Yajurveda]] and in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi Mahatmya|author=Thomas B.Coburn|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=189|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra==

In [[Hinduism]], Goddesses are personifications of the deepest level of power and energy. The concept of [[Shakti]], in its most abstract terms, relates to the energetic principle of Ultimate Reality, the dynamic aspect of the divine. This concept surfaces in the [[Kena Upanishad]] as Goddess Umā bestowing ''Brahma-vidya'' on [[Indra]]; when linked with ''shakti'' and ''maya'', she embodies the power of illusion (''maya''), encompassing ignorance (''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'') and knowledge (''vidyā'') and thereby presented with a dual personality. According to the Saktas, [[Maya (Illusion)|Māyā]] is basically a positive, creative, magical energy of the Goddess that brings forth the universe. The ten ''Mahāvidyās''  are bestowers or personifications of transcendent and liberating religious knowledge; the term ''Vidyā'' in this context refers to power, essence of reality and the ''mantras''. The gentle and motherly forms of Goddess Sri Vidyā are 'right-handed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices|author=Lynn Foulston|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|pages=9,14,115,|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XgwVgPx5G5UC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=sri+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LrbQU5juHcu8ugSUsILoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sri%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the awareness of the 'exterior' ([[Shiva]]) combined with the "I" encompasses the entire space as "I" it is called ''sada-siva-tattva''. When later, discarding the abstraction of the Self and the exterior, clear identification with the insentient space takes place, it is called ''isvara-tattva''; the investigation of these two last steps is pure ''vidyā'' (knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tripura Rahasya|publisher=world Wisdom|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOpi_CkDfKQC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Māyā'', which has been identified with ''[[Prakrti]]'' in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] represents its three ''[[guna]]s''; also identified with ''avidyā'', which term primarily means the dark abyss of non-being and secondarily the mysterious darkness of the unmanifest state, ''Māyā'' binds through ''avidyā'' and releases through ''vidyā'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taittiriya Upanishad (Verse III.2)|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=13|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Taittiriya%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist belief==

In [[Mahayana]] texts, the female divinities are designated grammatically feminine terms ''Dhārāni'' and ''Vidyā''. ''Dharani'' refers to [[mantra]]s, the sounds that carry the essence or energy of a deity, which enable contact with the goddess on her plane of reality because the mantras invoke all deities. ''Vidyā'' is also synonymous with mantra and refers to the mantric invocation of female deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|author=Miranda Eberie Shaw|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet]], the word, ''[[rigpa]]'' , meaning ''vidyā'', refers to the non-dualistic awareness or intrinsic awareness. In [[Theravada Buddhism]], ''vidyā'' means 'non-dual awareness' of [[three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Characteristics of Existence|publisher=Maithri Publications|url= http://www.maithri.com/links/articles/tri_lakshana1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections in a mirror|author=Charlie Singer|publisher=iUniverse|pages=15, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myZdqZhmAwIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Vidyā==

''Agni Vidyā'' or the science of Fire is said to be the greatest discovery of the ancient Indians who gained direct experience of divine fire through continuous research, contemplation, observation and experimentation; their experience led them to discover ways of using this knowledge to heal and nurture the outer and the inner worlds. To them fire is sacred, and because of the pervasive nature of fire all things are sacred. Body and mind which are extensions of the fire that the soul spontaneously emits are also sacred. Within the body the most significant centres of fire are more subtle than those of the sense organs. They are called the ''chakras'' which are seven fields of sacred fire. The understanding of the role of fire without and within gives proper self-understanding which understanding is gained through yogic practices. The performance of [[yajna]]s is the ''karma-kānda'' aspect of ''agni vidyā''. All rituals follow set rules and conditions. The main function of the fire ritual is to make an offering to nature’s finest forces and divinities that fill the space of inner consciousness; fire carries oblations to these forces and divinities. The fire has seven tongues all having unique qualities. The gods, goddesses, divinities and nature’s forces are grouped in seven main categories which match with the qualities of the seven tongues of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Power and Freedom|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|pages=33, 34, 38, 39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph55FuAfQ7AC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pYXQU-agGNeiugS9wILwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atmaikatva==

''Atmaikatva'' or the absolute oneness of the self is the theme of entire [[Advaita Vedanta]] which distinguishes six ''[[pramana]]s'' or means of valid knowledge, but this ''vidyā'' or knowledge of [[Brahman]] is ''guhahita'', ''gahavareshta'' i.e. set in the secret place and hidden in its depth, unattainable except through ''adhyātma-yoga'', the meditation centering upon the nature of the self. Vedanta literature is only preparatory to it, it dispels ignorance and makes the mind receptive but does not reveal the truth therefore it is an indirect means of knowledge. The oneness of the self, which is self-established and self-shining, is called ''vidyā'' in cosmic reference which reveals the true nature of [[Brahman]], the self-shining pure consciousness which is not a ''visaya'' ('object matter or content') but the one subject, transcendent of all conventional subjects and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=S.K.chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=To_QU-SoEYqHuATuiILYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Self or the Atman is to be sought, the Self is to be enquired into, known and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogy Upanishad (Verse VIII.vii.1)|page=446|url= https://archive.org/details/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy of knowledge==

The sage of the [[Mundaka Upanishad]](Verse I.1.4), more in the context of the ritualistic than of epistemological concerns, states that there are two kinds of knowledge (''vidyā'') to be attained, the higher (''para'') and the lower (''apara''). ''[[Para Vidya|Para vidyā]]'', the higher knowledge, is knowledge of the Absolute ([[Brahman]], [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]); ''Apara'', the lower knowledge, is knowledge of the world – of objects, events, means, ends, virtues and vices. ''Para vidyā'' has Reality as its content; ''Apara vidyā'', the phenomenal world. According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Para vidyā'', by the nature of its content, possesses a unique quality of ultimacy that annuls any supposed ultimacy that might be attached to any other or form of knowledge, and is intuitively gained as self-certifying. Once Brahman is realized all other modes of knowledge are seen to be touched by ''avidyā'', the root of ignorance. In this context, ''Vidyā'' means true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Re-construction|author=Eliot Deutsch|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63gdKwhHeV0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is argued that the Advaita Vedanta interpretation does not answer the final question: what is the reality or truth-value of ''avidyā'' or what is the substratum that is the basis or cause of ''avidyā''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita|publisher=SUNY Press|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku2DGm20WWUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valid knowledge==

The Upanishads teach us that the knowledge of difference is ''avidyā'' or ignorance, and the knowledge of identity is true knowledge or ''vidyā'' or valid knowledge, which leads to life eternal. For the [[Cārvāka]]s, perception is the only means of valid knowledge (''pramana''). Vadi Deva Suri of the [[Jainism|Jaina school]] defines valid knowledge as determinate cognition which apprehends itself and an object and which is capable of prompting activity which attains a desirable object or rejects an undesirable object; the result of valid knowledge is cessation of ignorance. [[Vaisheshika]]s recognized four kinds of valid knowledge – Perception, Inference, Recollection and Intuition. The Mimamsa schools introduced the concept of intrinsic validity of knowledge (''svatahpramanya'') and extrinsic validity of knowledge (''parastah-apramana'') but agreed that the validity of knowledge cannot be determined by the knowledge of any special excellence in its cause or the knowledge of its harmony with the real nature of its object or the knowledge of a fruitful action. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] accepted perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption and non-apprehension as the six sources of knowledge and concluded that the knowledge which corresponds with the real nature of its object is valid. The Atman is the reality in the empirical self as the ever present foundational subject-objectless universal consciousness which sustains the empirical self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=16,120,162,319,368|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Outlines_of_Indian_Philosophy.html?id=99aBngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In ''upāsanā'' the movement starts from the outer extremities and gradually penetrates into the inmost recesses of the soul, and the whole investigation is conducted in two spheres, in the subject as well as in the object, in the individual as well as in the world, in the ''aham'' as also in the '' [[idam]] '', in the ''adhyātma'' and also in ''adhidaiva'' spheres and conducted synthetically as well as analytically, through ''apti'' as well as ''samrddhi'', which the [[Bhagavad Gita]] calls '' [[yoga]] '' and '' [[vibhooti]] ''. The ''vidyās'' do not rest content in knowing the reality simply as a whole but proceed further to comprehend it in all its infinite details too. The higher includes the lower grades and adds something more to it and never rejects it; the lower has its fulfilment in the higher and finds its consummation there but never faces extinction. All forms of contemplation have only one aim: to lead to the Supreme Knowledge and hence they are termed as ''vidyās''; through ''vidyā'', which is ''amrta'', one attains immortality ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Verse V.1). ''[[Dahara-vidya|Dahara Vidyā]]'', ''Udgitha Vidyā'' and ''[[Madhu-vidya|Madhu Vidyā]]'' are the synthetic way whereas the analytic way is signified by the Sleeping man of the ''Garga-Ajātsatru'' episode and by the Five Sheaths, which ways show that the world and the individual spring from the same eternal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=171, 175|url= http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Upanishads-Govindagopal-Mukhopadhyaya-Pilgrims-Publishing/12423632861/bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''violet-crowned woodnymph''' (''Thalurania colombica colombica''), also known as the '''purple-crowned woodnymph''', is a medium-sized [[hummingbird]] found from [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]] to northern [[Colombia]] and western [[Venezuela]]. It is now considered by the AOU as the nominate subspecies of the [[crowned woodnymph]].

The violet-crowned woodnymph is a common to abundant bird of wet lowlands and foothills to 2500 m, and may move higher when not breeding. The female violet-crowned woodnymph is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a plant-fibre cup nest 1–5 m high on a horizontal branch. Incubation takes 15–19 days, and fledging another 20-26.

[[File:Violet-crowned Woodnymph (f) JCB.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Female near La Suiza, Costa Rica]]

The adult male violet-crowned woodnymph is 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm long and weighs 4.5 g. It has a violet crown, upper back, shoulders and belly, a shiny green throat and breast, green lower back, and a deeply forked blue-black tail. The female is 8.4–9&amp;nbsp;cm long and weighs 3.5 g. She is bright green above and duller green below, with a grey throat and breast. Her tail is rounded, mainly green near the body but with a blue-black lower half and white corners. Young males lack any violet or [[iridescence]] and are bronze-coloured below. Immature females have buff fringes on the feathers of the nape, face and rump. The call is a high-pitched fast ''kip''.

[[File:Violet-crowned Woodnymph 2496233164.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Male.]] 
The food of this species is [[nectar]], taken from a variety of flowers. Males feed in the canopy, where their food plants include [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[Ericaceae]] and [[bromeliad]]s, and defend flowers and scrubs in their feeding territories. Females stay in the understory. After breeding, both sexes may concentrate at ''[[Heliconia]]s''. Like other hummingbirds, violet-crowned woodnymph also takes small [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s as an essential source of [[protein]].

'''Wonderloch Kellerland''' was an international project and exhibition space founded by [[René Luckhardt]] in his [[Berlin]] apartment in the beginning of 2010. The name relates to Dostoyevsky’s [[Notes from Underground]] (German: “Aufzeichnungen aus dem Kellerloch”) and Lewis Carroll’s [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]. A role model was also [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], the “greatest Kellerloch-artist of all times”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ART Magazine| first=Interview| url=http://www.art-magazin.de/extra/45232/off_spaces_wonderloch_kellerland_berlin_los_angeles|title=Off-Spaces: Wonderloch Kellerland Berlin/Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German magazine ART Das Kunstmagazin refers to Wonderloch Kellerland as the “boot camp of subculture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ART Magazine| first=Interview| url=http://www.art-magazin.de/extra/45232/off_spaces_wonderloch_kellerland_berlin_los_angeles|title=Off-Spaces: Wonderloch Kellerland Berlin/Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Exhibitions included upcoming L.A. and Berlin based artists. But also works by  [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Friedrich Schroder-Sonnenstern]], [[Helga Goetze]], [[Louis Waldon]], [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] or a selection of Viennese artists curated by Stefan Bidner and [[Elke Krystufek]]. Apart from that Wonderloch Kellerland regularly hosted previously unseen curiosities, e.g. handpainted ceramics of the [[French Foreign Legion]] from the [[Adam Saks]] Collection, or a "space clearing" by [[Bettina Sellmann]].

With ARTISTS MERCHANDISING ART Wonderloch Kellerland initiated the first series of international exhibitions to deal with the issue of merchandising in contemporary art. The show featured about 300 artists and was exhibited in Berlin, Paris, Los Angeles, Hamburg and Vienna.
In 2011 a branch of Wonderloch Kellerland opened in Los Angeles, run by Hans-Peter Thomas. Both spaces are included in the Art Spaces Directory of the New Museum New York. Wonderloch Kellerland closed in 2014.

==Project Philosophy==
The philosophy of the project was given as: “As an artist you have to go through rabbit holes or cellar holes (German: Kellerlocher) – like Lewis Carroll’s Alice – in order to get to the Wonderland, to blossom anew and to set free new energies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lützow| first=Gunnar| url=http://www.tip-berlin.de/kultur-und-freizeit-kunst-und-museen/kellerland-im-soldiner-kiez|title=Das Kellerwunder|work=Tip Berlin (14/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
