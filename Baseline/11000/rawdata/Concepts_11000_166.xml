'''Act as 1''' is a [[Domestic Violence]] and [[Family Violence]] Prevention campaign &lt;ref&gt;http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/communityservices/act-as-1&lt;/ref&gt; led by the Queensland Government in Australia. The campaign contains the core message that [[Domestic Violence]] and [[Family Violence]] affects women, men, children, families, neighbours, workplaces and communities and is estimated to cost the Queensland economy $2.7 to $3.2 billion annually.

Act as 1 gathers community support to bring family violence out from behind closed doors. The Act as 1 message is a call to neighbours, friends, family members, colleagues and community members to take a stand against family violence and support those affected.

The campaign points out that we may all know someone who is experiencing family violence and suggests that we could be the "1" to spark a change and make a difference, suggesting that the more who Act as 1, the more powerful the message.

Many community groups support the Government campaign including [[Sunnykids|SunnyKids]] which developed a television campaign raising awareness of family violence and its impact on children in particular. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aws4YYC-hOk%20Act%20As%20One Act as 1 for Kids]

The campaign also identifies 5 ways to "Act as 1"

#Support someone
#Follow the campaign on Facebook  [http://www.facebook.com/actas1?ref=ts&amp;sk=wall Act as 1] and Twitter
#Attend or Hold Events
#Talk about it
#Educate Yourself

Further to activities during Queensland Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Awareness Month (May)the Act as 1 campaign raises awareness about [[elder abuse]] during the month of May. The Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Act in Queensland recognises elder abuse as a form of Domestic and Family Violence.

'''Agonism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀγών ''agon'', "struggle") is a political theory that emphasizes the potentially positive aspects of certain (but not all) forms of political conflict. It accepts a permanent place for such conflict, but seeks to show how people might accept and channel this positively. For this reason, agonists are especially concerned with debates about [[democracy]]. The tradition is also referred to as '''agonistic pluralism'''.

==Agonism and other traditions in political thought==

Agonism is opposed to a strand in the [[Marxist]] conception of politics known as "[[materialism]]". [[Karl Marx|Marx]] would have agreed with the agonists that society had always been full of conflict, when he wrote: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;Marx &amp; Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', 1848, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm Chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the causes of conflict were inescapable features of present—i.e., [[capitalist]]—society. But, in his view, history would develop in such a way as to eventually destroy capitalism, and replace it with a harmonious society—which was his conception of communism. Especially during the 1960s and 1970s, many people, academics included, subscribed to a roughly Marxist analysis. Since then, some of those people have come to the view that the "[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]" does not give sufficient reason for hope about a harmonious society to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Mouffe]] and [[Ernesto Laclau]] are amongst those who have come to agonism from a background in Marxism and the social movements of the middle part of the last century.&lt;ref name="redpepper.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/XRADDEM.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantal Mouffe says, "I use the concept of agonistic pluralism to present a new way to think about democracy that is different from the traditional liberal conception of democracy as a negotiation among interests and is also different from the model that is currently being developed by people like [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. While they have many differences, Rawls and Habermas have in common the idea that the aim of the democratic society is the creation of a consensus, and that consensus is possible if people are only able to leave aside their particular interests and think as rational beings. However, while we desire an end to conflict, if we want people to be free we must always allow for the possibility that conflict may appear and to provide an arena where differences can be confronted. The democratic process should supply that arena."&lt;ref&gt; MOUFFE, C. (2000) The Democratic Paradox. London, New York. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agonism, not antagonism==
Agonism is not simply the undifferentiated celebration of [[wikt:Special:Search/antagonism|antagonism]]:
{{quote|Agonism implies a deep respect and concern for the other; indeed, the Greek ''agon'' refers most directly to an athletic contest oriented not merely toward victory or defeat, but emphasizing the importance of the struggle itself—a struggle that cannot exist without the opponent. Victory through forfeit or default, or over an unworthy opponent, comes up short compared to a defeat at the hands of a worthy opponent—a defeat that still brings honor. An agonistic discourse will therefore be one marked not merely by conflict but just as importantly, by mutual admiration...|Political theorist [[Samuel Chambers]]&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"&gt;[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=317]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Bonnie Honig]], an advocate of agonism, writes: "to affirm the perpetuity of the contest is not to celebrate a world without points of stabilisation; it is to affirm the reality of perpetual contest, even within an ordered setting, and to identify the affirmative dimension of contestation".&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Political Theory and the Displacement of Politics'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical conceptions==
The work of [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have also invoked conceptions of agonism and the agon in a more critical sense beyond that of political counter-hegemony. Although this usage of Agonism has been largely ignored it has been explored at some length by Claudio Colaguori in ''Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination''. For Colaguori, "the agon is literally the arena of competition, the scene of contest, and the locus of adversarial conflict. The philosophy of agonism affirms the idea that transcendence, truth, and growth are generated from the outcome of the contest...the concept of agonism is often understood in an affirmative sense as the generative principle of economy, society and even natural ecology and personal growth... The ambivalent character of agonism is that it is often seen as a mode of transcendence, while its instrumental relation to the mode of destruction is rarely acknowledged".&lt;ref&gt;"C Colaguori" Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination. de Sitter Publications, Whitby, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-897160-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agonism forms part of the instituted social order where society "produces and reproduces itself precisely from the interconnection of the antagonistic interests of its members" (Adorno, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Adorno, 1974, "Minima Moralia". London: Verso Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno, agonism is also about the "[[theodicy]] of conflict" where opponents "want to annihilate one another... to enter the agon, each the mortal enemy of each" (Minima Moralia). Adorno also sees agonism as the underlying principle in [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic of history]] where "dialectics (growth through conflict) is the [[ontology]] of the wrong state of things. The right state of things would be free of it: neither a system nor a contradiction" (Negative Dialectics). Colaguori reconstructs the concept of the agon to invoke this critical, destructive aspect as a way of extending Adorno's critique of modern domination and identify how the normalization and naturalization of conflict is used as an ideology to justify various forms of domination and subjugation. The agonistic ideology that has been appropriated by popular culture for example makes use of agonistic themes to celebrate competition as the wellspring of life in such a way as to normalize "a military definition of reality" (C. W. Mills).

The critical conception of agonism developed by Adorno and Foucault emphasizes how aspects of competition can be utilized to reinforce the project of domination that is evident in the geopolitics of modernity. Colaguori suggests that a critical conception of agonism can be applied to the study of "numerous forms of social conflict in gender, class and race relations where the competitive mode of interaction prevails in the formation of social hierarchies based on competition as a form of exclusion". Colaguori further states that, "after 100 years of technological progress, human societies are trapped in a perpetual dynamic of conflict and crisis, with modernization at a standstill. While this dialectic of development and destruction has been analysed from political and economic perspectives, Agon Culture offers an analysis of the human condition through an examination of the way in which the cultural ideology of competition operates as a mode of rationality that underpins the order of domination."

==Agonism in fiction==
The [[science fiction]] novel ''Lady of Mazes'' by [[Karl Schroeder]] depicts a post-human future where "agonistics" is the ruling principle of the solar system. The story explains agonistics as "You can compete, and you can win, but you can never win once-and-for-all". A character gives two examples of agonism: a presidency with [[term limit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and laws aimed at preventing corporate monopolies.&lt;ref name= "KSchroeder"&gt;Karl Schroeder ''Lady of Mazes'', Tor, {{ISBN|0-7653-1219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''algebraic interior''' or '''radial kernel''' of a subset of a [[vector space]] is a refinement of the concept of the [[Interior (topology)|interior]].  It is the subset of points contained in a given set with respect to which it is [[absorbing set|absorbing]], i.e. the [[radial set|radial]] points of the set.&lt;ref name="coherent"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coherent Risk Measures, Valuation Bounds, and (&lt;math&gt;\mu,\rho&lt;/math&gt;)-Portfolio Optimization|first1=Stefan|last1=Jaschke|first2=Uwe|last2=Kuchler|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements of the algebraic interior are often referred to as '''internal points'''.&lt;ref name="aliprantis+border"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aliprantis|first=C.D.|last2=Border|first2=K.C.|title=Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|date=2007|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|doi=10.1007/3-540-29587-9|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndcook.com/SeparationOfConvexSets.pdf | accessdate=November 14, 2012 |format=pdf |title=Separation of Convex Sets in Linear Topological Spaces |author=John Cook |date=May 21, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear space]] then the algebraic interior of &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) := \left\{x_0 \in A: \forall x \in X, \exists t_x &gt; 0, \forall t \in [0,t_x], x_0 + tx \in A\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikolaĭ Kapitonovich Nikolʹskiĭ|title=Functional analysis I: linear functional analysis|date=1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-50584-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in general &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) \neq \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;, but if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]] then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) = \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set then if &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \operatorname{core}(A), y \in A, 0 &lt; \lambda \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\lambda x_0 + (1 - \lambda)y \in \operatorname{core}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==
If &lt;math&gt;A = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2: x_2 \geq x_1^2 \text{ or } x_2 \leq 0\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0 \in \operatorname{core}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0 \not\in \operatorname{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \not\in \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A,B \subset X&lt;/math&gt; then:

=== Relation to interior ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological vector space]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}&lt;/math&gt; denote the interior operator, and &lt;math&gt;A \subset X&lt;/math&gt; then:

* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty convex and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}A = \operatorname{core}A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="aliprantis+border" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Amende honorable''' was originally a mode of punishment in France which required the offender, barefoot and stripped to his shirt, and led into a church or auditory with a torch in his hand and a rope round his neck held by the public executioner, to beg pardon on his knees of his God, his king, and his country; now used to denote a satisfactory apology or reparation.&lt;ref name="Nut"&gt;{{Nuttall|inline=1|title=Amende honorable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amende honorable forbade revenge.

The ''amende honorable'' was sometimes incorporated into a larger ritual of [[capital punishment]] (specifically the [[hanging, drawing and quartering#French "quartering"|French version of drawing and quartering]]) for [[parricide]]s and [[regicide]]s; this is described in the 1975 book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]], notably in reference to [[Robert-François Damiens]] who was condemned to make the ''amende honorable'' before the main door of the Church of Paris in 1757.

The positive aspects, or approach portion, of marriage might be considered togetherness, sharing memories, and companionship while the negative aspects, or avoidance portions, might include financial considerations, arguments, and difficulty with in-laws. The negative effects of the decision help influence the decision maker to avoid the goal or event, while the positive effects influence the decision maker to want to approach or proceed with the goal or event. The influence of the negative and positive aspects create a conflict because the decision maker has to either proceed toward the goal or avoid the goal altogether. For example, the decision maker might approach proposing to a partner with excitement because of the positive aspects of marriage. On the other hand, he or she might avoid proposing due to the negative aspects of marriage.

The decision maker might initiate approach toward the goal, but as awareness of the negative factors increases, the desire to avoid the goal may arise, producing indecision. If there are competing feelings to a goal, the stronger of the two will triumph. For instance, if a person was thinking of starting a business they would be faced with positive and negative aspects. Before actually starting the business, the person would be excited about the prospects of success for the new business and they would encounter (approach) the positive aspects first: they would attract investors, create interest in their upcoming ideas and it would be a new challenge. However, as they drew closer to actually launching the business, the negative aspects would become more apparent; the person would acknowledge that it would require much effort, time, and energy from other aspects of their life. The increase in strength of these negative aspects (avoidance) would cause them to avoid the conflict or goal of starting the new business, which might result in indecision. Research pertaining to approach and avoidance conflicts has been extended into implicit [[Motivation|motive]]s, both abstract and social in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Boyd, R.L.|author2=Robinson, M.

'''AutoTrack''' is a vehicle [[swept path analysis]] software program used for analysing the movements of steered and wheeled vehicles including [[Automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, [[trams]], [[aircraft]] and other more specialist vehicles such as [[fork lift]] trucks, [[wheelchairs]] and access platforms. AutoTrack was the world's first [[swept path analysis]] software program, originally being jointly developed by TRL&lt;ref&gt;The [[Transport Research Laboratory]] [http://www.trl.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; (the UK's [[Transport Research Laboratory]]) and British engineering consultants, Travers Morgan (acquired by Symonds in 1995 who are now part of Capita Symonds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/about_us/an_overview/our_history.aspx Capita Symonds company history]&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of TRACK. The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicle's simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, [[chassis]] and [[steering]] specification. AutoTrack has many similarities and performs the same function as the alternative swept path analysis program [[AutoTURN]], which is developed by Transoft Solutions, Inc..

AutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of [[highways]], [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s, [[buildings]] and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and [[geometry]] required to manoeuvre specified design [[vehicles]]. A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, rather being indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.

The AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the [[Road]], [[Rail transport|Rail]] and [[Airports]] industries and operates within several different [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems such as [[AutoCAD]] by [[Autodesk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[AutoCAD]] product page on the [[Autodesk]] website [http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microstation]] by [[Bentley Systems]],&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Microstation]] [http://communities.bentley.com/products/microstation/w/microstation__wiki/history-of-microstation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bricscad]] by Bricsys&lt;ref&gt;Bricsys company website (developer of [[Bricscad]] [http://www.bricsys.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (a former member of the [[IntelliCAD Technology Consortium]]) and standalone in [[Microsoft Windows]]. When the software was first developed it initially ran as a [[DOS]]-based application and when it was ported to operate within [[AutoCAD]], it was given the name AutoTrack. The software, initially developed for consulting purposes, was sold commercially and following the demise of the original company, a management buy out pre-empted the incorporation of Savoy Computing Services Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoycomputing.com Savoy Computing company website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110041309/http://www.savoycomputing.com/ |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996. Two of the surviving directors of Savoy Computing were involved with the original development of TRACK.

In August, 2013 [[Autodesk]] acquired the technology assets of Savoy Computing Services Ltd, including the AutoTrack technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-expands-infrastructure-design-and-analysis-portfolio Autodesk expands Infrastructure portfolio]&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk subsequently released Autodesk Vehicle Tracking, which directly superseded AutoTrack in November, 2013. At this point Savoy Computing Services ceased trading and the AutoTrack software product is since no longer supported.

'''Behaviorism''' (or '''behaviourism''') is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that all behaviors are either [[reflex]]es produced by a response to certain stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli.  Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors.
 
Behaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to [[depth psychology]] and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 19th century where [[Edward Thorndike]] pioneered the [[law of effect]], a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of [[reinforcement]].

During the first half of the twentieth century, [[John B. Watson]] devised [[methodological behaviorism]], which rejected [[introspection|introspective methods]] and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that [[B. F. Skinner]] suggested that private events—including thoughts and feelings—should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called "[[radical behaviorism]]."&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|title=Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science|author=Chiesa, Mecca|publisher=Authors Cooperative, Inc.|isbn=0962331147|pages=1–241|date=1994|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904195958/http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|archive-date=2017-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13668250902845244|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: Dispelling the myths|author1=Dillenburger, Karola|author2=Keenan, Mickey|lastauthoramp=yes|journal=Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–195|date=2009|accessdate=2014-12-24|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Watson and [[Ivan Pavlov]] investigated the stimulus-response procedures of [[classical conditioning]], Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its potential effect on the [[Stimulus control|antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that strengthens behavior]]; the technique became known as [[operant conditioning]].

Skinner's radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner’s dismissal of theory limited its development.  Theoretical behaviorism&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014) The New Behaviorism (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.  &lt;/ref&gt; recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses.  Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called “latent” responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. Theoretical behaviorism. Philosophy and Behavior. (45) in press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select.  

The application of radical behaviorism—known as [[applied behavior analysis]]—is used in a variety of settings, including, for example, [[organizational behavior management]], to the treatment of mental disorders, such as [[autism]] and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=JABA1968&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1310980|title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|author1=Baer, Donald M.|author2=Wolf, Montrose M.|author3=Risley, Todd R.|work=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=1|issue=1|date=1968|pmid=16795165|pages=91–7|doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-Handbook-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4311509.aspx|title=APA Handbook of Behavior Analysis|editor=Madden, Gregory J.|date=2013|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bar/index.aspx?tab=1|title=Behavior Analysis: Research and Practice|editor=Crone-Todd, Darlene|date=2015|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while behaviorism and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] schools of psychological thought may not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavior therapies]], which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple [[phobia]]s, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], and [[mood disorders]].

==Varieties&lt;!--'Methodological behaviorism' redirects here--&gt;==
There is no universally agreed-upon classification, but some titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:
* '''Methodological behaviorism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: [[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s behaviorism states that only public events (behaviors of an individual) can be objectively observed, and that therefore private events (thoughts and feelings) should be ignored.&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skinner1976&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=BF |title=About Behaviorism |year=1976 |publisher=Random House, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-394-71618-3 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/About_Behaviorism.html?id=K7WKkwPzNqsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; It also became the basis for the early approach [[behavior modification]] in the 1970s and early 1980s.
* [[Radical behaviorism]]: [[B. F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism theorizes that processes within the organism should be acknowledged, particularly the presence of private events (such as thoughts and feelings), and suggests that environmental variables also control these internal events just as they control observable behaviors. Radical behaviorism forms the core philosophy behind [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used many of radical behaviorism's ideas in his study of knowledge and language.&lt;ref name=Skinner1976/&gt;
* [[Teleological behaviorism]]: Post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to [[microeconomics]]. Focuses on objective observation as opposed to cognitive processes.
* [[Psychological behaviorism]]: As proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]], unlike the previous behaviorisms of Skinner, Hull, and Tolman, was based upon a program of human research involving various types of human behavior. Psychological behaviorism introduces new principles of human learning. Humans learn not only by the animal learning principles but also by special human learning principles. Those principles involve human's uniquely huge learning ability. Humans learn repertoires that enable them to learn other things. Human learning is thus cumulative. No other animal demonstrates that ability, making the human species unique.
* [[Interbehaviorism]]: Founded by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] before Skinner's writings.

Two subtypes are:
* [[Clark L. Hull|Hullian]] and post-Hullian: theoretical, group data, not dynamic, physiological
* Purposive: [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s behavioristic anticipation of cognitive psychology

===Radical behaviorism===
{{main article|Radical behaviorism}}
B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. This view differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions such as American pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moxley |first=R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism: The philosophy of behavior analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=108–25 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental and conceptual innovations==
This essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books ''The Behavior of Organisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner |first=B.F. |authorlink= B.F. Skinner |title=[[The Behavior of Organisms]] |publisher=Copley Pub Group |year=1991 |page=473 |isbn=0-87411-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cheney, Carl D. |author2=Ferster, Charles B. |title=Schedules of Reinforcement (B.F. Skinner Reprint Series) |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |location=Acton, MA |year=1997 |page=758 |isbn=0-87411-828-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and [[S–R theory]].

Skinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on [[trial-and-error]] learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus–response "association" or "connection" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the "free operant", so called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers', a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work ''Are Theories of Learning Necessary?'' in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |year=2001 |title=A short history of the Society for the Quantitative Analysis of Behavior |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=275–9 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thornbury |first1= Scott|title=The Lexical Approach: A journey without maps|journal=Modern English Teacher|date=1998|volume=7 | issue = 4 |pages= 7–13| url= http://nebula.wsimg.com/9129eed8a13130f4ee92cf2c3ce5b13e?AccessKeyId=186A535D1BA4FC995A73&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to language==
As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |location=Acton, Massachusetts |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn= 1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other language-related publications;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B.F. |year=1969 |title=An operant analysis of problem-solving |pages=133–57}}; chapter in {{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbal Behavior'' laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issue=1 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm |year=1959 |pages=26–58 |author1=Chomsky, Noam |authorlink1=Noam Chomsky |doi=10.2307/411334 |volume=35 |jstor=411334 |author2=Skinner, B.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia M.|year=2013 |title= Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher= SAGE Publications| isbn= 9781483315324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |title=I Have Been Misunderstood. |journal=Center Magazine |year=1972 |issue= March–April |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed.&lt;ref name=MacCorquodale1970&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacCorquodale |first=K. |year=1970 |title=On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's VERBAL BEHAVIOR |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=83–99 |url=https://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83 |pmc=1333660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061500/http://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |archive-date=2009-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2103585"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stemmer| first= N. |title=Skinner's verbal behavior, Chomsky's review, and mentalism |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=307–15 |year=1990 |pmid=2103585 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.54-307 |pmc=1323000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innateness hypothesis|Innateness theory]] is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Thornbury| first1= Scott| title= An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan|location=Oxford|isbn=1405070633|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas Brown |first1= H| title= Principles of Language Learning and Teaching|date=2000|publisher=Longman/Pearson Education|location=White Plains |isbn= 0-13-017816-0| pages= 8–9| edition= Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not [[language acquisition]] so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book ''Contingencies of Reinforcement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such "instructional control" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of [[relational frame theory]].

==Education==
{{see also|Philosophy of education#Realism}}
Behaviourism focuses on one particular view of learning: a change in external behaviour achieved through using reinforcement and repetition ([[Rote learning]]) to shape behavior of learners. Skinner found that behaviors could be shaped when the use of reinforcement was implemented. Desired behavior is rewarded, while the undesired behavior is not rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/behaviorism.html|title=Behaviorism - Learning Theories|date=2007-01-31|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating behaviorism into the classroom allowed educators to assist their students in excelling both academically and personally. In the field of language learning, this type of teaching was called the [[audio-lingual method]], characterised by the whole class using choral chanting of key phrases, dialogues and immediate correction.

Within the behaviourist view of learning, the "teacher" is the dominant person in the classroom and takes complete control, evaluation of learning comes from the teacher who decides what is right or wrong. The learner does not have any opportunity for evaluation or reflection within the learning process, they are simply told what is right or wrong.
The conceptualization of learning using this approach could be considered "superficial" as the focus is on external changes in behaviour i.e. not interested in the internal processes of learning leading to behaviour change and has no place for the emotions involved the process.

==Operant conditioning==
{{main article|Operant conditioning}}
[[Operant conditioning]] was developed by [[B.F. Skinner]] in 1937 and deals with the [[behaviour modification|modification of "voluntary behaviour"]] or operant behaviour. Operant behavior operates on the environment and is maintained by its consequences. [[Reinforcement]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], the core tools of operant conditioning, are either positive (delivered following a response), or negative (withdrawn following a response).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/operant-conditioning-skinner.html|title=Classical and Operant Conditioning - Behaviorist Theories|date=2015-06-19|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner created the ''Skinner Box'' or [[operant conditioning chamber]] to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats. From this study, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently. Skinner also found that he could shape the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

==Classical conditioning==
{{main article|Classical conditioning}}
Although [[operant conditioning]] plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, [[classical conditioning]] (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure.  In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth.  After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Pavlov|url=http://www.ivanpavlov.com/|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.

[[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s "Behaviourist Manifesto" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the "science of behaviour"; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states; the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{main|Logical behaviorism}}
Behaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with [[philosophy of mind]]. The basic premise of ''radical behaviorism'' is that the study of behavior should be a [[natural science]], such as [[chemistry]] or [[physics]], without any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior. Less radical varieties are unconcerned with philosophical positions on internal, mental and subjective experience. Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to [[Edmund Fantino]] and colleagues: "Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach."&lt;ref name=Fantino2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |author2=Stolarz-Fantino, S. |author3=Navarro, A.  |year=2003 |title=Logical fallacies: A behavioral approach to reasoning |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/4/1/109.html |accessdate=2008-01-10 |at=p.116 (pp.109–117)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within [[philosophy of language]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. It is sometimes argued that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] defended a [[Logical behaviorism|logical behaviorist]] position&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=behaviorism |title=Behaviorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the ''[[Philosophical Investigations#Wittgenstein's beetle|beetle in a box]]'' argument). In [[logical positivism]] (as held, e.g., by [[Rudolf Carnap]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Carl Hempel]]),&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. [[W. V. O. Quine]] made use of a type of behaviorism,&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Quine's work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. [[Gilbert Ryle]] defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented "[[category mistake]]s", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. [[Daniel Dennett]] likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist,&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm |title=The Message is: There is no Medium |last=Dennett |first=D.C. |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Tufts University| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111100055/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Dennett |year=1981 |title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-54037-7 |lccn=78013723 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC&amp;pg=PA53 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|This is Dennett's main point in "Skinner Skinned." Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away… If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now have a better understanding of what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like [[Joseph Weizenbaum|Weizenbaum's]] [[ELIZA]] program, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.)|Curtis Brown|Philosophy of Mind|"Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett |year=2001 |work=Philosophy of Mind |first=Curtis |last=Brown |publisher=Trinity University |location=San Antonio, TX |url=http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/mind/behaviorism.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
===Molecular versus molar behaviorism===
Skinner's view of behavior is most often characterized as a "molecular" view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article "Selection by Consequences".&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=31 July 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–4 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2010 |pmid=7244649 |bibcode=1981Sci...213..501S |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230825/http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: [[biology]] (the [[natural selection]] or [[phylogeny]] of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, [[culture]] (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from [[melioration theory]], [[hyperbolic discounting|negative power function discounting]] or additive versions of negative power function discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |title=Delay-reduction theory—the case for temporal context: comment on Grace and Savastano (2000) |journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=444–6 |year=2000 |pmid=11142857 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.4.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molar behaviorists, such as [[Howard Rachlin]], [[Richard Herrnstein]], and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as "associative strength", are better replaced by molar variables such as [[rate of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baum, W.M. |year=2003 |title=The molar view of behavior and its usefulness in behavior analysis |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |pages=78–81 |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1037/h0100009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904101644/http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |archive-date=2009-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe "loving someone" as a pattern of [[love|loving behavior]] over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as "love".

===21st-century behavior analysis===
{{Advert|section|date=March 2015}}
The early term [[behavior modification]] has been obsolete since the 1990s as it currently refers to the brief revival of methodological behaviorism in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=JABA1994&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1297814|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|author=Mace, F.

The independent development of behaviour analysis outside the US also continues to develop, In terms of motivation, there remains strong interest in the variety of human motivational behaviour factors, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellaway|first1=Lucy|title=My team gets more excited by loo roll than business budgets: Work problems answered|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a06bab2a-8ab7-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=7 January 2015|location=London|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eyres|first1=Harry|title=Peaks in a trough year: The Slow Lane|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DPeaks%2Bin%2Ba%2Btrough%2BEYRES&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 December 2009|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Stefan|title=Keep up motivation levels through long summer days|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=5 August 2008|location=London|page=12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122232423/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|archive-date=2015-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skapinker|first1=Michael|title=Human capitalism: Does treating workers well help business too?

The interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within ABAI indicates. Such interests include everything from developmental disabilities and autism, to cultural psychology, clinical psychology, verbal behavior, [[Organizational Behavior Management]] (OBM; behavior analytic I–O psychology). OBM has developed a particularly strong following within behavior analysis, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and the influential ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM; recently rated the 3rd highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating).

Applications of behavioral technology, also known as applied behavior analysis or ABA, have been particularly well established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s.  Treatment of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders has grown especially rapidly since the mid-1990s.  This demand for services encouraged the formation of a professional credentialing program administered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. (BACB) and accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies.  As of early 2012, there are over 300 BACB approved course sequences offered by about 200 colleges and universities worldwide preparing students for this credential and approximately 11,000 BACB certificants, most working in the United States.  The Association of Professional Behavior Analysts was formed in 2008 to meet the needs of these ABA professionals.

Modern [[behavior analysis]] has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research and applications related to language and cognition, with the development of [[relational frame theory]] (RFT; described as a "Post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition").&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (2001) Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition. Kluwer Academic: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; RFT also forms the empirical basis for the highly successful and data-driven [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT). In fact, researchers and practitioners in RFT/ACT have become sufficiently prominent that they have formed their own specialized organization that is highly behaviorally oriented, known as the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] (ACBS). 

Some of the current prominent behavior analytic journals include the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'' (JABA), the ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' (JEAB) JEAB website, the ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM), ''Behavior and Social Issues'' (BSI), as well as ''[[the Psychological Record]]''. Currently, the US has 14 ABAI accredited MA and PhD programs for comprehensive study in behavior analysis.

==Behavior analysis and culture==
Cultural analysis has always been at the philosophical core of radical behaviorism from the early days (as seen in Skinner's ''[[Walden Two]]'', ''Science &amp; Human Behavior'', ''Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity'', and ''About Behaviorism'').

During the 1980s, behavior analysts, most notably Sigrid Glenn, had a productive interchange with cultural anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]] (the most notable proponent of "cultural materialism") regarding interdisciplinary work. Very recently, behavior analysts have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Todd A. |last2=Eastman |first2= Raymond |last3=Ninness |first3=Chris |year=2009 |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/1950/2185 |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorism is also frequently used in [[game development]], although this application is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gamification, Behaviorism and Bullsh$!|author=Jon Radoff|year=2011|journal=Radoff.com|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|access-date=2011-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003003247/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|archive-date=2011-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior informatics and behavior computing ==
With the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. [[Behavior informatics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|date=|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|url=|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.03.025|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Joachims|first2=Thorsten|date=|year=2014|title=Behavior Informatics: A New Perspective.|url=|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=29|issue=4|pages=62–80|doi=10.1109/mis.2014.60|pmid=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[behavior computing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior Computing: Modeling, Analysis, Mining and Decision|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Yu|first2=Philip (eds)|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4471-2969-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior and Social Computing|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Motoda|first2=Hiroshi|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-3-319-04047-9|location=|pages=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

== Criticisms and limitations ==
{{See also|Cognitive psychology|Cognitive neuroscience}}
In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the [[cognitive revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, N. (2005). Mind and Machine: Ethical and Epistemological Implications for Research. Thompson Rivers University, B.C., Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldrop, M.M. (2002). ''The Dream Machine: JCR Licklider and the revolution that made computing personal''. New York: Penguin Books. (pp. 139–40).&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the [[cognitive therapy]] movement.
In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 26–58 | doi = 10.2307/411334 }}
Chomsky N. Preface to the reprint of A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. In: Jakobovits L.A, Miron M.S, editors. Readings in the psychology of language. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought. [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. The effective result was more of a framework conceptualization of mental functions with their counterparts in computers (memory, storage, retrieval, etc.)
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandler|first=George|title=Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution|year=2002|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=38|pages=339–353|doi=10.1002/jhbs.10066|pmid=12404267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

'''''Belgitude''''' is a term used to express the [[Belgium|Belgian]] soul and identity.

==Context==

Contrary to most other countries [[Belgians]] have a mixed feeling towards their identity as one people. This is a result of being occupied by many foreign European powers throughout the centuries, which led to an [[inferiority complex]] about their status and power in the world. The regions were conquered by [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carolingian Empire|French]], [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgondia]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire|Austria-Hungary]], [[Napoleonic Empire|the French again]] and finally [[The Netherlands]] before becoming independent in [[1830]]. And even then they were occupied again by [[Germany|the Germans]] during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. Another aspect contributing to ''belgitude'' is the fact that many Belgians identify more with being [[Flanders|Flemish]], [[Wallonia|Walloon]] or part of [[Brussels]], but even within those groups many feel more attached to being part of a city or province than any national or community identity. There have been countless issues between the Flemish and Walloon [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]] throughout Belgian history that often lead to intense political discussions and crisises in Belgian parliament.

The Belgian identity is seen as a "hollow" identity: it is defined mostly by what it is not. For example, the Belgian is neither [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[German people|German]]. At the time of the term's coinage, it was not accepted by the general population, and the term seemed to have "more cultural than political weight". At the time, belgitude could be synonymous with [[Marginalization|marginality]].&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; [[Susan Bainbrigge]] defines it as  "a term  that represents [the] new approach to [[francophone]] [[Belgium]] specificity [that emerged] in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge&gt;{{cite book|last=Bainbrigge|first=Susan|title=Culture and identity in Belgian francophone writing: dialogue, diversity and displacement|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXY9keniD1UC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Belgitude&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yAvdTrHYKefnmAXS15XCCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Belgitude&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the extent of the questioning identity of Belgians with the sense of self-mockery that characterizes them.

==History of the Belgian feeling of identity==

During his conquest of [[Gaul]] in 54 before Christ [[Julius Caesar]] wrote in his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] about the three Celtic tribes that inhabited the country, namely the ''[[Aquitani]]'' in the southwest, the ''[[Gauls]]'' of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called ''Celtae'', and the ''[[Belgae]]'' in the north. Caesar famously wrote that the [[Belgae]] were ''"the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the [[Rhine]], with whom they are continually at war"''.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Conquest of Gaul Gallico'', trans. S. A. Handford, revised with a new introduction by Jane F. Gardner (Penguin Books 1982), I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Caesar referring to the Celtic tribe the Belgae and not modern day Belgium the quote was used a lot in Belgian history books from the 1830s on while the new independent state searched for its own identity.

The most famous quote about the Belgian identity was said by the Walloon socialist politician [[Jules Destrée]]. According to Destrée, Belgium was composed of two separate entities, [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], and a feeling of [[Belgian nationalism]] was not possible, illustrated in his 1906 work "Une idée qui meurt: la patrie" (''An idea that is dying: the fatherland''). In the "Revue de Belgique" of 15 August 1912 he articulated this in his famous and notorious "Lettre au roi sur la séparation de la Wallonie et de la Flandre" (''Letter to the king on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders''), where he wrote: {{quote|Il y a en Belgique des Wallons et des Flamands. Il n'y a pas de Belges.&lt;br&gt;''In Belgium there are [[Walloons]] and [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s. There are no [[Belgian]]s.''}} Contrary to later interpretations Destrée didn't favor separatism, but wanted a move to a [[federal state]]. King [[Albert I of Belgium]] wrote an official answer to the letter, which read:  ''I read the letter of Destrée, which, without uncertainty, is some literature of great talent. All that he said is absolutely true, but it is not less true that administrative separation would be an evil with more disadvantages and dangers than any aspect of the current situation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} J'ai lu la lettre de Destrée qui, sans conteste, est un littérateur de grand talent. Tout ce qu'il dit est absolument vrai, mais il est non moins vrai que la séparation administrative serait un mal entraînant plus d'inconvénients et de dangers de tout genre que la situation actuelle. Landro, 30 août, ''A Jules Ingebleek, secrétaire  privé du Roi et de la Reine'', lettre reproduite in extenso in M-R Thielemans et E. Vandewoude, ''Le Roi Albert au travers de ses lettres inédites'', Office international de librairie, Bruxelles, 1982, pp. 435-436.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 Flemish politician [[Gaston Eyskens]] modified this quote, saying "Sire, il n'y a plus de Belges" (''Sire, there are no more Belgians''), after the first steps were taken to transform Belgium into a [[federal state]].

==Etymology==

The [[neologism]] "belgitude" was coined in 1976, by [[Pierre Mertens]] and Claude Jevaeu in as issue of the ''Nouvelles littéraires'' called "L'autre Belgique".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; It alludes to the term ''[[négritude]]'' about feeling black, expressed by [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]]. The term caught on quick enough to be referred to in Belgian singer [[Jacques Brel]]'s song "Mai 1940" ("May 1940"), which was left off his final album ''[[Les Marquises]]'' in 1977, but made available in 2003. In the song Brel refers to German soldiers who occupied Belgium during [[World War Two]] and wiped out his belgitude:

''D'un ciel plus bleu qua'à l'habitude'',            ''(Translation: "From a heaven bluer than usual")''
 
''Ce mai 40 a salué''                                ''(Translation: "That May 1940 greeted")''
 
''Quelques Allemands disciplinés''                   ''(Translation: "Several disciplined Germans")''
 
''Qui écrasaient ma belgitude,''                   ''(Translation: "Who wiped out my belgitude".)'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003200301_01/_ons003200301_01_0174.php|title=Ons Erfdeel. Jaargang 46 · dbnl|first=|last=DBNL|website=DBNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the word "Belgitude" was listed in the French encyclopedia, the [[Petit Larousse]]'' &lt;ref&gt;« « Belgitude » dans le Petit Larousse illustré » dans [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/1284233/2011/06/27/Belgitude-dans-le-Petit-Larousse-illustre.dhtml 7sur7.be], 27 juin 2011, consulté le 28 juin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of belgitudes==

Belgitude is characterised by things that are unique to Belgian culture, such as [[Belgian Dutch]] and [[Belgian French]]. The Dutch in Belgium has many [[gallicism]]s and the French in Belgium many [[hollandism]]s, both in terms of words as well as grammar. The word "bourgemestre" ([[mayor]]) in Wallonia, for instance, is clearly inspired by the Dutch word "burgemeester" and differs considerably from the commonly accepted French word "maire". The word "plezant" ("amusing") in [[Flanders]] is a derivation of the French word "plaisant" and is hardly used in [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsetaal.be/artikel/171/franse-invloed|title=VlaamseTaal.be - Franse invloed|website=www.vlaamsetaal.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical foods and drinks, such as [[Belgian beer]], [[moules frites]], [[speculaas]], [[waterzooi]], [[witloof]], [[Brussels sprouts]], [[Belgian chocolate]],... are also seen as examples of belgitude, because they are often promoted abroad. People who were important to Belgian history are also often cited: [[Ambiorix]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Charles V of Spain]], [[Adolphe Sax]], [[Baudouin of Belgium]], as are cultural icons such as [[Manneken Pis]], the [[Carnival of Binche|Gilles of Binche]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Inspector Maigret]], the [[Atomium]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[René Magritte]], [[Soeur Sourire]], [[Django Reinhardt]],... In the fields of sport [[Eddy Merckx]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Red Devils]] are a good example. The song ''"[[Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)]]" (1998)'' by [[John Makin|Mr. John]] is also an expression of belgitude. The satirical comedy and film adaptation ''[[Sois Belge et tais-toi]]'', the films of [[Jan Bucquoy]] and the comedy team [[Les Snuls]] are all loving and mocking tributes to the Belgian identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11595">'''Body transfer illusion''' is the [[illusion]] of owning either a part of a body or an entire body other than one's own, thus it is sometimes referred to as "body ownership" in the research literature. It can be induced experimentally by manipulating the [[visual perspective]] of the subject and also supplying visual and sensory signals which correlate to the subject's body.&lt;ref&gt;Petkova VI, Ehrsson HH, 2008 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003832 If I Were You: Perceptual Illusion of Body Swapping]. [[PLoS ONE]] 3(12): e3832. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0003832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. P.M. Kammers, I.J.M. van der Ham, H.C. Dijkerman, "Dissociating body representations in healthy individuals: Differential effects of a kinaesthetic illusion on perception and action", [[Neuropsychologia]], Volume 44, Issue 12, 2006, Pages 2430–2436, ISSN 0028-3932, {{doi|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For it to occur, [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] perceptual mechanisms, such as the input of visual information, must override [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] knowledge that the certain body (or part) does not belong. This is what results in an illusion of transfer of body ownership.&lt;ref name="slater2010"&gt;Slater M, Spanlang B, Sanchez-Vives MV, Blanke O, 2010 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010564 First Person Experience of Body Transfer in Virtual Reality]. PLoS ONE 5(5): e10564. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0010564}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically induced using [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref name="slater2010" /&gt;

==Rubber hand illusion==
Ehrsson, Spence, and [[Richard Passingham|Passingham]] (2004) did studies on the "rubber hand illusion". Subjects with normal brain function were positioned with their left hand hidden out of sight. They saw a lifelike rubber left hand in front of them. The experimenters stroked both the subjects hidden left hand and the visible rubber hand with a paintbrush. The experiment showed that if the two hands were stroked synchronously and in the same direction, the subjects began to experience the rubber hand as their own. When asked to use their right hand to point to their left hand, most of the time they pointed toward the rubber hand. If the real and rubber hands were stroked in different directions or at different times, the subjects did not experience the rubber hand as their own.

While the experiment was going on the experimenters also recorded the activity of their brains with a functional MRI scanner. The scans showed increased activity in the parietal lobe and then, right after, as the subjects began to experience the rubber hand as their own, in the [[premotor cortex]], the region of the brain involved in planning movements. On the other hand, when the stroking of the real and rubber hands was uncoordinated and the subjects did not experience the rubber hand as their own, the premotor cortex did not become activated. From this the experimenters concluded that the parietal cortex was involved with visual and touch processing. The premotor cortex, getting transmitted information from the parietal cortex, was involved with the feeling of ownership of the rubber hand.

Another study from the same laboratory provided further evidence of this ownership of the rubber hand (Ehrsson et al., 2007; Slater et al., 2009). The experimenters used the same procedure as the previous experiment to establish that feeling of ownership involved with the stimulation of the premotor cortex. Then, threatened the rubber hand by making a stabbing movement toward it with a needle (not actually making contact with the rubber hand). MRI scans showed increase activity in a region of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex that is normally activated when a person anticipates pain, along with the supplementary motor area, that is normally activated when a person feels the urge to move his or her arm (Fried et al., 1991; Peyron, Laurent, and Garcia-Larrea, 2000). The anticipation of the needle made the subjects react as if the rubber hand was their own, moving their real hand to avoid the needle even though it was never actually in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (2010). Physiology of behavior, 11th Edition. New York: Allyn &amp; Bacon. A LA CARTE version MyPsychLab w/e-Text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusion induced through virtual reality==
One of the ways in which  body transfer illusion has been studied is through [[virtual reality]] simulation where a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body has appeared to substitute the male subjects' own body. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the [[virtual body]]. The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms, such as those involving the [[premotor cortex]] and [[cerebellum]], can temporarily override top down knowledge therefore resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. In the study, male participants  entered the virtual reality simulation and experienced various forms of stimulation including arm-stroking and other physical sensations. Afterwards the heart rate was monitored and  a questionnaire was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Slater M, Spanlang B, Sanchez-Vives MV, Blanke O, 2010. First Person Experience of Body Transfer in Virtual Reality. PLoS ONE 5(5): e10564. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0010564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Body transfer illusion has been used in order to treat the experience of [[phantom limb pain]] by giving visual feedback of the missing limb. The [[mirror box]] gives visual feedback that can allow a person using it the opportunity to "see" the missing hand, and to manipulate the hand in an attempt to relieve pain or discomfort. [[Virtual reality]] is also used to treat phantom limb pain in a similar way, by allowing the user to "see" the missing limb within the virtual world and manipulate it however they choose.

==Neural basis==
The integration of touch stimulation via the [[somatosensory system]] with visual input is essential for creating the body transfer illusion. When the body is not in motion, it perceives its position in space through the integration of multi-modal afferent signals. Motion of the body adds efferent signal information and leads to a more fluid perception of body transfer. When information from one form of signal (e.g. touch) does not match the signals from another sense (e.g. vision), the body still attempts to integrate this information.&lt;ref&gt;Manos Tsakiris, Simone Schutz-Bosbach, Shaun Gallagher, "One agency and body-ownership: Phenomenologial and neurocognitive reflections" Consciousness and Cognition Volume 16, 2007, Pages 645-660 {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2007.05.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the [[Multisensory integration#Rubber hand illusion|rubber hand illusion]] is associated with activity in the multisensory areas, most notably the ventral premotor cortex. However, it remains to be demonstrated that this illusion does not simply reflect the dominant role of vision and that the premotor activity does not reflect a visual representation of an object near the hand.&lt;ref&gt; H. Henrik Ehrsson,1 Nicholas P. Holmes,2 and Richard E. Passingham1[http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/45/10564.short Touching a Rubber Hand: Feeling of Body Ownership Is Associated with Activity in Multisensory Brain Areas] The Journal of Neuroscience, November 9, 2005, 25(45):10564-10573; {{doi|10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0800-05.2005}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug-induced enhancement==
With [[ketamine]], the body transfer illusion is ultimately enhanced and participants are more vulnerable to a false sense of limb ownership than without the use of ketamine. Although the precise nature of ketamine's impact is speculative, two features of its effects are noteworthy. First, it promotes an overall increase in the subjective and behavioral indexes of the illusion. Second, this effect is found even when a sensory asynchrony is present, a manipulation that would normally reduce the experience of the illusion. This pattern may be understood in terms of the drug's impact on the top-down–bottom-up balance that would normally account for the illusion's characteristic features since ketamine produces an overall increase in tendency to the illusion, whereas this sensitivity to the coherence of visual and tactile input is preserved. A further possibility is that ketamine enhances the salience of the visual input (the sight of a rubber hand in a position compatible with one's own hand) at the expense of information arising from the temporal asynchrony between sensory inputs. This would explain why the presence of the rubber hand is enough to enable the illusion to persist, even when in attenuated form, when visuo-tactile inputs are asynchronous.&lt;ref&gt;L. Morgana, Danielle C. Turnerb, Philip R. Corlett, "Exploring the Impact of Ketamine on the Experience of Illusory Body Ownership" Biological Psychiatry Volume 69, Issue 1, 1 January 2011, Pages 35-41 {{doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.032}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar effect occurs with the administration of the [[dopamine]] and [[noradrenaline]] releasing agent [[dextroamphetamine]]. The similarities include increased subjective reports of embodiment of the rubber hand during the illusion, and that the dextroamphetamine enhancing effect is also seen during sensory asynchrony. &lt;ref&gt;MA Albrecht, MT Martin-Iverson, G Price, J Lee, R Iyyalol, F Waters, "Dexamphetamine effects on separate constructs in the rubber hand illusion test" Psychopharmacology Volume 217, Issue 1, 2011, Pages 39-50 {{doi|10.1007/s00213-011-2255-y}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind-body connection==
Human bodily experience is characterized by the immediate and continuous experience that our body and its parts belong to us, often called [[attribution (psychology)|self-attribution]], body ownership and or mineness. It is unknown if the origin of body representation is innate or if it is constructed from sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Costantini, Patrick Haggard, "The rubber hand illusion: Sensitivity and reference frame for body ownership", [[Consciousness and Cognition]], Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 229–240, ISSN 1053-8100, {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2007.01.001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related, but distinct, bodily experience is self-localization or embodiment that is defined as the experience that the self is localized at the position of our body at a certain position in space. Recent philosophical and neurological theories converge on the relevance of such bodily experiences and associated processing of bodily information as one promising approach for the development of a comprehensive neurobiological model of self-consciousness.

In [[typography]], a '''bouma''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|m|ə}} {{respell|BOH|mə}}) is the [[shape]] of a cluster of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], often a whole [[word]]. It is a reduction of "Bouma-shape", which was probably first used in [[Paul Saenger]]'s 1997 book ''Space between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading'', although Saenger himself attributes it to Insup &amp; Maurice Martin Taylor. Its origin is in reference to hypotheses by prominent vision researcher [[Herman Bouma]], who studied the shapes and confusability of letters and letter strings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Bouma|Bouma, H.]] (1971).  Visual Recognition of Isolated Lower-Case Letters.  Vision Research, 11, 459-474.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bouma, H. (1973). Visual Interference in the Parafoveal Recognition of Initial and Final Letters of Words, Vision Research, 13, 762-782.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[typography|typographers]] believe that, when reading, people can recognize words by deciphering boumas, not just individual [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], or that the shape of the word is related to readability and/or legibility. The claim is that this is a natural strategy for increasing reading efficiency. However, considerable study and experimentation by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] led to their general acceptance of a different, and largely contradictory, theory by the end of the 1980s: [[parallel letterwise recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, M.J. (1979). Models of word recognition. Cognitive Psychology, 11, 133-176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L. &amp; Johnson, J.C. (1977). The role of familiar units in perception of words and nonwords. Perception and Psychophysics, 22, 249-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paap, K.R., Newsome, S.L., &amp; Noel, R.W. (1984). Word shape’s in poor shape for the race to the lexicon. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 10, 413-428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, K. (1975). The perceptual span and peripheral cues in reading. Cognitive Psychology, 7, 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years (starting from 2000) parallel letterwise recognition has been more evangelized to typographers by Microsoft's Dr Kevin Larson, via conference presentations and a widely read article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx|title=The Science of Word Recognition|work=microsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ongoing research (starting from 2009) often supports the bouma model of reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gumc.georgetown.edu/news/After-Learning-New-Words-Brain-Sees-Them-as-Pictures|title=After Learning New Words, Brain Sees Them As Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/35/12/4965.full.pdf|title=Adding Words to the Brain’s Visual Dictionary: Novel Word Learning Selectively Sharpens Orthographic Representations in the VWFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1837">'''Brand aversion''' is an antonym of [[brand loyalty]]. It is a distrust or a dislike of products from a particular [[brand]] on the basis of past experiences with that brand and its products, similar to [[taste aversion]].

Brand aversion can be the effect of obtrusive [[marketing]] strategies, bad press, a mass [[product recall]], or other poor [[product launch]]es.

Psychologically, the reasons for brand aversion have been explained by the attachment-aversion model using the same three dimensions ("'''3 E'''s") that characterize a product:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/choong/intellcont/AA%20Model%20of%20Customer_Brand_Relationships%20Jan_09_2013-2.docx|title=Attachment-aversion (AA) model of customer-brand relationships |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |author1=Whan Park |author2=Andreas B.

#enticing/annoying the self
#enabling/disabling the self and
#enriching/impoverishing the self (benefits/liabilities).
The more annoying/disabling/impoverishing a brand "feels", the more aversion will be produced and vice versa. As is the case with all brands, the conceived qualities need neither correspond to real assets nor shortcomings.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalizes [[mathematical structure]] and its concepts in terms of a labeled [[directed graph]] called a ''[[Category (mathematics)|category]]'', whose nodes are called  ''objects'', and whose labelled directed edges are called  ''arrows'' (or [[morphism]]s). A [[Category (mathematics)|category]] has two basic properties: the ability to [[Function composition|compose]] the arrows [[Associativity|associatively]], and the existence of an [[Identity function|identity]] arrow for each object. The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level [[abstractions]] such as [[set theory|sets]], [[ring theory|rings]], and [[group theory|groups]]. Informally, category theory is a general theory of [[function (mathematics)|functions]].

Several terms used in category theory, including the term "morphism", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics. In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.

[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced the concepts of categories, [[functor]]s, and [[natural transformation]]s in 1942–45 in their study of [[algebraic topology]], with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.

Category theory has practical applications in [[programming language theory]], for example the usage of [[Monad (functional programming)|monads in functional programming]].   It may also be used as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics, as an alternative to [[set theory]] and other proposed foundations.

==Basic concepts  ==
Categories represent abstractions of other mathematical concepts.
Many areas of mathematics can be formalised by category theory as [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. Hence category theory uses abstraction to make it possible to state and prove many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields in a much simpler way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geroch|first=Robert|title=Mathematical physics|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-28862-8|pages=7|edition=[Repr.]|quote=Note that theorem 3 is actually easier for categories in general than it is for the special case of sets. This phenomenon is by no means rare.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic example of a category is the [[category of sets]], where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set to another.  However, the objects of a category need not be sets, and the arrows need not be functions. Any way of formalising a mathematical concept such that it meets the basic conditions on the behaviour of objects and arrows is a valid category—and all the results of category theory apply to it.

The "arrows" of category theory are often said to represent a process connecting two objects, or in many cases a "structure-preserving" transformation connecting two objects. There are, however, many applications where much more abstract concepts are represented by objects and morphisms. The most important property of the arrows is that they can be "composed", in other words, arranged in a sequence to form a new arrow.

== Applications of categories==
Categories now appear in many branches of mathematics, some areas of [[theoretical computer science]] where they can correspond to [[Data type|types]] or to [[database schema]]s, and [[mathematical physics]] where they can be used to describe [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke, editor [https://www.springer.com/jp/book/9783642128202#aboutBook New Structures for Physics] Number 831 in Lecture Notes in Physics. Springer-Verlag, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linear algebra]] can also be expressed in terms of categories of matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macedo | first1 = H.D. | last2 = Oliveira | first2 = J.N. | year = 2013 | title = Typing linear algebra: A biproduct-oriented approach | doi = 10.1016/j.scico.2012.07.012 | journal = Science of Computer Programming | volume = 78 | issue = 11| pages = 2160–2191 | arxiv = 1312.4818 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.747.2083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the first application of category theory outside pure mathematics was the "metabolism-repair" model of  autonomous living organisms by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=Robert|title=The representation of biological systems from the standpoint of the theory of categories|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics|date=1958|volume=20|pages=317–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Utility ==

=== Categories, objects, and morphisms ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The study of [[category (mathematics)|categories]] is an attempt to ''axiomatically'' capture what is commonly found in various classes of related [[mathematical structures]] by relating them to the ''structure-preserving functions'' between them. A systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category.

Consider the following example. The [[class (set theory)|class]] '''Grp''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] consists of all objects having a "group structure". One can proceed to [[mathematical proof|prove]] [[theorem]]s about groups by making logical deductions from the set of axioms defining groups. For example, it is immediately proven from the axioms that the [[identity element]] of a group is unique.

Instead of focusing merely on the individual objects (e.g., groups) possessing a given structure, category theory emphasizes the [[morphism]]s – the structure-preserving mappings – ''between'' these objects; by studying these morphisms, one is able to learn more about the structure of the objects. In the case of groups, the morphisms are the [[group homomorphism]]s. A group homomorphism between two groups "preserves the group structure" in a precise sense; informally it is a "process" taking one group to another, in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group. The study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms.

A similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories, such as the study of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps (morphisms) between [[topological space]]s in [[topology]] (the associated category is called '''Top'''), and the study of [[smooth function]]s (morphisms) in [[manifold theory]].

Not all categories arise as "structure preserving (set) functions", however; the standard example is the category of homotopies between [[pointed topological space]]s.

If one axiomatizes [[Finitary relation|relations]] instead of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], one obtains the theory of [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]].

=== Functors ===
{{Main|Functor}}
{{See also|Adjoint functors#Motivation}}

A category is ''itself'' a type of mathematical structure, so we can look for "processes" which preserve this structure in some sense; such a process is called a [[functor]].

[[Diagram chasing]] is a visual method of arguing with abstract "arrows" joined in diagrams. Functors are represented by arrows between categories, subject to specific defining commutativity conditions. Functors can define (construct) categorical diagrams and sequences (viz. Mitchell, 1965){{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. A functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category, and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second.

As a result, this defines a category ''of categories and functors'' – the objects are categories, and the morphisms (between categories) are functors.

Studying categories and functors is not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them but rather the ''relationships between various classes of mathematical structures''. This fundamental idea first surfaced in [[algebraic topology]]. Difficult ''topological'' questions can be translated into ''algebraic'' questions which are often easier to solve.  Basic constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]] or the [[fundamental groupoid]] of a [[topological space]], can be expressed as functors to the category of [[groupoid]]s in this way, and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications.

=== Natural transformations ===
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

Abstracting yet again, some diagrammatic and/or sequential constructions are often "naturally related" – a vague notion, at first sight. This leads to the clarifying concept of [[natural transformation]], a way to "map" one functor to another. Many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context. "Naturality" is a principle, like [[general covariance]] in physics, that cuts deeper than is initially apparent. An arrow between two functors is a natural transformation when it is subject to certain naturality or commutativity conditions.

Functors and natural transformations ('naturality') are the key concepts in category theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mac Lane|1998|loc=p. 18: "As Eilenberg-Mac Lane first observed, 'category' has been defined in order to be able to define 'functor' and 'functor' has been defined in order to be able to define 'natural transformation'."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories, objects, and morphisms ==
{{Main|Category (mathematics)|Morphism}}

=== Categories ===
A ''category'' ''C'' consists of the following three mathematical entities:
* A [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C''), whose elements are called ''objects'';
* A class hom(''C''), whose elements are called [[morphism]]s or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] or ''arrows''. Each morphism '''''f''''' has a ''source object '''a''''' and ''target object '''b'''''. &lt;br /&gt;The expression {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, would be verbally stated as "''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''".&lt;br /&gt;The expression {{nowrap|1='''hom(''a'', ''b'')'''}} – alternatively expressed as {{nowrap|1='''hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, {{nowrap|1='''mor(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, or {{nowrap|1='''''C''(''a'', ''b'')'''}} – denotes the ''hom-class'' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''.
* A [[binary operation]] ∘, called ''composition of morphisms'', such that for any three objects ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have {{nowrap|1=∘ : hom(''b'', ''c'') × hom(''a'', ''b'') → hom(''a'', ''c'')}}. The composition of {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''c''}} is written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}} or ''gf'',{{efn|Some authors compose in the opposite order, writing ''fg'' or {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}}.  Computer scientists using category theory very commonly write {{nowrap|1=''f'' ; ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}}}} governed by two axioms:
** [[Associativity]]: If {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''h'' : ''c'' → ''d''}} then {{nowrap|1=''h'' ∘  (''g'' ∘ ''f'') = (''h'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ ''f''}}, and
** [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]: For every object ''x'', there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''x'' → ''x''}} called the ''[[identity morphism]] for x'', such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, we have {{nowrap|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''f'' = ''f'' ∘ 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
:: From the axioms, it can be proved that there is exactly one [[identity morphism]] for every object. Some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism.

=== Morphisms ===
Relations among morphisms (such as {{nowrap|1=''fg'' = ''h''}}) are often depicted using [[commutative diagram]]s, with "points" (corners) representing objects and "arrows" representing morphisms.

[[Morphism]]s can have any of the following properties. A morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}} is a:
* [[monomorphism]] (or ''monic'') if {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x'' → ''a''}}.
* [[epimorphism]] (or ''epic'') if {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''b'' → ''x''}}.
* ''bimorphism'' if ''f'' is both epic and monic.
* [[isomorphism]] if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g'' ∘ ''f'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.{{efn|Note that a morphism that is both epic and monic is not necessarily an isomorphism! An elementary counterexample: in the category consisting of two objects ''A'' and ''B'', the identity morphisms, and a single morphism ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B'', ''f'' is both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism.}}
* [[endomorphism]] if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}. end(''a'') denotes the class of endomorphisms of ''a''.
* [[automorphism]] if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. aut(''a'') denotes the class of automorphisms of ''a''.
* [[retract (category theory)|retraction]] if a right inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* [[section (category theory)|section]] if a left inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Every retraction is an epimorphism, and every section is a monomorphism. Furthermore, the following three statements are equivalent:
* ''f'' is a monomorphism and a retraction;
* ''f'' is an epimorphism and a section;
* ''f'' is an isomorphism.

==Functors==
{{Main|Functor}}

[[Functor]]s are structure-preserving maps between categories. They can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all (small) categories.

A ('''covariant''') functor ''F'' from a category ''C'' to a category ''D'', written {{nowrap|1=''F'' : ''C'' → ''D''}}, consists of:
* for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object ''F''(''x'') in ''D''; and
* for each morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} in ''C'', a morphism {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''x'') → ''F''(''y'')}},

such that the following two properties hold:
* For every object ''x'' in ''C'', {{nowrap|1=''F''(1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''F''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* For all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''y'' → ''z''}}, {{nowrap|1=''F''(''g'' ∘ ''f'') = ''F''(''g'') ∘ ''F''(''f'')}}.

A '''contravariant''' functor {{nowrap|1=''F'': ''C'' → ''D''}} is like a covariant functor, except that it "turns morphisms around" ("reverses all the arrows"). More specifically, every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} in ''C'' must be assigned to a morphism  {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''y'') → ''F''(''x'')}} in ''D''. In other words, a contravariant functor acts as a covariant functor from the [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to ''D''.

==Natural transformations==
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

A ''natural transformation'' is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe "natural constructions" and natural transformations then describe "natural homomorphisms" between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield "the same" result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors.

If ''F'' and ''G'' are (covariant) functors between the categories ''C'' and ''D'', then a natural transformation η from ''F'' to ''G'' associates to every object ''X'' in ''C'' a morphism {{nowrap|1=η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''F''(''X'') → ''G''(''X'')}} in ''D'' such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} in ''C'', we have {{nowrap|1=η&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''F''(''f'') = ''G''(''f'') ∘ η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; this means that the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]]:

[[Image:Natural transformation.svg|175px|center|Commutative diagram defining natural transformations]]

The two functors ''F'' and ''G'' are called ''naturally isomorphic'' if there exists a natural transformation from ''F'' to ''G'' such that η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isomorphism for every object ''X'' in ''C''.

==Other concepts==

===Universal constructions, limits, and colimits===
{{Main|Universal property|Limit (category theory)}}

Using the language of category theory, many areas of mathematical study can be categorized. Categories include sets, groups and topologies.

Each category is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, such as the [[empty set]] or the [[product topology|product of two topologies]], yet in the definition of a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we ''do not know'' whether an object ''A'' is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find ''[[universal property|universal properties]]'' that uniquely determine the objects of interest.

Numerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way if the ''[[category theory|category limit]]'' can be developed and dualized to yield the notion of a ''colimit''.

===Equivalent categories===
{{Main|Equivalence of categories|Isomorphism of categories}}

It is a natural question to ask: under which conditions can two categories be considered ''essentially the same'', in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category? The major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called ''equivalence of categories'', which is given by appropriate functors between two categories. Categorical equivalence has found [[Equivalence of categories#Examples|numerous applications]] in mathematics.

===Further concepts and results===
The definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra; additional important topics are listed below. Although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics, the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading.
* The [[functor category]] ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;/sup&gt; has as objects the functors from ''C'' to ''D'' and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [[Yoneda lemma]] is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories.
* [[Dual (category theory)|Duality]]: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a ''dual'' which is essentially obtained by "reversing all the arrows". If one statement is true in a category ''C'' then its dual is true in the dual category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships.
* [[Adjoint functors]]: A functor can be left (or right) adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.

===Higher-dimensional categories===
{{Main|Higher category theory}}
Many of the above concepts, especially equivalence of categories, adjoint functor pairs, and functor categories, can be situated into the context of ''higher-dimensional categories''. Briefly, if we consider a morphism between two objects as a "process taking us from one object to another", then higher-dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering "higher-dimensional processes".

For example, a (strict) [[2-category]] is a category together with "morphisms between morphisms", i.e., processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another. We can then "compose" these "bimorphisms" both horizontally and vertically, and we require a 2-dimensional "exchange law" to hold, relating the two composition laws. In this context, the standard example is '''Cat''', the 2-category of all (small) categories, and in this example, bimorphisms of morphisms are simply [[natural transformation]]s of morphisms in the usual sense. Another basic example is to consider a 2-category with a single object; these are essentially [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]. [[bicategory|Bicategories]] are a weaker notion of 2-dimensional categories in which the composition of morphisms is not strictly associative, but only associative "up to" an isomorphism.

This process can be extended for all [[natural number]]s ''n'', and these are called [[n-category|''n''-categories]]. There is even a notion of ''[[quasi-category|ω-category]]'' corresponding to the [[ordinal number]] [[ω (ordinal number)|ω]].

Higher-dimensional categories are part of the broader mathematical field of [[higher-dimensional algebra]], a concept introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]].  For a conversational introduction to these ideas, see [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html John Baez, 'A Tale of ''n''-categories' (1996).]

{{main|Timeline of category theory and related mathematics}}
{{rquote|right|It should be observed first that the whole concept of a  category is essentially an auxiliary one; our basic concepts are essentially those of a functor and of a natural transformation [...]|[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]]|General theory of natural equivalences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eilenberg|first=Samuel|last2=MacLane|first2=Saunders|date=1945|title=General theory of natural equivalences|url=https://www.ams.org/tran/1945-058-00/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6/|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|volume=58|pages=247|doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6|issn=0002-9947}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1942–45, [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced categories, functors, and natural transformations as part of their work in topology, especially [[algebraic topology]]. Their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[axiom]]atic [[homology theory]]. Eilenberg and Mac Lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations. That required defining functors, which required categories.

[[Stanislaw Ulam]], and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, a continuation of the work of [[Emmy Noether]] (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that understanding a type of mathematical structure requires understanding the processes that preserve that structure. To achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes that preserve them.

The subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of [[homological algebra]], and later by the axiomatic needs of [[algebraic geometry]]. General category theory, an extension of [[universal algebra]] having many new features allowing for [[semantic]] flexibility and [[higher-order logic]], came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics.

Certain categories called [[topos|topoi]] (singular ''topos'') can even serve as an alternative to [[axiomatic set theory]] as a foundation of mathematics. A topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms. These foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. [[Topos|Topos theory]] is a form of abstract [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]], with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as [[pointless topology]].

[[Categorical logic]] is now a well-defined field based on [[type theory]] for [[intuitionistic logic]]s, with applications in [[functional programming]] and [[domain theory]], where a [[cartesian closed category]] is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [[lambda calculus]]. At the very least, category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common (in some [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] sense).

Category theory has been applied in other fields as well. For example, [[John Baez]] has shown a link between [[Feynman diagrams]] in Physics and monoidal categories.&lt;ref name="Baez09"&gt;{{cite arxiv |first1=J.C. |last1=Baez |first2=M. |last2=Stay |title=Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta stone |year=2009 |eprint=0903.0340 |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of category theory, more specifically: topos theory, has been made in mathematical music theory, see for example the book ''The Topos of Music, Geometric Logic of Concepts, Theory, and Performance'' by [[Guerino Mazzola]].

More recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include those of [[William Lawvere]] and Rosebrugh (2003) and Lawvere and [[Stephen Schanuel]] (1997) and Mirroslav Yotov (2012).

'''Cherenkov radiation''' (pronunciation: /tʃɛrɛnˈkɔv/) is an [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted when a [[charged particle]] (such as an [[electron]]) passes through a [[dielectric]] medium at a [[speed]] greater than the [[phase velocity]] of [[speed of light|light]] in that medium. It is also known as the '''Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation''' ('''VCR''') (named after [[Sergey Vavilov]] and [[Pavel Cherenkov]]). It is named after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist Pavel Cherenkov, the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] winner who was the first to detect it experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cherenkov |first=P.

Cherenkov radiation had been theoretically predicted by the [[England|English]] [[polymath]] [[Oliver Heaviside]] in papers published in 1888–89.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Oliver_Heaviside.html?id=e9wEntQmA0IC |year=1988 |pages=125–126 |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |isbn=9780801869099 |last1=Nahin |first1=P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic blue glow of an underwater [[nuclear reactor]] is due to Cherenkov radiation.

==Physical origin==
While [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] holds that the [[speed of light]] ''in a [[vacuum]]'' is a [[physical constants|universal constant]] (''c''), the speed at which light propagates in a material may be significantly less than ''c''. For example, the speed of the propagation of light in [[water]] is only 0.75''c''. [[Matter]] can be accelerated beyond this speed (although still to less than ''c'') during nuclear reactions and in [[particle accelerator]]s. Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an [[electron]], travels through a [[dielectric]] (electrically polarizable) medium with a speed greater than that at which light propagates in the same medium.

Moreover, the velocity that must be exceeded is the [[phase velocity]] of light rather than the [[group velocity]] of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, and in that case one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with ''no'' minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the [[Smith–Purcell effect]]. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a [[photonic crystal]], one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).&lt;ref name=Luo03&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www-math.mit.edu/~stevenj/papers/LuoIb03.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1079549 |title=Cerenkov Radiation in Photonic Crystals |year=2003 |last1=Luo |first1=C. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=299 |issue=5605 |pages=368–71 |pmid=12532010 |last2=Ibanescu |first2=M. |last3=Johnson |first3=S. G. |last4=Joannopoulos |first4=J. D. |bibcode=2003Sci...299..368L |citeseerx=10.1.1.540.8969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:cherenkov.svg|thumb|The geometry of the Cherenkov radiation (shown for the ideal case of no dispersion).]]

In their original work on the theoretical foundations of Cherenkov radiation, Tamm and Frank wrote,"This peculiar radiation can evidently not be explained by any common mechanism such as the interaction of the fast electron with individual atom or as radiative scattering of electrons on atomic nuclei.  On the other hand, the phenomenon can be explained both qualitatively and quantitatively if one takes in account the fact that an electron moving in a medium does radiate light even if it is moving uniformly provided that its velocity is greater
than the velocity of light in the medium.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=I.E.|last1=Tamm|first2=I.M.|last2=Frank|title= Coherent radiation of fast electrons in a medium|journal= Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR |volume=14|pages=107|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some misconceptions regarding Cherenkov radiation exist: for example, it is believed that the medium becomes electrically polarized by the particle's electric field. If the particle travels slowly then the disturbance elastically relaxes back to [[mechanical equilibrium]] as the particle passes. When the particle is traveling fast enough, however, the limited response speed of the medium means that a disturbance is left in the wake of the particle, and the energy contained in this disturbance radiates as a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] shockwave. Such conceptions do not have any analytical foundation, as electromagnetic radiation is emitted when charged particles move in a dielectric medium at subluminal velocities which are not considered as Cherenkov radiation.

A common analogy is the [[sonic boom]] of a [[supersonic]] [[aircraft]] or [[bullet]]. The [[sound]] waves generated by the [[supersonic]] body propagate at the speed of sound itself; as such, the waves travel slower than the speeding object and cannot propagate forward from the body, instead forming a [[shock wave|shock front]]. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light [[shock wave]] as it travels through an insulator.

In the figure, the particle (red arrow) travels in a medium with speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c/n &lt; v_\text{p} &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is [[speed of light in vacuum]], and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium. (If the medium is water, the condition is &lt;math&gt;0.75c &lt; v_\text{p} &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;n=1.33&lt;/math&gt; for water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C.)

We define the ratio between the speed of the particle and the speed of light as &lt;math&gt;\beta=v_\text{p}/c&lt;/math&gt;. The emitted [[Electromagnetic radiation|light waves]] (blue arrows) travel at speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{em}=c/n&lt;/math&gt;.

The left corner of the triangle represents the location of the superluminal particle at some initial moment (''t''=0). The right corner of the triangle is the location of the particle at some later time t. In the given time ''t'', the particle travels the distance

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{p}=v_\text{p}t=\beta\,ct&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the emitted electromagnetic waves are constricted to travel the distance

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{em}=v_\text{em}t=\frac{c}{n}t.&lt;/math&gt;

So:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac1{n\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since this ratio is independent of time, one can take arbitrary times and achieve [[similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]]. The angle stays the same, meaning that subsequent waves generated between the initial time ''t''=0 and final time ''t'' will form similar triangles with coinciding right endpoints to the one shown.

===Reverse Cherenkov effect===
A reverse Cherenkov effect can be experienced using materials called negative-index [[metamaterial]]s (materials with a subwavelength microstructure that gives them an effective "average" property very different from their constituent materials, in this case having negative [[permittivity]] and negative [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]). This means, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle will emit trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than in front of it (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schewe |first=P. F. |last2=Stein |first2=B. |title=Topsy turvy: The first true "left handed" material |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=24 March 2004 |accessdate=1 December 2008 |url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2000/split/pnu476-1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131202757/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2000/split/pnu476-1.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media (where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial).&lt;ref name=Luo03/&gt;

===Arbitrary Cherenkov emission angle===
Cherenkov radiation can also radiate in an arbitrary direction using properly engineered one dimensional [[metamaterial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genevet|first=P. |last2=Wintz |first2=D. |last3=Ambrosio |first3=A.|last4=She |first4=A. |last5=Blanchard |first5=R. |last6=Capasso |first6=F. |title=Controlled steering of Cherenkov surface plasmon wakes with a one-dimensional metamaterial |journal=[[Nature Nanotechnology]] |volume=10 |issue=|pages=804–809 |year=2015 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2015.137|bibcode = 2015NatNa..10..804G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is designed to introduce a gradient of phase retardation along the trajectory of the fast travelling particle (&lt;math&gt; d\phi/dx&lt;/math&gt; ), reversing or steering Cherenkov emission at arbitrary angles given by the generalized relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac1{n\beta} +\frac {n}{k_0} \cdot \frac {d\phi} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[frequency spectrum]] of Cherenkov radiation by a particle is given by the [[Frank–Tamm formula]]:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2E}{dx \, d\omega} = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi} \mu(\omega) \omega {\left(1 - \frac{c^2} {v^2 n^2(\omega)}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

The Frank-Tamm formula describes the amount of energy emitted from Cherenkov radiation, per wavelength, per unit length traveled. &lt;math&gt;\mu(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Refractive index|index of refraction]] of the material the charge particle moves through.

Unlike [[fluorescence]] or [[stimulated emission|emission]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] that have characteristic spectral peaks, Cherenkov radiation is continuous. Around the visible spectrum, the relative intensity per unit frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter [[wavelength]]s) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the [[ultraviolet]] spectrum—it is only with sufficiently accelerated charges that it even becomes visible; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum.

There is a cut-off frequency above which the equation &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=1/(n\beta)&lt;/math&gt; can no longer be satisfied. The [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; varies with frequency (and hence with wavelength) in such a way that the intensity cannot continue to increase at ever shorter wavelengths, even for very relativistic particles (where v/[[speed of light|c]] is close to 1). At [[X-ray]] frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than unity (note that in media the phase velocity may exceed ''c'' without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as [[gamma ray]]s) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below the frequencies corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonant frequency (see [[Kramers-Kronig relation]] and [[anomalous dispersion]]).

As in sonic booms and bow shocks, the angle of the shock [[cone (geometry)|cone]] is directly related to the velocity of the disruption. The Cherenkov angle is zero at the threshold velocity for the emission of Cherenkov radiation. The angle takes on a maximum as the particle speed approaches the speed of light. Hence, observed angles of incidence can be used to compute the direction and speed of a Cherenkov radiation-producing charge.

Cherenkov radiation can be generated in the eye by charged particles hitting the [[vitreous humour]], giving the impression of flashes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Vavilov – Cherenkov radiation: Its discovery and application |year=2009 |last1=Bolotovskii |first1=B.

==Uses==

===Detection of labelled biomolecules===
Cherenkov radiation is widely used to facilitate the detection of small amounts and low concentrations of [[biomolecule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=H. |last2=Zhang |first2=X. |last3=Xing |first3=B. |last4=Han |first4=P. |last5=Gambhir |first5=S.

===Nuclear reactors===
[[File:TrigaReactorCore.jpeg|thumb|landscape|right|Cherenkov radiation in a [[TRIGA]] [[pool-type reactor|reactor pool]].]]
Cherenkov radiation is used to detect high-energy charged particles. In [[pool-type reactor|pool-type nuclear reactors]], [[beta particles]] (high-energy electrons) are released as the [[fission products]] decay. The glow continues after the chain reaction stops, dimming as the shorter-lived products decay. Similarly, Cherenkov radiation can characterize the remaining [[radioactivity]] of spent fuel rods. This phenomenon is used to verify the presence of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel pools for nuclear safeguards purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-0221/12/06/T06001 |bibcode=2017JInst..12.6001B |title=On Cherenkov light production by irradiated nuclear fuel rods |journal=Journal of Instrumentation |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=T06001 |last1=Branger |first1=E |last2=Grape |first2=S |last3=Jacobsson Svärd |first3=S |last4=Jansson |first4=P |last5=Andersson Sundén |first5=E |year=2017 |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-309736 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrophysics experiments===
When a high-energy ([[TeV]]) [[gamma photon]] or [[cosmic ray]] interacts with the [[Earth's atmosphere]], it may produce an electron-[[positron]] [[pair production|pair]] with enormous velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is used to determine the direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the [[IACT|Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique]] ([[IACT]]), by experiments such as [[VERITAS]], [[H.E.S.S.]], [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]]. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment [[High Altitude Water Cherenkov Experiment|HAWC]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large [[neutrino]] detectors, such as the [[Super-Kamiokande]], the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)]] and [[IceCube]]. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as [[STACEE]], a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in [[New Mexico]].

Astrophysics observatories using the Cherenkov technique to measure air showers are key to determine the properties of astronomical objects that emit Very High Energy gamma rays, such as [[supernova remnant]]s and [[blazar]]s.

===Particle physics experiments===
{{See also|Cherenkov detector|Ring imaging Cherenkov detector}}

Cherenkov radiation is commonly used in experimental [[particle physics]] for particle identification. One could measure (or put limits on) the [[velocity]] of an electrically charged elementary particle by the properties of the Cherenkov light it emits in a certain medium. If the [[momentum]] of the particle is measured independently, one could compute the [[mass]] of the particle by its momentum and velocity (see [[four-momentum]]), and hence identify the particle.

The simplest type of particle identification device based on a Cherenkov radiation technique is the threshold counter, which gives an answer as to whether the velocity of a charged particle is lower or higher than a certain value (&lt;math&gt;v_0=c/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium) by looking at whether this particle does or does not emit Cherenkov light in a certain medium. Knowing particle momentum, one can separate particles lighter than a certain threshold from those heavier than the threshold.

The most advanced type of a detector is the RICH, or [[Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector]], developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius of which is a measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID),&lt;ref&gt;[http://alice-hmpid.web.cern.ch The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector at CERN]&lt;/ref&gt; a detector currently under construction for ALICE ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment]]), one of the six experiments at the LHC ([[Large Hadron Collider]]) at [[CERN]].

==Vacuum Cherenkov radiation==
The Cherenkov effect can occur in vacuum.{{Citation needed|reason=Vacuum Cherenkov radiation would contradict special relativity|date=November 2018}} In a slow-wave structure,{{explain |date=July 2016}} the [[phase velocity]] decreases and the velocity of charged particles can exceed the phase velocity while remaining lower than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In such a system, this effect can be derived from conservation of the energy and momentum where the momentum of a [[photon]] should be &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar\beta&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; is [[phase constant]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11082-015-0261-8 |title=Generalized momentum equation of quantum mechanics |journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics |volume=48 |issue=2 |year=2016 |last1=Wang |first1=Zhong-Yue }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, the '''clutching construction''' is a way of constructing fiber bundles, particularly vector bundles on spheres.

==Definition==
Consider the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; as the union of the upper and lower hemispheres &lt;math&gt;D^n_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D^n_-&lt;/math&gt; along their intersection, the equator, an &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given trivialized [[fiber bundle]]s with fiber &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and structure group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over the two disks, then given a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon S^{n-1} \to G&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''clutching map''), glue the two trivial bundles together via ''f''.

Formally, it is the [[coequalizer]] of the inclusions &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \times F \to D^n_+ \times F \coprod D^n_- \times F&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;(x,v) \mapsto (x,v) \in D^n_+ \times F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x,v) \mapsto (x,f(x)(v)) \in D^n_- \times F&lt;/math&gt;: glue the two bundles together on the boundary, with a twist.

Thus we have a map &lt;math&gt;\pi_{n-1} G \to \text{Fib}_F(S^n)&lt;/math&gt;: clutching information on the equator yields a fiber bundle on the total space.

In the case of vector bundles, this yields &lt;math&gt;\pi_{n-1} O(k) \to \text{Vect}_k(S^n)&lt;/math&gt;, and indeed this map is an isomorphism (under connect sum of spheres on the right).

===Generalization===
The above can be generalized by replacing the disks and sphere with any closed triad &lt;math&gt;(X;A,B)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a space ''X'', together with two closed subsets ''A'' and ''B'' whose union is ''X''. Then a clutching map on &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; gives a vector bundle on ''X''.

===Classifying map construction===

Let &lt;math&gt;p \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; be a fibre bundle with fibre &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of pairs &lt;math&gt;(U_i,q_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;q_i \colon p^{-1}(U_i) \to N \times F&lt;/math&gt; is a local trivialization of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;U_i \subset N&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, we demand that the union of all the sets &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the collection is an atlas of trivializations &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i = N&lt;/math&gt;). 

Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i\times F&lt;/math&gt; modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;(u_i,f_i)\in U_i \times F&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(u_j,f_j)\in U_j \times F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;U_i \cap U_j \neq \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}(u_j,f_j) = (u_i,f_i)&lt;/math&gt;. By design, the local trivializations &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; give a fibrewise equivalence between this quotient space and the fibre bundle &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\coprod_i U_i\times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;(u_i,h_i)\in U_i \times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(u_j,h_j)\in U_j \times \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;U_i \cap U_j \neq \phi&lt;/math&gt; and consider &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be a map &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1} : U_i \cap U_j \to \operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; then we demand that &lt;math&gt;q_i \circ q_j^{-1}(u_j)(h_j)=h_i&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, in our re-construction of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; we are replacing the fibre &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the topological group of homeomorphisms of the fibre, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. If the structure group of the bundle is known to reduce, you could replace &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; with the reduced structure group.  This is a bundle over &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with fibre &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt; and is a principal bundle.  Denote it by &lt;math&gt;p \colon M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;. The relation to the previous bundle is induced from the principal bundle: &lt;math&gt;(M_p \times F)/\operatorname{Homeo}(F) = M&lt;/math&gt;. 

So we have a principal bundle &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F) \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of classifying spaces gives us an induced '''push-forward''' fibration &lt;math&gt;M_p \to N \to B(\operatorname{Homeo}(F))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;B(Homeo(F))&lt;/math&gt; is the classifying space of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Homeo}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an outline:

Given a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-principal bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt;, consider the space &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_{G} EG&lt;/math&gt;.  This space is a fibration in two different ways:

1) Project onto the first factor: &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_G EG \to M_p/G = N&lt;/math&gt;. The fibre in this case is &lt;math&gt;EG&lt;/math&gt;, which is a contractible space by the definition of a classifying space. 

2) Project onto the second factor: &lt;math&gt;M_p \times_G EG \to EG/G = BG&lt;/math&gt;.  The fibre in this case is &lt;math&gt;M_p&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have a fibration &lt;math&gt;M_p \to N \simeq M_p\times_G EG \to BG&lt;/math&gt;.  This map is called the '''classifying map''' of the fibre bundle &lt;math&gt;p \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; since 1) the principal bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to M_p \to N&lt;/math&gt; is the pull-back of the bundle &lt;math&gt;G \to EG \to BG&lt;/math&gt; along the classifying map and 2) The bundle &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is induced from the principal bundle as above.

===Contrast with twisted spheres===
{{see also|Twisted sphere}}
[[Twisted sphere]]s are sometimes referred to as a "clutching-type" construction, but this is misleading: the clutching construction is properly about fiber bundles.

* In twisted spheres, you glue two ''disks'' along their boundary. The disks are ''a priori'' identified (with the standard disk), and points on the boundary sphere do not in general go to their corresponding points on the other boundary sphere. This is a map &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;: the gluing is non-trivial in the base.
* In the clutching construction, you glue two ''bundles'' together over the boundary of their base disks. The boundary spheres are glued together via the standard identification: each point goes to the corresponding one, but each fiber has a twist. This is a map &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \to G&lt;/math&gt;: the gluing is trivial in the base, but not in the fibers.

{{about|computer science|the use of this term in medicine and anaesthesia|coinduction (anaesthetics)}}

In [[computer science]], '''coinduction''' is a technique for defining and proving properties of systems of concurrent interacting [[object (computing)|object]]s.

Coinduction is the [[mathematic]]al [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[structural induction]].  Coinductively defined types are known as '''codata''' and are typically [[Infinity|infinite]] [[data structures]], such as [[stream (computing)|streams]].

As a definition or [[specification (computing)|specification]], coinduction describes how an object may be "observed", "broken down" or "destructed" into simpler objects. As a [[proof (math)|proof]] technique, it may be used to show that an equation is satisfied by all possible [[implementation (computing)|implementation]]s of such a specification.

To generate and manipulate codata, one typically uses [[corecursion|corecursive]] functions, in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]].  Informally, rather than defining a function by pattern-matching on each of the inductive constructors, one defines each of the "destructors" or "observers" over the function result.

In programming, co-logic programming (co-LP for brevity) "is a natural generalization of logic programming and coinductive logic programming, which in turn generalizes other extensions of logic programming, such as infinite trees, lazy predicates, and concurrent communicating predicates. Co-LP has applications to rational trees, verifying infinitary properties, lazy evaluation, concurrent logic programming, model checking, bisimilarity proofs, etc."&lt;ref&gt;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2513&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental implementations of co-LP are available from [[The University of Texas at Dallas]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Logtalk]] (for examples see  &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/coinduction&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[SWI-Prolog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">The '''contorsion tensor''' in [[differential geometry]] is the difference between a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] with and without [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] in it.  It commonly appears in the study of [[spin connection]]s. Thus, for example, a [[vielbein]] together with a spin connection, when subject to the condition of vanishing torsion, gives a description of Einstein gravity. For [[supersymmetry]], the same constraint, of vanishing torsion, gives (the field equations of) 11-dimensional [[supergravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Urs Schreiber, "[https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/11d-gravity-just-torsion-constraint/ 11d Gravity From Just the Torsion Constraint]" (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the contorsion tensor, along with the connection, becomes one of the dynamical objects of the theory, demoting the metric to a secondary, derived role.

The elimination of torsion in a connection is referred to as the ''absorption of torsion'', and is one of the steps of [[Cartan's equivalence method]] for establishing the equivalence of geometric structures.

==Metric geometry==
In [[metric geometry]], the contorsion tensor expresses the difference between a [[Metric_connection#Metric_compatibility|metric-compatible]]  [[affine connection]] with [[Christoffel symbol]] &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{ij}{}^k&lt;/math&gt;  and the unique torsion-free [[Levi-Civita connection]] for the same metric.

The contorsion tensor &lt;math&gt;{K_{ab}}^c&lt;/math&gt; is defined in terms of the [[torsion tensor]] &lt;math&gt;{T_{ij}}^k= {\Gamma_{ij}}^k -{\Gamma_{ji}}^k &lt;/math&gt; as 

:&lt;math&gt;K_{ijk}= \frac{1}{2} (T_{ijk} - T_{jki} + T_{kij}  ),&lt;/math&gt;

where  the indices  are being raised and lowered with respect to the metric:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{ijk} \equiv  g_{kl} {T_{ij}}^l&lt;/math&gt;.

The reason for the non-obvious sum in the definition  is that   the  contorsion tensor, being  the difference between two metric-compatible Christoffel symbols, must be   antisymmetric in the last two indices, whilst the torsion tensor itself is antisymmetric in its first two indices.

The  connection can now be written as 

:&lt;math&gt; {\Gamma_{kj}}^i =\bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i + {K_{kj}}^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; is the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.

It can be shown that the geodesics for both connections are the same: that is, the any geodesic of &lt;math&gt; \bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; is also a geodesic of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; and ''vice-versa''.

==Affine geometry==
In [[affine geometry]], one does not have a metric nor a metric connection, and so one is not free raise and lower indices on demand. One can still achieve a similar effect by making use of the [[solder form]], allowing the bundle to be related to what is happening on its base space. This is an explicitly geometric viewpoint, with tensors now being geometric objects in the [[vertical and horizontal bundles]] of a [[fiber bundle]], instead of being indexed algebraic objects defined only on the base space. In this case, one may construct a contorsion tensor, living as a [[one-form]] on the tangent bundle. 

Recall that the [[torsion form|torsion]] of a connection &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_\omega = D\theta = d\theta + \omega \wedge \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solder form]] ([[tautological one-form]]). The subscript &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; serves only as a reminder that this torsion tensor was obtained from the connection.

That is, one may construct a tensor 
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\omega(X,Y,Z)=\langle\theta(Z), \Theta_\omega(X,Y)\rangle +
\langle\theta(Y), \Theta_\omega(Z,X)\rangle 
- \langle\theta(X), \Theta_\omega(Y,Z)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\langle,\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar product. This tensor can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;David Bleecker, "[https://zulfahmed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/88623149-bleecker-d-gauge-theory-and-variational-principles-aw-1981-ka-t-201s-pqgf.pdf Gauge Theory and Variational Principles]" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing ''(See theorem 6.2.5)''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\omega(X,Y,Z)=2\langle\theta(Z), \sigma_\omega(X)\theta(Y)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the '''contorsion form''' and is ''exactly'' what is needed to add to an arbitrary connection to get the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.  That is, given an [[Ehresmann connection]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, there is another connection &lt;math&gt;\omega+\sigma_\omega&lt;/math&gt; that is torsion-free.

The vanishing of the torsion is then equivalent to having 

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_{\omega+\sigma_\omega} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;d\theta = - (\omega +\sigma_\omega) \wedge \theta&lt;/math&gt;

This can be viewed as a [[field equation]] relating the dynamics of the connection to that of the contorsion tensor.

==Relationship to teleparallelism==
In the theory of [[teleparallelism]], one encounters a connection, the Weitzenböck connection, which is flat (vanishing Riemann curvature) but has a non-vanishing torsion. The flatness is exactly what allows parallel frame fields to be constructed. These notions can be extended to [[supermanifold]]s.&lt;ref name="dewitt"&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', (1984) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}} ''(See the subsection "distant parallelism" of section 2.7.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[crystallography]], '''crystal structure''' is a description of the ordered arrangement of [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s in a [[crystal|crystalline material]].&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Solid State Physics |edition=2nd |first1=J.R. |last1=Hook |first2=H.E. |last2=Hall |series=Manchester Physics Series |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2010 |isbn=9780471928041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three-dimensional space]] in matter.

The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes the repeating pattern is the '''unit cell''' of the structure. The unit cell completely defines the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal lattice, which is built up by repetitive [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] of the unit cell along its principal axes.  The repeating patterns are said to be located at the points of the [[Bravais lattice]].

The lengths of the principal axes, or edges, of the unit cell and the angles between them are the [[lattice constant]]s, also called ''lattice parameters''. The [[symmetry]] properties of the crystal are described by the concept of [[space group]]s.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt; All possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space may be described by the 230 [[space groups]].

The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties, such as [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[electronic band structure]], and [[crystal optics|optical transparency]].

== Unit cell ==
Crystal structure is described in terms of the geometry of arrangement of particles in the unit cell. The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Solid State Chemistry |first=Anthony R. |last=West |publisher=Wiley |edition=2nd |date=1999 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-471-98756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a [[parallelepiped]], providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') and the angles between them (α, β, γ).  The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the [[fractional coordinates]] (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is only necessary to report the coordinates of a smallest asymmetric subset of particles. This group of particles may be chosen so that it occupies the smallest physical space, which means that not all particles need to be physically located inside the boundaries given by the lattice parameters. All other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the [[space group]] of the crystal structure.&lt;ref name="Space-group symmetry"&gt;International Tables for Crystallography (2006). Volume A, Space-group symmetry.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miller indices ===
[[File:Miller Indices Cubes.svg|thumb|250px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]
Vectors and planes in a crystal lattice are described by the three-value [[Miller index]] notation. This syntax uses the indices ''ℓ'', ''m'', and ''n'' as directional orthogonal parameters, which are separated by 90°.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the syntax (''ℓmn'') denotes a plane that intercepts the three points ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''ℓ'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''m'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'', or some multiple thereof. That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell (in the basis of the lattice vectors). If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (i.e., the intercept is "at infinity"). A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined. The Miller indices for a plane are [[integer]]s with no common factors. Negative indices are indicated with horizontal bars, as in (1{{overbar|2}}3). In an orthogonal coordinate system for a cubic cell, the Miller indices of a plane are the Cartesian components of a vector normal to the plane.

Considering only (''ℓmn'') planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the ''lattice planes''), the distance ''d'' between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) [[reciprocal lattice]] vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2\pi}  {|\mathbf{g}_{\ell m n}|}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Planes and directions ===
The crystallographic directions are geometric [[line (mathematics)|line]]s linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Likewise, the crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s are geometric ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes. These high density planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal as follows:&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt;

*[[optics|Optical properties]]: [[Refractive index]] is directly related to density (or periodic density fluctuations).
*[[Adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: Physical adsorption and chemical reactions occur at or near surface atoms or molecules. These phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes.
*[[Surface tension]]: The condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species. The surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface.

[[File:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|300px|Dense crystallographic planes]]

*Microstructural [[Crystallographic defect|defects]]: [[sintering|Pores]] and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following higher density planes.
*[[cleavage (crystal)|Cleavage]]: This typically occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes.
*[[Plastic deformation]]: [[Dislocation]] glide occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes. The perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction. The shift of one node in a more dense direction requires a lesser distortion of the crystal lattice.

Some directions and planes are defined by symmetry of the crystal system. In monoclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and trigonal/hexagonal systems there is one unique axis (sometimes called the '''principal axis''') which has higher [[rotational symmetry]] than the other two axes. The '''basal plane''' is the plane perpendicular to the principal axis in these crystal systems. For triclinic, orthorhombic, and cubic crystal systems the axis designation is arbitrary and there is no principal axis.

==== Cubic structures ====
For the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted ''a''); similarly for the reciprocal lattice. So, in this common case, the Miller indices (''ℓmn'') and [''ℓmn''] both simply denote normals/directions in [[Cartesian coordinates]]. For cubic crystals with [[lattice constant]] ''a'', the spacing ''d'' between adjacent (ℓmn) lattice planes is (from above):
:&lt;math&gt;d_{\ell mn}= \frac {a} { \sqrt{\ell ^2 + m^2 + n^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:

*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' such as {{angbr|100}} denote a ''family'' of directions that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.
*Coordinates in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as {100} denote a family of plane normals that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

For [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) and [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal. However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic [[supercell (crystal)|supercell]] and hence are again simply the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian directions]].

===Interplanar spacing===
The spacing '''''d''''' between adjacent (''hkl'') lattice planes is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4. Direct and reciprocal lattices |website=CSIC Dept de Cristalografia y Biologia Estructural |url= http://www.xtal.iqfr.csic.es/Cristalografia/parte_04-en.html |date=6 Apr 2017 |access-date=18 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cubic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2+l^2} {a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Tetragonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2} {a^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Hexagonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{h^2+hk+k^2}{a^2}\right)+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Rhombohedral:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\sin^2\alpha+2(hk+kl+hl)(\cos^2\alpha-\cos\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\cos^2\alpha+2\cos^3\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Orthorhombic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Monoclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}=\left(\frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2\sin^2\beta}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}-\frac{2hl\cos\beta}{ac}\right) \csc^2\beta&lt;/math&gt;
*Triclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{\frac{h^2}{a^2}\sin^2\alpha+\frac{k^2}{b^2}\sin^2\beta+\frac{l^2}{c^2}\sin^2\gamma+\frac{2kl}{bc}\cos\alpha+\frac{2hl}{ac}\cos\beta+\frac{2hk}{ab}\cos\gamma}{1-\cos^2\alpha-\cos^2\beta-\cos^2\gamma+2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

== Classification by symmetry ==
{{main|Crystal system}}
The defining property of a crystal is its inherent symmetry, by which we mean that under certain 'operations' the crystal remains unchanged. All crystals have translational symmetry in three directions, but some have other symmetry elements as well. For example, rotating the crystal 180° about a certain axis may result in an atomic configuration that is identical to the original configuration. The crystal is then said to have a twofold rotational symmetry about this axis. In addition to rotational symmetries like this, a crystal may have symmetries in the form of mirror planes and [[translational symmetries]], and also the so-called "compound symmetries," which are a combination of translation and rotation/mirror symmetries. A full classification of a crystal is achieved when all of these inherent symmetries of the crystal are identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N.|author-link1=Neil Ashcroft|last2=Mermin|first2=D.|authorlink2=David Mermin|date=1976|title=Solid State Physics|publisher=Brooks/Cole (Thomson Learning, Inc.)|chapter=Chapter 7|isbn=978-0030493461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[lattice system]]s are a grouping of crystal structures according to the axial system used to describe their lattice. Each lattice system consists of a set of three axes in a particular geometric arrangement. There are seven lattice systems. They are similar to but not quite the same as the seven [[crystal system]]s.

{{clear}}
The simplest and most symmetric, the [[cubic (crystal system)|cubic]] (or isometric) system, has the symmetry of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], that is, it exhibits four threefold rotational axes oriented at 109.5° (the [[tetrahedral angle]]) with respect to each other. These threefold axes lie along the body diagonals of the cube. The other six lattice systems, are [[Hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]], [[tetragonal]], [[rhombohedral lattice system|rhombohedral]] (often confused with the [[trigonal crystal system]]), [[orthorhombic]], [[monoclinic]] and [[triclinic]].

==== Bravais lattices ====
{{main|Bravais lattice}}
Bravais lattices, also referred to as ''space lattices'', describe the geometric arrangement of the lattice points,&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; and therefore the translational symmetry of the crystal. The three dimensions of space afford 14 distinct Bravais lattices describing the translational symmetry. All crystalline materials recognized today, not including [[quasicrystal]]s, fit in one of these arrangements. The fourteen three-dimensional lattices, classified by lattice system, are shown above.

The crystal structure consists of the same group of atoms, the ''basis'', positioned around each and every lattice point. This group of atoms therefore repeats indefinitely in three dimensions according to the arrangement of one of the Bravais lattices. The characteristic rotation and mirror symmetries of the unit cell is described by its [[crystallographic point group]].

===Crystal systems===
A crystal system is a set of point groups in which the point groups themselves and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case the crystal system and lattice system both have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both lattice systems exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system.

{{clear}}
In total there are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

==== Point groups ====
{{main|Crystallographic point group}}
The crystallographic point group or ''crystal class'' is the mathematical group comprising the symmetry operations that leave at least one point unmoved and that leave the appearance of the crystal structure unchanged. These symmetry operations include

*''Reflection'', which reflects the structure across a ''reflection plane''
*''Rotation'', which rotates the structure a specified portion of a circle about a ''rotation axis''
*''Inversion'', which changes the sign of the coordinate of each point with respect to a ''center of symmetry'' or ''inversion point''
*''[[Improper rotation]]'', which consists of a rotation about an axis followed by an inversion.

Rotation axes (proper and improper), reflection planes, and centers of symmetry are collectively called ''symmetry elements''. There are 32 possible crystal classes. Each one can be classified into one of the seven crystal systems.

=== Space groups ===
{{main|Space group}}
In addition to the operations of the point group, the space group of the crystal structure contains translational symmetry operations. These include:
*Pure ''translations'', which move a point along a vector
*''Screw axes'', which rotate a point around an axis while translating parallel to the axis.&lt;ref name=Sands&gt;
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Crystallography |author=Donald E. Sands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_A5u5sczJoC&amp;pg=PA71 |chapter=§4-2 Screw axes and §4-3 Glide planes |pages= 70–71 |isbn=978-0486678399 |publisher=Courier-Dover |year=1994 |edition=Reprint of WA Benjamin corrected 1975}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Glide planes'', which reflect a point through a plane while translating it parallel to the plane.&lt;ref name=Sands/&gt;

There are 230 distinct space groups.

== Atomic coordination ==
By considering the arrangement of atoms relative to each other, their coordination numbers (or number of nearest neighbors), interatomic distances, types of bonding, etc., it is possible to form a general view of the structures and alternative ways of visualizing them.&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"&gt;{{cite book|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics |edition=2nd |editor1-first=C.B. |editor1-last=Parker |date=1994 |isbn=978-0070514003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close packing ===
[[File:close packing.svg|thumb|right|341px|The hcp lattice (left) and the fcc lattice (right)]]
The principles involved can be understood by considering the most efficient way of packing together equal-sized spheres and stacking [[close-packed]] atomic planes in three dimensions. For example, if plane A lies beneath plane B, there are two possible ways of placing an additional atom on top of layer B. If an additional layer was placed directly over plane A, this would give rise to the following series:
:...'''ABABABAB'''...
This arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure is known as '''hexagonal close packing (hcp)'''.

If, however, all three planes are staggered relative to each other and it is not until the fourth layer is positioned directly over plane A that the sequence is repeated, then the following sequence arises:
:...'''ABCABCABC'''...
This type of structural arrangement is known as '''cubic close packing (ccp)'''.

The unit cell of a ccp arrangement of atoms is the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. This is not immediately obvious as the closely packed layers are parallel to the {111} planes of the fcc unit cell. There are four different orientations of the close-packed layers.

The '''packing efficiency''' can be worked out by calculating the total volume of the spheres and dividing by the volume of the cell as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{16 \sqrt{2} r^3} = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}} = 0.7405...&lt;/math&gt;

The 74% packing efficiency is the maximum density possible in unit cells constructed of spheres of only one size. Most crystalline forms of metallic elements are hcp, fcc, or bcc (body-centered cubic). The [[coordination number]] of atoms in hcp and fcc structures is 12 and its [[atomic packing factor]] (APF) is the number mentioned above, 0.74. This can be compared to the APF of a bcc structure, which is 0.68.

== Grain boundaries ==
Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; A [[grain boundary]] is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term "crystallite boundary" is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, [[dislocations]], and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.

Treating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the [[Hall–Petch]] relationship. Since grain boundaries are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of the material. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of [[creep (deformation)|creep]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries are in general only a few nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as [[diffusion]] and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an [[amorphous solid]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

== Defects and impurities ==
Real crystals feature [[crystallographic defect|defects]] or irregularities in the ideal arrangements described above and it is these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes for one of the principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nikola |last=Kallay |date=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXsBk20WO1sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Interfacial Dynamics |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0824700065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] [[alloy]]s may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|title = Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|year = 1969|author = Hogan, C.

== Prediction of structure ==
{{Main| Crystal structure prediction}}
[[File:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|Crystal structure of sodium chloride (table salt)]]
The difficulty of predicting stable crystal structures based on the knowledge of only the chemical composition has long been a stumbling block on the way to fully computational materials design. Now, with more powerful algorithms and high-performance computing, structures of medium complexity can be predicted using such approaches as [[evolutionary algorithms]], random sampling, or metadynamics.

The crystal structures of simple ionic solids (e.g., NaCl or table salt) have long been rationalized in terms of [[Pauling's rules]], first set out in 1929 by [[Linus Pauling]], referred to by many since as the "father of the chemical bond".&lt;ref name="Paulingsrules"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Linus Pauling|L. Pauling]]|year = 1929|title = The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals|journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|volume = 51|issue = 4|pages= 1010–1026|doi= 10.1021/ja01379a006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauling also considered the nature of the interatomic forces in metals, and concluded that about half of the five d-orbitals in the transition metals are involved in bonding, with the remaining nonbonding d-orbitals being responsible for the magnetic properties. He, therefore, was able to correlate the number of d-orbitals in bond formation with the bond length as well as many of the physical properties of the substance. He subsequently introduced the metallic orbital, an extra orbital necessary to permit uninhibited resonance of valence bonds among various electronic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.54.899|title=The Nature of the Interatomic Forces in Metals|year=1938|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|journal=Physical Review|volume=54|issue=11|pages=899-904|bibcode = 1938PhRv...54..899P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[resonating valence bond theory]], the factors that determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability is associated with the simplest ratios or "bond numbers": {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|2|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, etc. The choice of structure and the value of the [[axial ratio]] (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01195a024|year=1947|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|title=Atomic Radii and Interatomic Distances in Metals|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=69|issue=3|pages=542-553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1949.0032|title=A Resonating-Valence-Bond Theory of Metals and Intermetallic Compounds|year=1949|last1=Pauling|first1=L.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=196|issue=1046|pages=343-362|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.196..343P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After postulating a direct correlation between electron concentration and crystal structure in beta-phase alloys, [[Hume-Rothery]] analyzed the trends in melting points, compressibilities and bond lengths as a function of group number in the periodic table in order to establish a system of valencies of the transition elements in the metallic state. This treatment thus emphasized the increasing bond strength as a function of group number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1951.0172|title=The Valencies of the Transition Elements in the Metallic State|year=1951|last1=Hume-rothery|first1=W.|first2=H. M.|first3=R. J. P.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=208|issue=1095|pages=431|last2=Irving|last3=Williams|bibcode = 1951RSPSA.208..431H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of directional forces were emphasized in one article on the relation between bond hybrids and the metallic structures. The resulting correlation between electronic and crystalline structures is summarized by a single parameter, the weight of the d-electrons per hybridized metallic orbital. The "d-weight" calculates out to 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for the fcc, hcp and bcc structures respectively. The relationship between d-electrons and crystal structure thus becomes apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1957.0073|title=On the Relation between Bond Hybrids and the Metallic Structures|year=1957|last1=Altmann|first1=S.

In crystal structure predictions/simulations, the periodicity is usually applied, since the system is imagined as unlimited big in all directions. Starting from a triclinic structure with no further symmetry property assumed, the system may be driven to show some additional symmetry properties by applying Newton's Second Law on particles in the unit cell and a recently developed dynamical equation for the system period vectors
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/cjp-2014-0518|title=Dynamical equations for the period vectors in a periodic system under constant external stress|year=2015|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|journal=[[Can. J. Phys.]]| volume=93| issue=9| pages=974-978|bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..974L |arxiv=cond-mat/0209372}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lattice parameters including angles), even if the system is subject to external stress.

== Polymorphism ==
[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Quartz]] is one of the several [[crystalline]] forms of [[silica]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The most important forms of silica include: [[quartz|α-quartz]], [[quartz|β-quartz]], [[tridymite]], [[cristobalite]], [[coesite]], and [[stishovite]].]]
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the occurrence of multiple crystalline forms of a material. It is found in many crystalline materials including [[polymer]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s.  According to Gibbs' rules of phase equilibria, these unique crystalline phases are dependent on intensive variables such as pressure and temperature.  Polymorphism is related to [[allotropy]], which refers to [[chemical elements|elemental solids]]. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as [[crystal habit]], [[Amorphous solid|amorphous fraction]] or [[crystallographic defect]]s. Polymorphs have different stabilities and may spontaneously convert from a metastable form (or thermodynamically unstable form) to the [[stable]] form at a particular temperature. They also exhibit different [[melting points]], solubilities, and [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns.

One good example of this is the [[quartz]] form of [[silicon dioxide]], or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the vast majority of [[silicates]], the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. All but one of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of networking and polymerization. For example, they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these structures. In each of the 7 thermodynamically stable crystalline forms or polymorphs of crystalline quartz, only 2 out of 4 of each the edges of the {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula for silica: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another example is elemental [[tin]] (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is [[brittle]] when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence of its two major [[allotrope]]s, α- and β-tin. The two [[allotrope]]s that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as ''gray tin'' and ''white tin'' respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures above several GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = A. M.|last = Molodets|author2=Nabatov, S. S.|title = Thermodynamic Potentials, Diagram of State, and Phase Transitions of Tin on Shock Compression|journal = High Temperature|volume = 38|issue = 5|year = 2000|pages = 715–721|doi = 10.1007/BF02755923}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a [[diamond cubic]] crystal structure, similar to [[diamond]], [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized [[semiconductor]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|issue = |pages = 793–800|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman |author2=Wiberg, Egon |author3=Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Tin| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Mel|last = Schwartz |title = Encyclopedia of Materials, Parts and Finishes|edition = 2nd|chapter = Tin and Alloys, Properties|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2002|isbn= 978-1-56676-661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
Twenty of the 32 crystal classes are [[piezoelectric]], and crystals belonging to one of these classes (point groups) display [[piezoelectricity]]. All piezoelectric classes lack a center of symmetry. Any material develops a [[dielectric]] polarization when an electric field is applied, but a substance that has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are [[polar point group|polar]]. All polar crystals are [[pyroelectric]], so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.

There are a few crystal structures, notably the [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite structure]], which exhibit [[ferroelectric]] behavior. This is analogous to [[ferromagnetism]], in that, in the absence of an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).

'''Cyberbullying''' or '''cyberharassment''' is a form of [[bullying]] or [[harassment]] using electronic means. Cyberbullying and Cyberharassment are also known as '''online bullying'''. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x|pmid=18363945 |volume=49|issue=4|pages=376–385|year=2008|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K.|last2=Mahdavi|first2=Jess|last3=Carvalho|first3=Manuel|last4=Fisher|first4=Sonja|last5=Russell|first5=Shanette|last6=Tippett|first6=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying is when someone, typically teens, bully or harass others on social media sites.  Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, [[threats]], sexual remarks, a [[Doxing|victims' personal information]], or pejorative labels (i.e., [[hate speech]]).&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com" /&gt; Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased [[suicidal ideation]], and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;

Awareness in the United States has risen in the [[2010s]], due in part to high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/nyregion/02suicide.html?_r=0|title=Legal Debate Swirls Over Charges in a Student's Suicide|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=1 October 2010|work=New York Times|access-date=1 December 2016|publisher=|others=Nate Schweber|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapin|first=John|date=2014-08-17|title=Adolescents and Cyber Bullying: The Precaution Adoption Process Model|journal=Education and Information Technologies|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=719–728|doi=10.1007/s10639-014-9349-1|issn=1360-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several US states and other countries have laws specific to cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others use laws extending from the scope of physical harassment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;

[[Internet troll]]ing is a common form of bullying over the Internet in an [[online community]] (such as in [[Online game|online gaming]] or [[social media]]) in order to elicit a reaction, disruption, or for someone's own personal amusement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts" /&gt; Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in [[peer pressure]], which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Gwenn Schurgin|last2=Clarke-Pearson|first2=Kathleen|last3=Media|first3=Council on Communications and|date=2011-04-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/800|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=127|issue=4|pages=800–804|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0054|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21444588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/influence-of-social-media-on-teenagers_b_7427740.html|title=Influence of Social Media on Teenagers|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=2015-05-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-teenage-brain-on-social-media|title=The teenage brain on social media|last=Wolpert|first=Stuart|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
A frequently used definition of cyberbullying is "an aggressive, intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Megan A.|date=2014-05-01|title=Cyberbullying|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=168|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3343|pmid=24791741|issn=2168-6203|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many variations of the definition, such as the [[National Crime Prevention Council]]'s more specific definition: "the process of using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying, with some notable distinctions. Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully, or why the bully is targeting them. The harassment can have wide-reaching effects on the victim, as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettalia|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Levin|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Dickinson|first3=Joël|date=2013-11-01|title=Cyberbullying: Eliciting harm without consequence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213002586|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2758–2765|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "cyberharassment" and "cyberbullying" are sometimes used synonymously, though some people use  the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=735549|title=Protection of Children Online: Federal and State Laws Addressing Cyberstalking, Cyberharassment, and Cyberbullying|last=Smith|first=Alison M.|date=5 September 2008|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|id=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberstalking===
{{further|Cyberstalking}}
Cyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim's safety. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass. They may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trolling ===
{{Further|Internet troll}}
Internet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=Fernando L.|year=2016|title=Trolling &amp; the First Amendment: Protecting Internet Speech in the Era of Cyberbullies &amp; Internet Defamation|url=|journal=University of Illinois Journal of Law, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=|pages=135–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals: while some trolls engage in cyberbullying, others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/what-an-academic-who-wrote-her-dissertation-on-trolls-thinks-of-violentacrez/263631/|title = What an Academic Who Wrote Her Dissertation on Trolls Thinks of Violentacrez|date = October 15, 2012|accessdate = |website = The Atlantic|publisher = |last = Phillips|first = Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuals to educate the public, teachers and parents summarize, "Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material using a cell phone or the internet." Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Research has identified basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* Cyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm.
* Cyberbullying is perpetrated through [[harassment]], [[cyberstalking]], denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), [[impersonation]], and exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110410181159/http://csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf ''An Educator's Guide to Cyberbullying''] Brown Senate.gov, archived from [http://www.csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf the original] on 10 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender. It may also include public actions such as repeated [[threat]]s, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e. [[hate speech]]) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining a Cyberbully|url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121847|publisher=The National Science Foundation|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them.&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com"&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying – Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums—called [[doxing]], or may use [[impersonation]], creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous, which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful.

The recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of types cyberbullying than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Görzig|first=Anke|author2=Lara A. Frumkin|title=Cyberbullying experiences on-the-go: When social media can become distressing|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=7|issue=1|year=2013|url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2013022801&amp;article=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama. Danah Boyd writes, "teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 137). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In social media ===
Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. "By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/millennials/teen-internet-use-graphic/ |title=Teen and Young Adult Internet Use |work=Pew Internet Project |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying, bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies, such as e-mail, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder &amp; Lattanner|first=R. M., G. W.,  A. N.,  M. R.|year=2014|title=Bullying in the digital age: A critical review and meta-analysis of cyberbullying research among youth.|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=4|pages=1073–1137|via=google scholar|doi=10.1037/a0035618|pmid=24512111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year,{{when|date=December 2017}} while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done so frequently. 95 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent have witnessed this frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetsafety101.org/cyberbullyingstatistics.htm |title=Cyberbullying Statistics |work=Internet Safety 101 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes their location, images, and contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |accessdate=15 November 2015|date=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect children, it is important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highya.com/articles-guides/stranger-danger-protecting-your-children-from-cyber-bullying-sexting-and-social-media |title=Stranger Danger: Protecting Your Children from Cyber Bullying, Sexting, &amp; Social Media |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies from 2014 found that 80% of body-shaming [[Twitter|tweets]] are sent by women, while they also accounted for 50% of [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] tweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36380247|title=Twitter abuse - '50% of misogynistic tweets from women'|date=2016-05-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/staggering-scale-of-social-media-misogyny-mapped-in-new-demos-study/|title=New Demos study reveals scale of social media misogyny - Demos|website=www.demos.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
[[File:Gamers Playin expo.jpg|thumb|Harassment in [[gaming culture]] can occur in [[Online game|online gaming]].]]
Of those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game.&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/30/5-facts-about-online-harassment/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=5 facts about online harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Paths to Bullying in Online Gaming: The Effects of Gender, Preference for Playing Violent Games, Hostility, and Aggressive Behavior on Bullying|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|volume=47|issue=3|pages=235–249|doi=10.2190/ec.47.3.a|year=2013|last1=Yang|first1=Shu Ching}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as "duration of playing online games, alcohol consumption in the last 3 months, parents drunk in the last 3 months, anger, hostility, ADHD, and a sense of belonging"&lt;ref&gt;Lam L, Cheng Z and Liu X, 'Violent Online Games Exposure And Cyberbullying/Victimization Among Adolescents' (2013) 16 Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking&lt;/ref&gt; as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying.

Some instances of [[swatting]] in games such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[League of Legends]]'' have resulted in law enforcement [[SWAT]] units called on individuals' homes as a prank.

=== In search engines ===
[[Information cascade]]s happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. This can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes /&gt;

Bullies use [[Google bomb]]s (a term applicable to any search engine){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"]] organized by the [[LGBT]] lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crimes in Cyberspace|last = Citron|first = Danielle|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2014 |location = Cambridge, Mass., USA &amp; London, UK|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wmiABAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==
A majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gregorie|first1=Trudy|title=Cyberstalking: dangers on the information superhighway|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/cyberstalking---dangers-on-the-information-superhighway.pdf?sfvrsn=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx|title=Cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyberbullying|website=NCSL National Conference of State Legislatures|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906024827/http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx|archive-date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.61.260 Cyberstalking] Washington State Legislature&lt;/ref&gt; Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units, and Internet stalking is often treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Back Off, Bully!|url = |last = Bailey|first = Melissa|date = May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Cyberstalking?|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227054307/http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archivedate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Help and resources can be searched by state or area.

=== Schools ===
The safety of schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006–2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000529/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx |date=June 9, 2013 }} Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives and curriclulum requirements also exist in the UK (the [[Ofsted eSafety guidance]]) and Australia ([[Overarching Learning Outcome 13]]).

In 2012, a group of teenagers in a design class [[New Haven, Connecticut]] developed an application to help fight bullying, "Back Off Bully" (BOB). This is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad. When someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening, as well as providing positive action and empowerment regarding the incident. The reported information goes to a database, where it may be studied by administrators. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ CT teens develop bullying app to protect peers] 7 News; June 2012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622100810/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Back Off Bully" is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut, while recent studies carried out among 66 high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/pits.21603 | volume=49| issue=4|year=2012|journal=Psychology in the Schools|pages=352–367 | last1 = Stauffer | first1 = Sterling |title = High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies| last2 = Allen Heath | first2 = Melissa | last3 = Marie Coyne | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Ferrin | first4 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers can also be cyberbullied by pupils,&lt;ref name=durangoherald20151029/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt; as well as by parents and other school staff.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt;

=== Protection ===
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators, as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not yet have laws, and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ The Global Cyber Law Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182226/http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ |date=June 20, 2012 }} GCLD&lt;/ref&gt; Some states such as Florida, California, and Missouri have developed state laws against Cyberbullying. California has the Safe Place to Learn Act and also has a law that states "the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life" can be charged with a misdemeanor which can be punishable to up to one year in prison. In Florida, the "Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act" prohibits any type of bullying and does speak on cyberbullying. In Missouri, anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor, but if the victim is seventeen years or younger,they can be convicted with a Class D felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html|title=Cyberbullying Laws - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===
Children report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Gregg|title=Cyber-bullying defies traditional stereotype: Girls are more likely than boys to engage in this new trend, research suggests|work=Fairfax Times|date=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526084157/http://ww2.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078 |url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078|archivedate=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the bully is male or female, the purpose is to intentionally embarrass, harass, intimidate, or make threats online.

Studies on the psycho-social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect online and offline behavior. Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially  be positive. Victims "created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people."&lt;ref name="cyberpsychology.eu"&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ''Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace'' abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme effects included [[self-harm]]. Children have killed each other and committed [[suicide]] after cyberbullying incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |title=Stop Cyberbullying |publisher=Stop Cyberbullying |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of digital self-harm have been reported, in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|title=Cyberbullying on social networks spawning form of self-harm|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/06/cyberbullying-social-networks-self-harm|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Englander|first=Elizabeth|title=Digital Self-Harm: Frequency, Type, Motivations, and Outcomes|journal=MARC Research Reports|date=June 2012|volume=5|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/marc_reports/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults ===
Cyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/australian_covert_bullying_prevalence_study_chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and may have criminal consequences. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action. Among factors that motivate stalkers are [[envy]], pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life, or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior. The stalker may be [[delusional]] and believe he/she "knows" the target. The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status, or may  believe they can get away with these actions (anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |author=Wayne Petherick |title=Cyber-Stalking:Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal |date=2009 |work=TrueTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209045152/http://trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |archivedate=February 9, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiredsafety.org/subjects/cyberbullying.php Cyberbullying] Stalking and Harassment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/what-cyberbullies-adults-11081994.html What to Do About Cyberbullies: For Adults], by Rena Sherwood; YAHOO Contributor network&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationwide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey (Cross et al., 2009)&lt;ref name="ACBPS"&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Schooling/NationalSafeSchools/Pages/research.aspx Cross, D., Shaw, T., Hearn, L., Epstein, M., Monks, H., Lester, L., &amp; Thomas, L. 2009. Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS). Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Edith Cowan University, Perth]. Deewr.gov.au. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed cyberbullying experiences among 7,418 students. Rates of cyberbullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyberbullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.

=== China ===
In mainland China, cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled 1438 high school students from central China. Data  showed that 34.84% had participated in bullying and 56.88% had been bullied online.&lt;!-- (Commenting this out until it's rewritten in a way that makes sense.)

It is common among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platforms. 58% admitted to changing a nickname for others, 56.3% to humiliation, 54.2% to making fun of someone, and 54.2% to spreading rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 1820 teenagers, 17.5% of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying. This included insults, abuse, and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== European Union ===
In a study published in 2011, across 25 [[European Union|EU]] member states studied, an average 6% of children (9–16 years old) had been bullied and only 3% of them confessed to having been a bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EUKidsOnline/EU%20Kids%20II%20(2009-11)/EUKidsOnlineIIReports/D5%20Patterns%20of%20risk.pdf|title = Patterns of risk and safety online.

=== Finland ===
Sourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were victims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims.

The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but psychosomatic issues. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sourander, A. |author2=Klomek, A.B. |author3=Ikonen, M. |author4=Lindroos, J. |author5=Luntamo, T. |author6=Koskeiainen, M. |author7=Helenius, H. |title=Psychosocial risk factors associated with cyberbullying among adolescents: A population-based study|year=2010|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=7|pages=720–728|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/67/7/720|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.79 |pmid=20603453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you can use this article as a source, or in a sentence that makes a specific point, please feel free to re-include it in the text. Thanks.)The journal article titled "Exploring traditional and cyberbullying among Irish adolescents" studies by --&gt;The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out in eight post-primary schools across Ireland, including 318 students aged 15–18. 59% were boys and 41% were girls. Participation in this survey was voluntary for students, and consent had to be obtained from parents, students and the school itself. This survey was anonymous and confidential, and took 40 minutes to complete. It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying as well as cyberbullying, risk behaviours and self-reported health and [[life satisfaction]].

66% of the students said that they had never been bullied. 14% had been victims of traditional forms of bullying. 10% had been victims of cyberbullying, and the remaining 10% had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. Boys mostly said they were victims of traditional forms of bullying, and girls mostly were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. 20% of the students in this survey said that they had been cyberbullied, showing that cyberbullying is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kelly|first2=Colette|last3=Molcho|first3=Michal|year=2014|title=360 Link|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=60|issue=2|pages=199–206|doi=10.1007/s00038-014-0638-7|pmid=25540816|last1=Callaghan|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study by [[Dublin City University|Dublin City University (DCU)]]'s [[National Anti-Bullying Centre|National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC)]] found that almost 10% of [[Secondary education|post-primary]] teachers were victims of cyberbullying, and 15% knew of a colleague who had experienced it in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/1108/1009482-cyberbullying-teachers/|title=Teachers report high levels of anxiety and stress due to cyberbullying by pupils|author=|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|accessdate=8 November 2018 |date=8 November 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59% of the bullying was by pupils, mainly on social media, with the rest perpetrated by parents and other school staff.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt; Various effects on bullied teachers included increased stress and anxiety, "negative impacts on their working environment, and a reluctance to report the issue and seek help from management".&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt;

=== Japan ===
According to recent{{when|date=December 2017}} research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victims of online bullying. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying. Only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do know the severity of the issue; 63 percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;Cross-Tab Marketing Services &amp; Telecommunications Research Group for Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying may occur via email, text, chat rooms, and social media websites. Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target's images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully's view, and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Marilyn A. (2005). Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?&lt;/ref&gt;

Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sugimori Shinkichi |year=2012 |url=http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00054/|title=Anatomy of Japanese Bullying|work=nippon.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities. One 19-year-old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Cyber-bullying-bedevils-Japan/2007/11/12/1194766557213.html|title=Cyber bullying bedevils Japan|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying. It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end the bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psusd.us/CyberBullying-StudentAwareness Cyber Bullying: Student Awareness] Palm Springs Unified School District Retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Bullying |url=http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224632/http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt; Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007&lt;ref name="patchin2"&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J.

The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.

In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a [[Stanford University]] master's student, created ''[[Adina's Deck]]'', a film based on Stanford-accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.

They also reported findings from a then-recent study of cyberbullying. In a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents reported being cyberbullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported having been cyberbullied at least once in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin pointed out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples.

In 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. Mehari et al. suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression, rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression. They suggest that future research on cyberbullying should be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/psyc_pubs/15/|title = Cyberbullying among adolescents: Measures in search of a construct|last = Mehari|first = Krista|date = 2014|journal = Psychology of Violence|doi = 10.1037/a0037521|pmid = |access-date = March 24, 2015|last2 = Farrell|first2 = Albert|last3 = Le|first3 = Anh-Thuy|volume=4|issue = 4|pages=399–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying on social media has usually been student-to-student, but recently, students have been cyberbullying their teachers. High school students in Colorado created a Twitter site that bullies teachers.

=== Gender ===
Research conducted to try and determine differences in cyber bullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive.  There are some factors that lean towards males being more involved in cyber bullying behaviors due to males tending to have more aggressive behaviors than females.&lt;ref&gt;Uncovering the Structure of and Gender and Developmental Differences in Cyber Bullying.  Cited: Griezel, Lucy, et al. "Uncovering the Structure of and Gender and Developmental Differences in Cyber Bullying." ''Journal of Educational Research'', vol. 105, no. 6, Oct. 2012, pp. 442-455. EBSCO''host'', doi:10.1080/00220671.2011.629692.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not proven but speculated based on literature reviews of research indicating that significant data is self-reported.  Comparatively, the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyber bullying; increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors.

== Legislation ==
{{Main|Cyberstalking legislation}}

=== United States ===
Legislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York, Missouri, Rhode Island and Maryland. At least 45 states have passed laws against digital harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=PÉREZ-PEÑA|first=RICHARD|title=Christie Signs Tougher Law on Bullying in Schools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/nyregion/07bully.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dardenne Prairie of Springfield, Missouri, passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor. The city of St. Charles, Missouri passed a similar ordinance. Missouri is among the states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation, with task forces expected to have cyberbullying laws drafted and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantagraph.com/news/bill-targets-adults-who-cyberbully/article_6ade6d44-a162-54d1-9be0-88bebf181f6d.html Bill targets adults who cyberbully] Pantagraph, by Kevin Mcdermott, December 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9962375-7.html A rallying cry against cyberbullying]. CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to [[Parry Aftab]], but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."

In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. Assembly Bill 86 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbusd.us/vnews/display.v/ART/4cd41cda558da%3C|title=Fort Bragg USD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying, offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerdigitaled.com/edtech/Education-Legislation-Cyber-Bullying.html |title=Education Legislation: Cyber-Bullying |publisher=Centerdigitaled.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/31/AR2008123103067.html|title=States Passing Laws to Combat Cyber-Bullying&amp;nbsp;— washingtonpost.com|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 2, 2009|last=Surdin|first=Ashley | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in ''[[People v. Marquan M.]]''

A recent{{when|date=December 2017}} ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5624 International IT and e-commerce legal info].

While some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts, several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so. By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts, Alvin J. Primack and Kevin A. Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine, particularly the case of ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007), may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech. They concluded, "[w]ithout clearer standards, school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Kevin A.|date=Spring 2017|title=Student cyberbullying inside the digital schoolhouse gate: Toward a standard for determining where a "School" is|journal=First Amendment Studies|volume=51.1|pages=30–48|doi=10.1080/21689725.2016.1278177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

Since the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve [[workplace bullying]] since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier.&lt;ref name=european-perspective&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullying, Harassment and Stress in the Workplace — A European Perspective|url=http://www.internationallaborlaw.com/files/2013/01/Bullying-Harassment-and-Stress-in-the-workplace-A-European-Perspective.pdf|publisher=  Proskauer|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 24-hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries. Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated.

In 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work, a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting his or her employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours. Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from "recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The legislation defines "moral harassment" as "repeated acts leading to a
deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity, the physical or
psychological heath of the victim or his professional career."&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; U.K. courts have used this legislation in bullying cases.

[[File:Take A Stand Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image portrays the support and awareness that many anti-cyberbullying campaigns have in some countries around the world.]]
The United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.

As of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory guidance – Keeping children safe in education|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to help industry promote internet safety|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guidelines-to-help-industry-promote-internet-safety|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education &amp; Tim Loughton|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on preventative legislation ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

Researchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly.&lt;ref name= von&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Von Marees | first1 = N. | last2 = Petermann | first2 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: An increasing challenge for schools | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 33 | issue = 5| page = 476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

Even in a perfect world, no crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. As with any crime, people learn to cope with what has happened. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying. Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying,&lt;ref name= von /&gt; which could allow students to share their stories, and remove the feeling of being alone.

Teachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the "police" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation.&lt;ref name= von /&gt; However, if given the proper tools with preventative measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance. If the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, solutions may be found.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (including terms such as "libel" and "slander"). The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying, nor define it as its own criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, S. M. (2010). Cybercrime in Canadian criminal law. (pp. 105–122). Toronto, ON: Carswell.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed.&lt;ref name= walt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walther | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: Holding grownups liable for negligent entrustment | url = | journal = Houston Law Review | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 531–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and, if charges are pressed, whether this violates the bully's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt; B. Walther said that "Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting." This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt;

'Cyberbullying' is the use of technology to bully a person, or threatening an individual online. Cyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to. The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening. Online bullying has become a bigger problem and 33% of all youth has been a victim of cyberbullying. Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away. Home used to be a safe place for teens but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying- whether it is through YouTube, Ask.fm, or a text message.

Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard, but now they are working to form laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is. They have created movies such as 'Cyberbully' by Charles Biname and 'The Duff' by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual. Parents can become more involved in their children's lives when it comes to social media to help prevent their child from being bullied. Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation. Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well. Suicide has become the 3rd leading cause of death among persons from 10 to 24 years of age and online bullying takes a big part in that.

Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough, but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied. Such as if they post a video or a picture on Instagram with comments like "Am I ugly? Someone said I was but is it true?" or "Am I cute?". A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments. If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign. Being an active parent in their children's lives will make a difference on whether your child is experiencing online bullying or not. Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too.

== Harmful effects ==
Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032718/http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |archivedate=August 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.

Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; The [[suicide of Megan Meier]] is a recent example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a 30-foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK. It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=49|issue=4|page=352|doi=10.1002/pits.21603|year=2012|last1=Stauffer|first1=Sterling|last2=Heath|first2=Melissa Allen|last3=Coyne|first3=Sarah Marie|last4=Ferrin|first4=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from [[mental disorder]]s are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth – there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.&lt;ref name="Guardian8813"&gt;{{cite news|title = Cyberbullying websites should be boycotted, says Cameron: Prime minister calls for website operators to 'step up to the plate', following death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 8 August 2013|author = Alexandra Topping|author2 = Ellen Coyne and agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/article/20120427/CARLYLE0101/304279977/-1/carlyle/cyber-bullying-and-popular-culture|title=Cyber-bullying and popular culture|author=Kelly Running|work=Carlyle Observer|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation, emotional damage, and suicide ===
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high‐profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide – suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression."

Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.&lt;ref name="cyberthreat"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Ideas and Discoveries (magazine)|Ideas and Discoveries]] |title=Cyberthreat: How to protect yourself from online bullying | year=2011 | page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by ''USA Today'' and the ''Baltimore Examiner''. These include the [[suicide of Ryan Halligan]] and the [[suicide of Megan Meier]], the latter of which resulted in ''[[United States v. Lori Drew]]''. Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent. Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as [[Ask.fm]], [[Kik Messenger]] and [[Voxer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=Girl's Suicide Points to Rise in Apps Used by Cyberbullies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/us/suicide-of-girl-after-bullying-raises-worries-on-web-sites.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On youth and teenagers ===
The effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Bullying|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/|website=StopBullying.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, says, "Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber-Bullying and its Effect on our Youth|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/cyber-bullying.aspx|website=American Osteopathic Association|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image shows different aspects of cyberbullying that can take place on the internet which puts more emotional strain on the younger children and teenage who experience cyberbullying.]]

Most of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deniz|first1=Metin|title=A Study on Primary School Students' Being Cyber Bullies and Victims According to Gender, Grade, and Socioeconomic Status|journal=Croatian Journal of Education|date=7 July 2015|volume=17|issue=3|pages=659–680|doi=10.15516/cje.v17i3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will "become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the situation.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;

Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through [[anonymous social media]], perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Odd Girl Out|last=Simmons|first=Rachel|publisher=Mariner Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse on these platforms, such as [[ASKfm]], [[Yik Yak]] and [[Sarahah]], can be particularly keenly felt by young people, leading to issues of loss of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Binns|first=Amy|date=2013|title=Facebook's Ugly Sisters: Anonymity and abuse on Formspring and Ask.fm|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8378/|journal=Media Education Research Journal|volume=4 | issue = 1 |page=27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/family-friends-shocked-at-cyberposts-after-teen-s-death-1.1827393|title=Family and Friends shocked at cyberposts after teen's death|last=Polsky|first=Carol|date=23 March 2010|website=Newsday|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8653867/Teenager-in-rail-suicide-was-sent-abusive-message-on-social-networking-site.html|title=Teenager in rail suicide was sent abusive message on social networking site|last=|first=|date=22 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness ==

=== Campaigns ===

==== International ====
The Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of [[online bullying]], abuse, and hate campaigns. It was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, social isolation, [[self-harm]] and suicides devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, [[Stop Cyberbullying Day]], to draw attention to the issue.

==== Spain ====
Multiple non-profit organizations fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the ''Protégeles'', ''PantallasAmigas'', ''[[Foundation Alia2]]'', the non-profit initiative ''Actúa Contra el Ciberacoso'', the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the ''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', the ''Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta'', the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The government of [[Castile and León]] has also created a ''Plan de Prevención del Ciberacoso y Promoción de la Navegación Segura en Centro Escolares'', and the government of the [[Canary Islands]] has created a portal on the phenomenon called ''Viveinternet''.

==== United States ====
In March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new [[public service advertising]] campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyberbullying.

As of 2008, the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 2008 edition of ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|The Boy Scout Handbook]]'' addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#First Class|First Class]] rank requirements adds: "Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, [[KTTV]] Fox 11 News in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyberbullying on sites like [[Stickam]] by people who call themselves "[[Anonymous (group)|/b/rothas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai09cWlyPrQ|publisher = Fox 11|title = Leelila Strogov – Fox 11 LA – Cyber Bullies|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had put out a report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying, titled "Hackers on Steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY|publisher = Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title = FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous'|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2008, parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, [[Verizon]], MySpace, [[Microsoft]], and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves and their personal reputations, children and businesses from online harassment. Sponsors of the conference included [[McAfee]], [[AOL]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], WiredTrust, Children's Safety Research and Innovation Centre, and KidZui.com. Cyberharassment versus cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference; abusive internet behavior by adults with the repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as [[stalking]] harassment, versus bullying by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Skylar |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2009/10/cal-state-fullerton-student-causes-crash/comment-page-46/ |title=2 dead after head-on collision with CSUF student |publisher=Dailytitan.com |date= 2009-10-26|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organized movement to make [[revenge porn]] illegal began in August 2012: End Revenge Porn.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/|title=End Revenge Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations.  The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org" /&gt;

In 2006, PACER.org created a week-long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a month-long event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzog, J.

Month. Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.stopbullying.gov/blog/2015/10/05/october-national-bullying-prevention-awareness-month&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
Originating in Canada, [[Anti-Bullying Day]] is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colours (pink, blue or purple) as a stance against bullying.  A British Columbia teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.

Pink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland. "We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms – physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)".

ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.

A number of organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for this escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]] launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.

In 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth (BeatBullying), using the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7098978.stm YouTube tackles bullying online] BBC News, November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of [[eBaums World]] began to [[Troll (Internet)|troll]] teens' memorial pages on [[Facebook]], with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salazar|first=Cristian|title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and partnership to the 2011 film ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called the Bully Project was created. Their goal is to start "a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebullyproject.com/|title=The BULLY Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avvakum by Pyotr Yevgenyevich Myasoyedov.jpg|thumb|The "[[baptism]] by fire" of [[Old Believer]] leader [[Avvakum]] in 1682]]

'''Death by burning''' is an execution method involving deliberately causing [[death]] through the effects of [[combustion]] or exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of [[capital punishment]], and many societies have employed it for activities considered criminal such as [[treason]], rebellious actions by slaves, [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[arson]] (in Japan) and sexual transgressions, such as [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]].

The best known executions of this type are those where the condemned is bound to a large wooden stake and a fire lit beneath them. This is usually called '''burning at the stake''', or in some cases, ''[[auto-da-fé]]''. For burnings at the stake, if the fire was large (for instance, when a number of [[prison]]ers were [[executed]] at the same time), death often came from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] before flames actually caused lethal harm to the body. If the fire was small, however, the condemned would burn for some time until death from [[hypovolemia]] (the loss of blood or other fluids, since extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, because the subsequent inflammatory response causes significant capillary fluid leakage and oedema), [[heatstroke]] or the simple [[thermal decomposition]] of vital body parts.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tXywBrmhPTUC&amp;pg=PA67 pp. 67–68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of death resulting from exposure to extreme heat are known. For example, pouring substances such as molten metal onto a person (or down their throat or into their ears), as well as enclosing persons within, or attaching them to, [[brazen bull|metal contraptions]] subsequently heated. Immersion in a heated liquid as a form of execution is considered distinct from death by burning, and classified as [[death by boiling]].

==Historical usage==

===Antiquity===

====Ancient Near East====

=====Old Babylonia=====
The 18th century BC law code promulgated by [[Babylonian King|Babylonian]] king [[Hammurabi]] specifies several crimes in which death by burning was thought appropriate. Looters of houses on fire could be cast into the flames, and priestesses who abandoned cloisters and began frequenting inns and taverns could also be punished by being burnt alive. Furthermore, a man who began committing incest with his mother after the death of his father could be ordered by courts to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Roth'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=awrOHv-gtqQC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ancient Egypt=====
In [[Ancient Egypt]], several incidents of burning alive perceived rebels are attested. For example, [[Senusret I]] (r. 1971–1926&amp;nbsp;BC) is said to have rounded up the rebels in campaign, and burnt them as human torches. Under the civil war flaring under [[Takelot II]] more than a thousand years later, the Crown Prince Osorkon showed no mercy, and burned several rebels alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Wilkinson'' (2011): Senusret I incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169] Osorkon incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA412 p. 412]&lt;/ref&gt; On the statute books, at least, women committing adultery might be burned to death. [[Jon Manchip White]], however, did not think capital judicial punishments were often carried out, pointing to the fact that the [[pharaoh]] had to personally ratify each verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''White'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GVhQ_lDWq0EC&amp;pg=PA167 p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC) asserts that the Egyptians had a particularly terrible punishment for children who murdered their parents: With sharpened reeds, bits of flesh the size of a finger were cut from the criminal's body. Then he was placed on a bed of thorns and burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html 1.77.8], accessed at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html LacusCurtius]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Assyria=====
In the [[Middle Assyrian period]], paragraph 40 in a preserved law text concerns the obligatory unveiled face for the professional prostitute, and the concomitant punishment if she violated that by veiling herself (the way wives were to dress in public):
{{quote|A prostitute shall not be veiled. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her ... and bring her to the palace entrance. ... they shall pour hot pitch over her head.&lt;ref&gt;''Schneider'' (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hHLe60cYBcC&amp;pg=PA154 p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrians]], mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also as proof of their might. For example, Neo-Assyrian King [[Asuhurnasirpal II]] (r. 883–859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Olmstead'' (1918) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1946342 p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned.}}

====Hebraic tradition====
In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 38, [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]] orders [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]]—the widow of his son, living in her father's household—to be burned when she is believed to have become pregnant by an extramarital sexual relation. Tamar saves herself by proving that Judah is himself the father of her child. In the [[Book of Jubilees]], the same story is basically told, with some intriguing differences, according to Caryn A. Reeder. In Genesis, Judah is exercising his patriarchal power at a distance, whereas he and the relatives seem more actively involved in Tamar's impending execution.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeder'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PiNSpBdtsCgC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebraic law, death by burning was prescribed for ten forms of sexual crimes: The imputed crime of Tamar, namely that a married daughter of a priest commits adultery, and nine versions of relationships considered as incestuous, such as having sex with one's own daughter, or granddaughter, but also, for example, to have sex with one's mother-in-law or with one's wife's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Full list in ''Quint'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nEZQXWsXG4C&amp;pg=PA257 p. 257]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mishnah]], the following manner of burning the criminal is described:
{{quote|The obligatory procedure for execution by burning: They immersed him in dung up to his knees, rolled a rough cloth into a soft one and wound it about his neck. One pulled it one way, one the other until he opened his mouth. Thereupon one ignites the (lead) wick and throws it in his mouth, and it descends to his bowels and sears his bowels.}}

That is, the person dies from being fed molten lead.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from ''Ben-Menahem, Edrei, Hecht'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-ZE_BJpJnIC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah is, however, a fairly late collections of laws, from about the 3rd century AD, and scholars believe it ''replaced'' the actual punishment of burning in the old biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;On this view, see for example, ''Zvi Gilat, Lifshitz'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4h8iAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62, footnote 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Rome====
In the 6th century AD collection of the sayings and rulings of the pre-eminent jurists from earlier ages, the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], a number of crimes are regarded as punishable by death by burning. The 3rd century jurist [[Ulpian]], for example, says that enemies of the state, and deserters to the enemy are to be burned alive. His rough contemporary, the juristical writer [[Callistratus (jurist)|Callistratus]] mentions that arsonists are typically burnt, as well as slaves who have conspired against the well-being of their masters (this last also, on occasion, being meted out to free persons of "low rank").&lt;ref&gt;See ''Watson'' (1998) '''Ulpian''', section 48.19.8.2, p. 361. '''Callistratus''', sections 48.19.28.11–12, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment of burning alive arsonists (and traitors) seems to have been particularly ancient; it was included in the [[Twelve Tables]], a mid-5th BC law code, that is, about 700 years prior to the times of Ulpian and Callistratus.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyle'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=x4vekGBc_McC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient reports, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities executed many of the early [[Martyr#In Christianity|Christian martyrs]] by burning. An example of this is the earliest chronicle of a martyrdom, that of [[Polycarp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.iv.iv.html|title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this was by means of the ''[[tunica molesta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]] has an extended description of the tunica molesta, the punishment as meted out by Emperor [[Nero]] as contained in [[Tacitus]] matches the concept. See, for example ''Pagán'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHzMYrWHjVoC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; a flammable tunic:&lt;ref&gt;''Miley'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 pp. 223–224]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemiradski Fackeln.jpg|thumb|[[Nero's Torches]].]]

{{quote|... the Christian, stripped naked, was forced to put on a garment called the tunica molesta, made of papyrus, smeared on both sides with wax, and was then fastened to a high pole, from the top of which they continued to pour down burning pitch and lard, a spike fastened under the chin preventing the excruciated victim from turning the head to either side, so as to escape the liquid fire, until the whole body, and every part of it, was literally clad and cased in flame.}}

In AD 326, [[Constantine the Great]] promulgated a law that increased the penalties for parentally non-sanctioned "abduction" of their girls, and concomitant sexual intercourse/rape. The man would be burnt alive without the possibility of appeal, and the girl would receive the same treatment if she had participated willingly. Nurses who had corrupted their female wards and led them to sexual encounters would have molten lead poured down their throats.&lt;ref&gt;Law text found in ''Pharr'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA244 pp. 244–245] The full law was changed in context to the penalties just 20 years later by Constantine's son, [[Constantius II]], for free citizens aiding and abetting in the abduction, to an unspecified "capital punishment". The full severity of the law was to be kept, however, for slaves. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA245 p. 245], ''ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Constantine also passed a law that said if a woman married her own slave, both would be subjected to capital punishment, the slave by burning.&lt;ref&gt;Law text in [[Codex Justinianus]] 9.11.1, as referred to in ''Winroth, Müller, Sommar'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4smZ4JjGJcsC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 390, Emperor Theodosius issued an edict against male prostitutes and brothels offering such services; those found guilty should be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ritual child sacrifice in Carthage====
{{further|Religion in Carthage}}
[[File:Bardo National Museum tanit.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Tanit with a lion's head]]

Beginning in the early 3rd century BC, Greek and Roman writers have commented on the purported institutionalized [[child sacrifice]] the North African [[Carthaginians]] are said to have performed in honour of the gods [[Baal Hammon]] and [[Tanit]]. The earliest writer, [[Cleitarchus]] is among the most explicit. He says live infants were placed in the arms of a bronze statue, the statue's hands over a brazier, so that the infant slowly rolled into the fire. As it did so, the limbs of the infant contracted and the face was distorted into a sort of laughing grimace, hence called "the act of laughing". Other, later authors such as [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Plutarch]] says the throats of the infants were generally cut, before they were placed in the statue's embrace&lt;ref&gt;On ritual description, Plutarch, and in general, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] On Diodorus, see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support] on phrase "the act of laughing", see for example, ''Decker'' (2001), [http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/uc_decker_carthrel3.htm p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In the vicinity of ancient Carthage, large scale grave yards containing the incinerated remains of infants, typically up to the age of 3, have been found; such graves are called "tophets". However, some scholars have argued that these findings are not evidence of ''systematic'' child sacrifice, and that estimated figures of ancient natural infant mortality (with cremation afterwards and reverent separate burial) might be the real historical basis behind the hostile reporting from non-Carthaginians. A late charge of the imputed sacrifice is found by the North African bishop [[Tertullian]], who says that child sacrifices were still carried out, in secret, in the countryside at his time, 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;'''Generally accepting''' the tradition of child sacrifice, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] '''Generally skeptical''', see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic traditions====
According to [[Julius Caesar]], the ancient [[Celts]] practiced the burning alive of humans in a number of settings. For example, in Book 6, chapter 16, he writes of the Druidic sacrifice of criminals within huge [[Wicker man|wicker frames shaped as men]]:
{{quote|Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of [[Salix viminalis|osiers]] they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the [[oblation]] of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.}}

Slightly later, in Book 6, chapter 19, Caesar also says the Celts perform, on the occasion of death of great men, the funeral sacrifice on the pyre of living [[slaves]] and dependants ascertained to have been "beloved by them". Earlier on, in Book 1, chapter 4, he relates of the conspiracy of the nobleman [[Orgetorix]], charged by the Celts for having planned a ''coup d'état'', for which the customary penalty would be burning to death. It is said Orgetorix committed suicide to avoid that fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Julius Caesar, McDevitt, Bohn'' (1851) '''On penalty for conspiracy''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4] '''On criminals in large wicker frames''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149] '''On funeral human sacrifice''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=P150 pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice around the Eastern Baltic===
Throughout the 12th–14th centuries, a number of non-Christian peoples living around the Eastern [[Baltic Sea]], such as [[Old Prussians]] and [[Lithuanians]] were charged by Christian writers with performing human sacrifice. For example, [[Pope Gregory IX]] issued a [[papal bull]] denouncing an alleged practice among the Prussians, that girls were dressed in fresh flowers and wreaths and were then burned alive as offerings to evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;This case, and a number of others in ''Pluskowski'' (2013), pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8NykshHHesC&amp;pg=PA77 77–78]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian states===
[[File:Filip2 albigensti.jpg|thumb|The burning of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] heretics]]

====Eastern Roman Empire====
Under 6th-century emperor [[Justinian I]], the death penalty had been decreed for impenitent [[Manicheans]], but a specific punishment was not made explicit. By the 7th century, however, those found guilty of "dualist heresy" could risk being burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton, Hamilton, Stoyanov'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uH-8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13, footnote 42]&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of performing magical rites, and corrupting sacred objects in the process, might face death by burning, as evidenced in a 7th-century case.&lt;ref&gt;''Haldon'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA333 p. 333, footnote 22]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century AD, the Byzantines instituted death by burning for [[parricides]], i.e. those who had killed their own relatives, replacing the older punishment of ''[[poena cullei]]'', the stuffing of the convict in a leather sack along with a rooster, a viper, a dog and a monkey, and then throwing the sack into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Trenchard-Smith, Turner'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ombkgpGt_AC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48, footnote 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval Inquisition and the burning of heretics====
[[File:Templars Burning.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of the [[Knights Templar]], 1314]]

Civil authorities burned persons judged to be [[Heresy|heretics]] under the [[medieval]] [[Inquisition]].  Burning heretics had become customary practice in the latter half of the twelfth century in continental Europe, and death by burning became ''statutory'' punishment from the early 13th century. Death by burning for heretics was made positive law by [[Pedro II of Aragon]] in 1197. In 1224, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], made burning a legal alternative, and in 1238, it became the principal punishment in the Empire. In Sicily, the punishment was made law in 1231, whereas in France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] made it binding law in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/folkwaysastudys01sumngoog|title=Folkways|first=William Graham|last=Sumner|date=26 November 1979|publisher=New York : Arno Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As England in the 15th century grew weary of the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollards]], kings, priests, and parliaments reacted with fire. In 1401, Parliament passed the [[De heretico comburendo]] act, which can be loosely translated as "Regarding the burning of heretics." Lollard persecution would continue for over a hundred years in England. The [[Fire and Faggot Parliament]] met in May 1414 at [[Grey Friars Priory]] in [[Leicester]] to lay out the notorious [[Suppression of Heresy Act 1414]], enabling the burning of heretics by making the crime enforceable by the [[Justices of the peace]]. [[John Oldcastle]], a prominent Lollard leader, was not saved from the gallows by his old friend [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Oldcastle was hanged and his gallows burned in 1417. [[Jan Hus]] was burned at the stake after being accused at the Roman Catholic [[Council of Constance]] (1414–18) of heresy. The ecumenical council also decreed that the remains of [[John Wycliffe]], dead for 30 years, should be exhumed and burned. (This [[posthumous execution]] was carried out in 1428.)

====Burnings of Jews====
[[File:Jews burned to death in Strasbourg Feb. 14 1349 during the Black Death.jpg|thumb|Jews burned to death in the Strasbourg massacre]]

Several incidents are recorded of massacres on Jews from the 12th through 16th centuries in which they were burned alive, often on account of the [[blood libel]]. In 1171 in [[Blois]], for example, 51 Jews were burned alive (the entire adult community). In 1191, King [[Philip Augustus]] ordered around 100 Jews burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Both incidents in ''Weiss'' (2004), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=oJOvpkHg7msC |page=104 }} p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt; That Jews purportedly performed [[host desecration]] also led to mass burnings; In 1243 in [[Beelitz]], the entire Jewish community was burnt alive, and in 1510 in Berlin, some 26 Jews were burnt alive for the same crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Prager, Telushkin'' (2007), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VK0llzUqQ2YC |page=87 }} p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; During the "[[Black Death]]" in the mid-14th century a spate of large-scale [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|massacres]] occurred. One libel was that the Jews had [[well poisoning|poisoned the wells]]. In 1349, as panic grew along with the increasing death toll from the plague, general massacres, but also specifically mass burnings, began to occur. Six hundred (600) Jews were burnt alive in [[Basel]] alone. A large mass burning occurred in [[Strasbourg]], where several hundred Jews were burnt alive in what became known as the [[Strasbourg massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (2005)  [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6uK5pa3R4d8C |page=203 |title=Codex Judaica: Chronological Index of Jewish History, Covering 5,764 Years of Biblical, Talmudic &amp; Post-Talmudic History }} p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish male, Johannes Pfefferkorn, met a particularly gruesome death in 1514 in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. He had been charged with a number of crimes, such as having impersonated a priest for twenty years, performed [[host desecration]], stolen Christian children to be tortured and killed by other Jews, poisoning 13 people and poisoning wells. He was lashed to a pillar in such a way that he could run about it. Then, a ring of glowing coal was made around him, a fiery ring that was gradually pushed ever closer to him, until he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Bülau'' (1860), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z4YBAAAAQAAJ |page=423 }} pp. 423–424]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Lepers' Plot of 1321====
Not only Jews could be victims of mass hysteria on charges like that of poisoning wells. This particular charge, well-poisoning, was the basis for a [[1321 leper scare|large scale hunt of lepers in 1321 France]]. In the spring of 1321, in [[Périgueux]], people became convinced that the local lepers had poisoned the wells, causing ill-health among the normal populace. The lepers were rounded up and burned alive. The action against the lepers didn't stay local, though, but had repercussions throughout France, not least because [[Philip V of France|King Philip V]] issued an order to arrest all lepers, those found guilty to be burnt alive. Jews became tangentially included as well; at [[Chinon]] alone, 160 Jews were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=saXbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 pp. 161–163]&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, around 5000 lepers and Jews are recorded in one tradition to have been killed during the Lepers' Plot hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;''John, Pope'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_fnv5pmECsC&amp;pg=PA177 p. 177]&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge of the lepers' plot was not wholly confined to France; existent records from England show that on [[Jersey]] the same year, at least one family of lepers were burnt alive for having poisoned others.&lt;ref&gt;''Smirke'' (1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=G4dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA326 pp. 326–331]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish Inquisition against Moriscos and Marranos====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy.]]
The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was established in 1478, with the aim of preserving Catholic orthodoxy; some of its principal targets were "[[Marranos]]", formally converted Jews thought to have relapsed into Judaism, or the [[Moriscos]], formally converted Muslims thought to have relapsed into Islam. The public executions of the Spanish Inquisition were called [[autos-da-fé]]; convicts were "released" (handed over) to secular authorities in order to be burnt.

Estimates of how many were executed on behest of the Spanish Inquisition have been offered from early on; historian [[Hernando del Pulgar]] (1436–c. 1492) estimated that 2000 people were burned at the stake between 1478 and 1490.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Kamen]], ''The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision.'', p. 62, (Yale University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000 burnt at the stake (alive or not) at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition during its 300 years of activity have previously been given and are still to be found in popular books.&lt;ref&gt;On mercy, and 50,000 estimate, for Marranos ''Telchin'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K7QH76_HdIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41] On 30,000 estimate of Marranos ''killed'', see ''Pasachoff, Littman'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1481, in what is said to be the first auto-da-fé, six Marranos were burnt alive in [[Seville]]. In November 1481, 298 Marranos were burnt publicly at the same place, their property confiscated by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;These information are included in the appendix, "Historical Notes" to the novel "The Hidden Scroll" ''Anouchi'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pbP-yZL00eAC&amp;pg=PT471 p. 471]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Maranos executed by being burnt at the stake seem to have been burnt alive. If the Jew "confessed his heresy", the Church would show mercy, and he would be strangled prior to the burning. Autos-da-fé against Maranos extended beyond the Spanish heartland. In Sicily, in 1511–15, 79 were burnt at the stake, while from 1511 to 1560, 441 Maranos were condemned to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Cipolla'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sggys-_O-2cC&amp;pg=PA91 p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish American colonies, autos-da-fé were held as well. For example, in 1664, a man and his wife were burned alive in [[Río de la Plata]], and in 1699, a Jew was burnt alive in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman, Zucker'' (1993) '''On the Río de la Plata incident''', see ''Matilde Gini de Barnatan'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144], '''on Mexico City incident''', see ''Eva Alexandra Uchmany'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1535, five Moriscos were burned at the stake on [[Majorca]], the images of a further four were also [[Burn in effigy|burnt in effigy]], since the actual individuals had managed to flee. During the 1540s, some 232 Moriscos were paraded in autos-da-fé in [[Zaragoza]]; five of those were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Carr'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=netlOtzI6R8C&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that out of 917 Moriscos appearing in autos of the Inquisition in [[Granada]] between 1550–95, just 20 were executed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/spanishinquisition2|title=The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision FOURTH EDITION By Henry Kamen|first=|last=Henry Kamen|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems at odds with the English government's state papers which claim that, while at war with Spain, they received a report from Seville of 17 June 1593 that over 70 of the richest men of Granada were burnt.&lt;ref&gt;List And Analysis of State Papers Foreign, Jul 1593 – Dec 1594. v.5; p.444 (595): by Public Record Office ({{ISBN|9780114402181}})&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1728 as many as 45 Moriscos were recorded burned for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Matar'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2QRd_rbWu8C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 1691 "bonfire of the Jews", Rafael Valls, Rafael Benito Terongi and [[Caterina Tarongí|Catalina Terongi]] were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/europe/07iht-spain07.html|title=In Majorca, Atoning for the Sins of 1691|first=Doreen|last=Carvajal|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nachman Seltzer,''Incredible'', Shaar Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portuguese Inquisition at Goa====
In 1560, the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] opened offices in the Indian colony [[Goa]], known as [[Goa Inquisition]]. Its aim was to protect Catholic orthodoxy among new converts to Christianity, and retain hold on the old, particularly against "Judaizing" deviancy. From the 17th century, Europeans were shocked at the tales of how brutal and extensive the activities of the Inquisition were.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} What modern scholars have established, is that some 4046 individuals in the time 1560–1773 received some sort of punishment from the Portuguese Inquisition, whereof 121 persons were condemned to be burned alive, of those 57 who actually suffered that fate, while the rest escaped it, and were burnt in effigy, instead.&lt;ref&gt;Already noted originally by ''Hunter'' (1886), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vdv7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253–254], see also ''Salomon, Sassoon, Saraiva'' (2001), pp. 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; For the Portuguese Inquisition in total, not just at Goa, modern estimates of persons actually executed on its behest is about 1200, whether burnt alive or not.&lt;ref&gt;See extensive table at [[Portuguese Inquisition]], ''de Almeida'' (1923), in particular p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation concerning "crimes against nature"====
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of two [[homosexuals]] at the stake outside [[Zürich]], 1482 ([[Spiezer Schilling]])]]

From the 12th to the 18th centuries, various European authorities legislated (and held judicial proceedings) against sexual crimes such as [[sodomy]] or [[bestiality]]; often, the prescribed punishment was that of death by burning. Many scholars think that the first time death by burning appeared within explicit codes of law for the crime of sodomy was at the ecclesiastical 1120 [[Council of Nablus]] in the [[Crusaders|crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Here, if public repentance were done, the death penalty might be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;See for '''first time''' ''Heng'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pRXvHbNLPQ0C&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] on '''option of public repentance''' ''Puff, Bennett, Karras'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QThLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387 p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the earliest records for executions for the crime of sodomy are from the 13th–14th centuries, and it is noted there that the preferred mode of execution was death by burning. The Partidas of King Alfonso "El Sabio" condemned sodomites to be castrated and hung upside down to die from the bleeding, following the old testament phrase "their blood shall be upon them".&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Geneva]], the first recorded burning of sodomites occurred in 1555, and up to 1678, some two dozen met the same fate. In [[Venice]], the first burning took place in 1492, and a monk was burnt as late as 1771.&lt;ref&gt;'''On Geneva and Venice''', see ''Coward, Dynes, Donaldson'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=y8_Ya2s3zN8C&amp;pg=PA36 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; The last case in France where two men were condemned by court to be burned alive for engaging in consensual homosexual sex was in 1750 (although, it seems, they were actually strangled prior to being burned). The last case in France where a man was condemned to be burned for a murderous rape of a boy occurred in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;''Crompton'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA450 p. 450]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crackdowns and the public burning of a couple of homosexuals might lead to local panic, and persons thus inclined fleeing from the place. The traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] witnessed such a dynamic when he visited [[Malta]] in 1616 :{{quote|''The fifth day of my staying here, I saw a Spanish soldier and a Maltezen boy burnt in ashes, for the public profession of sodomy; and long before night, there were above an hundred bardassoes, whorish boys, that fled away to Sicily in a galliot, for fear of fire; but never one bugeron stirred, being few or none there free of it.''&lt;ref&gt;''Lithgow'' (1814), [https://books.google.com/books?id=whMwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|Perlachturm with [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter by Perlach]]]]
The actual punishment meted out to, for example, [[pederasts]] could differ according to status. While both in 1532 and 1409 [[Augsburg]] two men were burned alive for their offenses, a rather different procedure was meted out to four ''clerics'' in the 1409 case guilty of the same offence: Instead of being burnt alive, they were locked into a wooden casket that was hung up in the [[Perlachturm]] and they starved to death in that manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1860), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9NCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1532 penal code of Charles V====
In 1532, Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] promulgated his penal code [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]]. A number of crimes were punishable with death by burning, such as coin forgery, arson, and sexual acts "contrary to nature".&lt;ref&gt;specified as men or women found guilty of same-sex sexual behaviour or guilty of having had sex with animals.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those guilty of aggravated theft of sacred objects from a church could be condemned to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;As late as in 1730 [[Poznań|Posen]], a church robber had his right hand cut off, and the stump covered in pitch. Then, the pitch was ignited, and the person was burnt alive on a pyre as well. ''Oehlschlaeger'' (1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F41aAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; Only those found guilty of ''malevolent'' witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;No fixed penalty was placed on performing acts of witchcraft that had caused no harm&lt;/ref&gt; could be punished by death by fire.&lt;ref&gt;All in ''Koch'' (1824) '''Coin forgers''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Article 111, p. 52], '''Malevolent witchcraft''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 Article 109, p. 55] '''Sexual acts contrary to nature''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 Article 116, p. 58], '''Arson''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Article 125, p. 61], '''Theft of sacred objects''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Article 172, p. 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The last burnings from 1804 and 1813=====
According to the jurist {{Interlanguage link multi|Eduard Osenbrüggen|de}}, the last case he knew of where a person had been judicially burned alive on account of arson in Germany happened in 1804, in [[:de:Hötzelsroda|Hötzelsroda]], close by [[Eisenach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]  For a similar, more modern assessment, as well as locating the incident to Hötzelsroda, see Dietze (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which Johannes Thomas&lt;ref&gt;Last name "Mothas" used in extended account in ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), real name "Thomas" given in ''Herden'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wVNuf9VEhGkC&amp;pg=PA89 p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt; was executed on 13 July that year is described as follows: Some feet above the actual pyre, attached to a stake, a wooden chamber had been constructed, into which the delinquent was placed. Pipes or chimneys, filled with sulphuric material led up to the chamber, and that was first lit, so that Thomas died from inhaling the sulphuric smoke, rather than being strictly burnt alive, before his body was consumed by the general fire. Some 20,000 people had gathered to watch Thomas' execution.&lt;ref&gt;On the manner of execution according to the original account, see ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=88dCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178] Contemporary newspaper notice, ''Hübner'' (1804), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyVEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT964 p. 760, column 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thomas is regarded as the last to have been actually executed by means of fire (in this case, through suffocation), the couple Johann Christoph Peter Horst and his lover [[Friederike Luise Delitz|Friederike Louise Christiane Delitz]], who had made a career of robberies in the confusion made by their acts of arson, were condemned to be burnt alive in Berlin 28 May 1813. They were, however, according to [[Gustav Radbruch]], secretly strangled just prior to being burnt, namely when their arms and legs were tied fast to the stake.&lt;ref&gt;'''Original account''' by investigating police officer Heinrich L. Hermann, ''Hermann'' (1818) '''Gustav Rudbrach's mention''' ''Rudbrach'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3JOVbGPdrjYC&amp;pg=PA247 p. 247] '''Precise moment of strangulation''' ''Gräff'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8ZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] '''Modern newspaper article''' ''Springer'' (2008), [http://www.yasni.de/ext.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fregionales%2Fberlin%2Farticle2489746%2FDas-letzte-Feuer.html&amp;name=Christiane+Delitz&amp;cat=news&amp;showads=1 Das Letzte Feuer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two cases are the last where execution by burning might be said to have been ''carried out'' in some degree, Eduard Osenbrüggen mentions that ''verdicts'' to be burned alive were given in several cases in different German states afterwards, such as in cases from 1814, 1821, 1823, 1829 and finally in a case from 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 pp. 21–22, footnote 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Witch-hunts====
[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] (1585), painted by [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]

Burning was used by Christians during the [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch-hunts of Europe]]. The penal code known as the [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] (1532) decreed that sorcery throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] should be treated as a criminal offence, and if it purported to inflict injury upon any person the witch was to be burnt at the stake. In 1572, [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]] imposed the penalty of burning for witchcraft of every kind, including simple fortunetelling.&lt;ref&gt;''Thurston'' (1912) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm%20New%20Advent Witchcraft], 2010 web resource. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the latter half of the 18th century, the number of "[[Nine million victims|nine million witches]] burned in Europe" has been bandied about in popular accounts and media, but has never had a following among specialist researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Professional researchers in the 19th, and early 20th century tended to ''refuse'' giving any quantification at all but, when pushed, typically landed on about 100,000 to 1 million victims&lt;/ref&gt; Today, based on meticulous study of trial records, ecclesiastical and inquisitorial registers and so on, as well as on the utilization of modern statistical methods, the specialist research community on witchcraft has reached an agreement for roughly 40,000–50,000 people executed for witchcraft in Europe in total,&lt;ref&gt;A lowest bound of 30,000 and a highest upper bound of 100,000 still within acceptability, but with a minority of professional researchers supporting either of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and by no means all of them executed by being burned alive. Furthermore, it is solidly established that the peak period of witch-hunts was the century 1550–1650, with a slow increase preceding it, from the 15th century onward, as well as a sharp drop following it, with "witch-hunts" having basically fizzled out by the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wolfgang Behringer]] (1998) on the history of witch-counting, and on specialist academic consensus, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Neun_Millionen/html/ca/0e43e9dea3a4144c50997da6aa74bd34/ Neun Millionen Hexen] Originally published in GWU 49 (1998) pp. 664–685, web publication 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In Denmark, after the [[Protestant Reformation|1536 reformation]], [[Christian IV of Denmark]] (r. 1588–1648) encouraged the practice of burning witches, in particular by the law against witchcraft in 1617. In [[Jutland]], the mainland part of Denmark,  more than half the recorded cases of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries occurred after 1617.  Rough estimates says about a thousand persons were executed due to convictions for [[witchcraft]] in the 1500–1600s, but it is not wholly clear if all of the transgressors were burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;For Denmark, see for example, ''Burns'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&amp;pg=PA64 pp. 64–65]&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
[[Mary I of England|Mary I]] ordered hundreds of [[Protestants]] burnt at the stake during her reign (1553–58) in what would be known as the "[[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation#List of Marian Martyrs|Marian Persecutions]]" earning her the epithet of 'Bloody' Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Foxe]] is particularly mentioned in being assiduous at documenting such cases of persecutions. See, ''Miller'' (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3S89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those martyred by Mary and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are listed in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'', written by Foxe in 1563 and 1570.
[[Edward Wightman]], a Baptist from [[Burton on Trent]], was the last person burned at the stake for [[heresy]] in England in [[Lichfield|Lichfield, Staffordshire]] on 11 April 1612.&lt;ref&gt;For claim of being last heretic burned at the stake, see for example, ''Durso'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=68jfRYQo3zsC&amp;pg=PA29 p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; Although cases can be found of burning heretics in the 16th and 17th centuries England, that penalty for heretics was historically relatively new. For example, it did not exist in 14th century England, and when the bishops in England petitioned King [[Richard II]] to institute death by burning for heretics in 1397, he flatly refused, and no one was burnt for heresy during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;''Sayles'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HVQLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt; Just one year after his death, however, in 1401, [[William Sawtrey]] was burnt alive for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JRkwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1190 p. 1190]&lt;/ref&gt; Death by burning for heresy was formally abolished by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;''Willis-Bund'' (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional punishment for women found guilty of treason was to be [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]], where they did not need to be publicly displayed naked, whereas men were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. The jurist [[William Blackstone]] argued as follows for the differential punishment of females vs. males:
{{quote|For as the decency due to sex forbids the exposing and public mangling of their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows and there be burned alive&lt;ref&gt;Direct citation in ''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, as described in Camille Naish's "Death Comes to the Maiden", in practice, the woman's shift would burn away at the beginning, and she would be left naked anyway.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} There were two types of treason, [[high treason]] for crimes against the sovereign, and [[petty treason]] for the murder of one's lawful superior, including that of a husband by his wife. Commenting on the 18th century execution practice, Frank McLynn says that most convicts condemned to burning were not burnt alive, and that the executioners made sure the women were dead before consigning them to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to have been condemned to death for "petty treason" was Mary Bailey, whose body was burned in 1784. The last woman to be convicted for "high treason", and have her body burnt, in this case for the crime of coin forgery, was [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive list at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/burning.html Burning at the stake].&lt;/ref&gt; The last case where a woman was actually burnt alive in England is that of [[Catherine Hayes (murderer)|Catherine Hayes]] in 1726, for the murder of her husband. In this case, one account says this happened because the executioner accidentally set fire to the pyre before he had hanged Hayes properly.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Shea'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvdKyEJo0osC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Rictor Norton]] has assembled a number of contemporary newspaper reports on the actual death of Mrs. Hayes, internally somewhat divergent. The following excerpt is one example: {{quote|The fuel being placed round her, and lighted with a torch, she begg’d for the sake of Jesus, to be strangled first: whereupon the Executioner drew tight the halter, but the flame coming to his hand in the space of a second, he let it go, when she gave three dreadful shrieks; but the flames taking her on all sides, she was heard no more; and the Executioner throwing a piece of timber into the Fire, it broke her skull, when her brains came plentifully out; and in about an hour more she was entirely reduced to ashes.&lt;ref&gt;See website article, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/grubstreet/hayes.htm The Case of Catherine Hayes] at [http://rictornorton.co.uk/ rictornorton.co.uk] See also the detailed synthesis at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hayes.html Catherine Hayes burnt for Petty Treason]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Scotland====
[[James VI of Scotland]] (later [[James I of England]]) shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials. This special interest of the king resulted in the [[North Berwick witch trials]], which led more than seventy people to be accused of witchcraft in [[Scotland]] due to inclement weather. James sailed in 1590 to Denmark to meet his betrothed, [[Anne of Denmark]], who, ironically, is believed by some to have secretly converted to Roman Catholicism herself from Lutheranism around 1598, although historians are divided on whether she ever was received into the Roman Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic." ''Wilson'' (1963), p. 95 "Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace" ''Fraser'' (1997), p. 15  "The Queen ... [converted] from her native Lutheranism to a discreet, but still politically embarrassing Catholicism which alienated many ministers of the Kirk" ''Croft'' (2003), pp. 24–25 "Catholic foreign ambassadors—who would surely have welcomed such a situation—were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606." ''Stewart'' (2003), p. 182 "In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne ... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author of this report, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible.' Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life—even after her death—they remained obfuscated." ''Hogge'' (2005), pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to be executed as a witch in Scotland was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727, condemned to death for using her own daughter as a flying horse in order to travel. Janet Horne was burnt alive in a tar barrel.&lt;ref&gt;''Pavlac'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KCjlptFEMZsC&amp;pg=PA145 p. 145]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
[[Petronilla de Meath]] (c. 1300–1324) was the maidservant of Dame [[Alice Kyteler]], a 14th-century [[Hiberno-Norman]] noblewoman. After the death of Kyteler's fourth husband, the widow was accused of practicing [[witchcraft]] and Petronilla of being her accomplice. Petronilla was tortured and forced to proclaim that she and Kyteler were guilty of witchcraft. Petronilla was then flogged and eventually burnt at the stake on 3 November 1324, in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''de Ledrede, Wright'' (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de ''Ledrede, Davidson, Ward'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Hers was the first known case in the history of the [[British Isles]] of death by fire for the crime of [[heresy]]. Kyteler was charged by the [[Bishop of Ossory]], Richard de Ledrede, with a wide slate of crimes, from [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and [[demonism]] to the murders of several husbands. She was accused of having illegally acquired her wealth through [[witchcraft]], which accusations came principally from her stepchildren, the children of her late husbands by their previous marriages. The trial predated any formal witchcraft statute in Ireland, thus relying on [[canon law|ecclesiastical law]] (which treated witchcraft as [[heresy]]) rather than [[English common law]] (which treated it as a [[felony]]). Under torture, Petronilla claimed she and her mistress applied a magical ointment to a wooden beam, which enabled both women to fly. She was then forced to proclaim publicly that Lady Alice and her followers were guilty of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Some were convicted and whipped, but others, Petronilla included, were [[Burning at the stake|burnt at the stake]]. With the help of relatives, Alice Kyteler fled, taking with her Petronilla's daughter, Basilia.&lt;ref&gt;Story of flight in contemporary chronicle ''Gilbert'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=R_w-CZ0eXnYC&amp;pg=PR134 p. cxxxiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, [[Bridget Cleary]] (née Boland), a [[County Tipperary]] woman, was burnt by her husband and others, the stated motive for the crime being the belief that the real Bridget had been abducted by [[fairy|fairies]] with a [[changeling]] left in her place. Her husband claimed to have slain only the changeling. The gruesome nature of the case prompted extensive press coverage. The trial was closely followed by newspapers in both Ireland and Britain.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"&gt;''McCullough'' (2000), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D91E3AF93BA35753C1A9669C8B63 The Fairy Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; As one reviewer commented, nobody, with the possible exception of the presiding judge, thought it was an ordinary murder case.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"/&gt;

===Slavery and colonialism in the Americas===

====North America====
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|Native Americans scalping and roasting their prisoners, published in 1873]]
Indigenous North Americans often used burning as a form of execution, against members of other tribes or white settlers during the 18th and 19th centuries. Roasting over a slow fire was a customary method.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott'' (1940) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; {See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]}

In [[Massachusetts]], there are two known cases of burning at the stake. First, in 1681, a slave named Maria tried to kill her owner by setting his house on fire. She was convicted of arson and burned at the stake in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]].&lt;ref name="Maria, Burned at the Stake"&gt;CelebrateBoston.com (2014), [http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-burned-at-stake-maria.htm "Maria, Burned at the Stake"]&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, a slave named Jack, convicted in a separate arson case, was hanged at a nearby gallows, and after death his body was thrown into the fire with that of Maria. Second, in 1755, a group of slaves had conspired and killed their owner, with servants Mark and Phillis executed for his murder. Mark was hanged and his body [[gibbet]]ed, and Phillis burned at the stake, at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Mark and Phillis Executions"&gt;[http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-mark-and-phillis-executions.htm Mark and Phillis Executions] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], then part of [[New France]], [[Marie-Joseph Angélique]], a black slave, was sentenced to being burned alive for an arson which destroyed 45 homes and a hospital in 1734. The sentence was commuted on appeal to burning after death by stangulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Joseph Angélique]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}

In New York, several burnings at the stake are recorded, particularly following suspected slave revolt plots. In 1708, one woman was burnt and one man hanged. In the aftermath of the [[New York Slave Revolt of 1712]], 20 people were burnt (one of the leaders slowly roasted, before he died after 10 hours of torture&lt;ref&gt;''McManus'' (1973), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2H3S1OLtmagC&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;) and during the alleged [[New York Conspiracy of 1741|slave conspiracy of 1741]], at least 13 slaves were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoey'' (1974),[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/terror-new-york--1741 Terror in New York–1741]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bartolomé de las Casas]], a 16th-century eyewitness to the brutal subjugation of the Native Americans by the Spanish conquistadores, has left a particularly harrowing description of how roasting alive was a favoured technique of repression:&lt;ref&gt;''De las Casas'' (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=krP0qAvXK4QC&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34–35]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They usually dealt with the chieftains and nobles in the following way: they made a grid of rods which they placed on forked sticks, then lashed the victims to the grid and lighted a smoldering fire underneath, so that little by little, as those captives screamed in despair and torment, their souls would leave them. I once saw this, when there were four or five nobles lashed on grids and burning; I seem even to recall that there were two or three pairs where others were burning, and because they uttered such loud screams that they disturbed the captain's sleep, he ordered them to be strangled. And the constable, who was worse than an executioner, did not want to obey that order (and I know the name of that constable and know his relatives in Seville), but instead put a stick over the victims' tongues, so they could not make a sound, and he stirred up the fire, but not too much, so that they roasted slowly, as he liked.}}

The last known burning by the Spanish Colonial government in Latin America was of Mariana de Castro, in [[Lima, Peru]] {{Why?|date=November 2013}} in February 1732.&lt;ref&gt;''Carvacho'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=P30WGMWwsqMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62] "y que habiendo llegado el caso de practicar lo determinado por el Consejo en auto de 4 de febrero de 1732, ... acordaron, después de revisar la causa de Mariana de Castro y lo determinado por la Suprema el 4 de febrero de 1732"&lt;/ref&gt;

====British West Indies====
In 1760, the slave rebellion known as [[Tacky's War]] broke out in [[Jamaica]]. Apparently, some of the defeated rebels were burned alive, while others were gibbeted alive, left to die of thirst and starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Waddell'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bt71nHmVezMC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, nine African slaves at [[Tobago]] were found complicit of murdering a white man. Eight of them had first their right arms chopped off, and were then burned alive bound to stakes, according to the report of an eyewitness.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake'' (1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6lDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 pp. 154–155]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch Suriname====
In 1855 the Dutch abolitionist and historian [[:nl:Julien Wolbers|Julien Wolbers]] spoke to the Anti Slavery Society in Amsterdam. Painting a dark picture of the condition of slaves in Suriname, he mentions in particular that as late as in 1853, just two years previously, "three Negroes were burnt alive".&lt;ref&gt;''Woblers'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=WqcNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
The [[Greek War of Independence]] in the 1820s contained several instances of death by burning. When the Greeks in April 1821 captured a corvette near Hydra, the Greeks chose to roast to death the 57 Ottoman crew members. After the fall of [[Tripolitsa Massacre|Tripolitsa]] in September 1821, European officers were horrified to note that not only were Muslims suspected of hiding money being slowly roasted after having had their arms and legs cut off but, in one instance, three Muslim children were roasted over a fire while their parents were forced to watch. On their part, the Ottomans committed many similar acts; for example, in retaliation they gathered up Greeks in Constantinople, throwing several of them into huge ovens, baking them to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[William St Clair]], ''That Greece Might Still Be Free'' (2008) ''Hydra incident'', p. xxiv, ''those suspected of hiding money'', p. 45, ''the three Turkish children'', p. 77, ''baked in ovens'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic countries===

====Followers of a false claimant of prophethood====
The Arab chieftain [[Tulayha|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asad]] set himself up as a prophet in AD 630. Tulayha had a strong following which was, however, soon quashed in the so-called [[Ridda Wars]]. He himself escaped, though, and later was reconverted to Islam, but many of his rebel followers were burnt to death; his mother chose to embrace the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Zurkhana, Houtsma'' (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wpM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA830 p. 830]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Please refer to a trustworthy sources, such as Muslims' classical books|date=December 2016}}

====Catholic monks in 13th-century Tunis and Morocco====
A number of monks are said to have been burnt alive in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]] in the 13th century. In 1243, two English monks, Brothers Rodulph and Berengarius, after having secured the release of some 60 captives, were charged with being English spies, and were burnt alive on 9 September. In 1262, Brothers Patrick and William, again having freed captives, but also sought to proselytize among Muslims, were burnt alive in Morocco. In 1271, 11 Catholic monks were burnt alive in Tunis. Several other cases are reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Digby'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA342 pp. 342–345]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Converts to Christianity====

[[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], i.e. the act of converting to another religion, was (and remains so in a few countries) punishable with death.
 
The French traveller [[Jean de Thevenot]], traveling the East in the 1650s, says: ''"Those that turn Christians, they burn alive, hanging a bag of Powder about their neck, and putting a [[Pitch (resin)|pitched]] Cap upon their Head."''&lt;ref&gt;''De Thevenot, Lovell'' (1687), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=69&amp;id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling the same regions some 60 years earlier, [[Fynes Moryson]] writes:
{{quote|''A Turke forsaking his Fayth and a Christian speaking or doing anything against the law of [[Muhammad|Mahomett]] are burnt with fyer.''&lt;ref&gt;''Moryson, Hadfield'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fl6gkL5h6A0C&amp;pg=PA171 p. 171]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(''NOTE:'' De Thevenot says Christians committing blasphemy against Islam were impaled, rather than burnt, if they do not convert to Islam.)

====Muslim heretics====

''[[Certain accursed ones of no significance]]'' is the term used by [[Taş Köprü Zade]] in the ''Şakaiki Numaniye'' to describe some members of the [[Hurufiyya]] who became intimate with the Sultan [[Mehmed II]] to the extent of initiating him as a follower. This alarmed members of the [[Ulema]], particularly Mahmut Paşa, who then consulted Mevlana Fahreddin. Fahreddin hid in the Sultan's palace and heard the [[Hurufi]]s propound their doctrines. Considering these heretical, he reviled them with curses. The [[Hurufi]]s fled to the Sultan, but Fahreddin's denunciation of them was so virulent that [[Mehmed II]] was unable to defend them. Farhreddin then took them in front of the [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]], [[Edirne]], where he publicly condemned them to death. While preparing the fire for their execution, Fahreddin accidentally set fire to his beard. However the [[Hurufi]]s were burnt to death.

====Barbary States, 18th century====
[[John Braithwaite (author)|John Braithwaite]], staying in [[Morocco]] in the late 1720s, says that apostates from Islam would be burnt alive:
{{quote|''THOSE that can be proved after Circumcision to have revolted, are stripped quite naked, then anointed with Tallow, and with a Chain about the Body, brought to the Place of Execution, where they are burnt.''}}

Similarly, he notes that non-Muslims entering mosques or being blasphemous against Islam will be burnt, unless they convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Braithwaite''(1729)On apostates citation, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=366&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 366], on the conditional fate of non-Muslims, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=355&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 355]&lt;/ref&gt; The chaplain for the English in [[Algiers]] at the same time, [[Thomas Shaw (divine and traveller)|Thomas Shaw]], wrote that whenever capital crimes were committed either by Christian slaves or Jews, the Christian or Jew was to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaw'' (1757), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253]&lt;/ref&gt; Several generations later, in Morocco in 1772, a Jewish interpreter to the British, and a merchant in his own right, sought from the [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Emperor of Morocco]] restitution for some goods confiscated, and was burnt alive for his impertinence. His widow made her woes clear in a letter to the British.&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman'' (1979), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA310 pp. 310–311]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 in [[Ifrane]], Morocco, 50 Jews preferred to be burned alive, rather than convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SD_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230 p. 230]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 in Algiers, the Jewish Rabbi Mordecai Narboni was accused of having maligned Islam in a quarrel with his neighbour. He was ordered to be burnt alive unless he converted to Islam, but he refused and was therefore executed on 14 July 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.dll?jg~jgsys~josdates JOS Calendar Conversion Results], ''Hirschberg'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_mh5fuel0QC&amp;pg=PA20 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, Ali Benghul made a short-lived ''coup d'état'' in [[Tripoli]], deposing the ruling [[Karamanli dynasty]]. During his short, violent reign he seized for example, the two interpreters for the Dutch and English consuls, both of them Jews, and roasted them over a slow fire, on charges of conspiracy and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;''Tully'' (1817), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBkQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 p. 365]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persia====
During a famine in Persia in 1668, the government took severe measures against those trying to profiteer from the misfortune of the populace. Restaurant owners found guilty of profiteering were slowly roasted on spits, and greedy bakers were baked in their own ovens.&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrier'' (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5CLkDgmVs1QC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician, Dr C.J. Wills, traveling through [[Persia]] in 1866–81 noted that shortly before his (Wills') arrival, a "priest" had been burned alive. Wills wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Wills'' (1891), [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7180554M/In_the_land_of_the_lion_and_sun p. 204]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Just prior to my first arrival in Persia, the "Hissam-u-Sultaneh", another uncle of the king, had burned a priest to death for a horrible crime and murder; the priest was chained to a stake, and the matting from the mosques piled on him to a great height, the pile of mats was lighted and burnt freely, but when the mats were consumed the priest was found groaning, but still alive. The executioner went to Hissam-u-Sultaneh who ordered him to obtain more mats, pour naphtha on them, and apply a light, which 'after some hours' he did.''}}

===Roasting by means of heated metal===
The previous cases concern primarily death by burning through contact with open fire or burning material; a slightly different principle is to enclose an individual within, or attach him to, a metal contraption which is subsequently heated. In the following, some reports of such incidents, or anecdotes about such are included.

====The brazen bull====
[[File:Pierre Woeiriot Phalaris.jpg|thumb|Perillos being forced into the brazen bull that he built for Phalaris]]

Perhaps the most infamous example of a [[brazen bull]], which is a hollow metal structure shaped like a bull within which the condemned is put, and then roasted alive as the metal bull is gradually heated up, is the one allegedly constructed by Perillos of [[Athens]] for the 6th-century BC tyrant [[Phalaris]] at [[Agrigentum]], [[Sicily]]. As the story goes, the first victim of the bull was its constructor Perillos himself. The historian George Grote was among those regarding this story as having sufficient evidence behind it to be true, and points particularly to that the Greek poet [[Pindar]], working just one or two generations after the times of Phalaris refers to the brazen bull. A bronze bull was, in fact, one of the spoils of victory when the [[Carthaginians]] conquered Agrigentum.&lt;ref&gt;''Grote'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=62HlSNN2lqQC&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305, footnote 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a brazen bull as an execution device is not wholly unique. About 1000 years later, for example, in AD 497, it can be read in an old chronicle about the [[Visigoths]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the south of France:
{{quote|[[Burdunellus]] became a tyrant in Spain and a year later was ... handed over by his own men and having been sent to [[Toulouse]], he was placed inside a bronze bull and burnt to death.&lt;ref&gt;Quote and extrapolation to be found in ''Collins'' (2004), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Fate of a Scottish regicide====
[[Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl]] was a Scottish nobleman complicit in the murder of King [[James I of Scotland]]. On 26 March 1437 Stewart had a red hot iron crown placed upon his head, was cut in pieces alive, his heart was taken out, and then thrown in a fire. A papal [[nuncio]], the later Pope [[Pius II]] witnessed the execution of Stewart and his associate [[Sir Robert Graham]], and, reportedly, said he was at a loss to determine whether the ''crime'' committed by the regicides, or the ''punishment'' of them was the greater.&lt;ref&gt;''Encycl. Perth.'' (1816), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoJnKgmUH54C&amp;pg=PA131 p. 131, column 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====György Dózsa on the iron throne====
[[File:GeorgheDoja.jpg|thumb|right|Dózsa's execution (contemporary woodcut)]]
[[György Dózsa]] led a peasants' revolt in Hungary, and was captured in 1514. He was bound to a glowing iron throne and a likewise hot iron crown was placed on his head, and he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Klein'' (1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ppwAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tale of the murderous midwife====
In a few English 18th- and 19th-century newspapers and magazines, a tale was circulated about the particularly brutal manner in which a French midwife was put to death on 28 May 1673 in Paris. No fewer than 62 infant skeletons were found buried on her premises, and she was condemned on multiple accounts of abortion/infanticide. One detailed account of her supposed execution runs as follows:
{{quote|A gibbet was erected, under which a fire was made, and the prisoner being brought to the place of execution, was hung up in a large iron cage, in which were also placed sixteen wild cats, which had been catched in the woods for the purpose.—When the heat of the fire became too great to be endured with patience, the cats flew upon the woman, as the cause of the intense pain they felt.—In about fifteen minutes they had pulled out her intrails, though she continued yet alive, and sensible, imploring, as the greatest favour, an immediate death from the hands of some charitable spectator. No one however dared to afford her the least assistance; and she continued in this wretched situation for the space of thirty-five minutes, and then expired in unspeakable torture. At the time of her death, twelve of the cats were expired, and the other four were all dead in less than two minutes afterwards.}}

The English commentator adds his own view on the matter:{{quote|However cruel this execution may appear with regard to the poor animals, it certainly cannot be thought too severe a punishment for such a monster of iniquity, as could calmly proceed in acquiring a fortune by the deliberate murder of such numbers of unoffending, harmless innocents. And if a method of executing murderers, in a manner somewhat similar to this was adapted in England, perhaps the horrid crime of murder might not so frequently disgrace the annals of the present times.&lt;ref&gt;''Stevens'' (1764), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DIsfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA522 pp. 522–523]&lt;/ref&gt; }}
The English story is derived from a pamphlet published in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;For full title and provenance, see item 357 in ''Nassau'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MDlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA17 p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pouring molten metal down the throat or ears===

====Molten gold poured down the throat====
A number of stories concern individuals who are said to have been executed by having molten gold (melting point 1064&amp;nbsp;°C/1947&amp;nbsp;°F) poured down their throats. For example, in 88 BC, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] captured the Roman general [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Manius Aquillius]], and executed him by pouring molten gold down his throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Steel'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae63Gjp21SgC&amp;pg=PA98 p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; A popular but unsubstantiated rumor also had the Parthians executing the famously greedy Roman general [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in this manner in 53 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:HulaguInBagdad.JPG|thumb|[[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] (left) imprisons Caliph Al-Musta'sim among his treasures to starve him to death. Medieval depiction from "Le livre des merveilles", 15th century.]]

[[Genghis Khan]] is said to have poured molten gold down the throat of a perfidious governor in 1220,&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57] According to the 13th-century historian [[Shihab al-Din Muhammad al-Nasawi|al-Nasawi]], the governor Inal Khan (who had assassinated the Mongol ambassadors and thus given Genghis Khan cause to invade), had the molten gold poured into his eyes and ears, rather than down his throat. ''Cameron, Sela'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt; and an early 14th-century chronicle mentions that his grandson [[Hulagu Khan]] did likewise to the sultan [[Al-Musta'sim]] after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad in 1258]] to the Mongol army.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford regards the Hulagu story as a legend ''Crawford'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BfNqgYlo9fMC&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt; (Marco Polo's version is that [[Al-Musta'sim]] was locked without food or water to starve in his treasure room)
[[File:Theodor de Bry 78.jpeg|thumb|[[Theodor de Bry]] engraving of a Conquistador being executed by gold]]
The Spanish in 16th-century Americas gave horrified reports that the Spanish who had been captured by the natives (who had learnt of the Spanish thirst for gold) had their feet and hands bound, and then molten gold poured down their throats as the victims were mocked: "Eat, eat gold, Christians".&lt;ref&gt;''Cummins, Cole, Zorach'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUKBQfzKlIYC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century reports from the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (present day [[Thailand]]) stated that those who have defrauded the public treasury could have either molten gold or silver poured down their throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Begbie'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0MwNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA447 p. 447]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A punishment for inebriation and tobacco smoking====
The 16th-/early 17th-century prime minister [[Malik Ambar]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]] would not tolerate inebriation among his subjects, and would pour molten lead (melting point 327&amp;nbsp;°C/621.43&amp;nbsp;°F) down the mouths of those caught in that condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Eaton'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNNgdBWoYKoC&amp;pg=PA121 p. 121]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 17th century [[Sultanate of Aceh]] Sultan [[Iskandar Muda]] (r. 1607–36) is said to have poured molten lead into the mouths of at least two drunken subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Peletz'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4TA4hjqjJ0C&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Military discipline in 19th-century [[Burma]] was reportedly harsh, with strict prohibition of smoking [[opium]] or drinking [[arrack]]. Some monarchs, it appears, had ordained pouring molten lead down the throats of those who drank anyway, "but it has been found necessary to relax this severity, in order to conciliate the army"&lt;ref&gt;''Buckingham'' (1835), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qrhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah [[Safi of Persia|Safi I]] of Persia is said to have abhorred tobacco, and apparently in 1634, he prescribed the punishment of pouring molten lead into the throats of smokers.&lt;ref&gt;''Berger, Sicker'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jjhnbu8ytEC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A Mongol punishment for horse thieves====
According to historian Pushpa Sharma, stealing a horse was considered the most heinous offence within the Mongol army, and the culprit would either have molten lead poured into his ears, or alternatively, his punishment would be the breaking of the spinal cord or beheading.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharma, Srivastava'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKJiBUFrmfoC&amp;pg=PA361 p. 361]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese tradition of Buddhist self-immolation===
Apparently, for many centuries, a tradition of devotional [[self-immolation]] existed among [[Buddhist]] monks in China. One monk who immolated himself in AD 527, explained his intent a year before, in the following manner:
{{quote|The body is like a poisonous plant; it would really be right to burn it and extinguish its life. I have been weary of this physical frame for many a long day. I vow to worship the buddhas, just like Xijian.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A severe critic in the 16th century wrote the following comment on this practice:
{{quote|There are demonic people ... who pour on oil, stack up firewood, and burn their bodies while still alive. Those who look on are overawed and consider it the attainment of enlightenment. This is erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA198 pp. 198–199]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japanese persecution of Christians===
{{further|Persecution of Christians in Japan}}
In the first half of the 17th century, Japanese authorities sporadically persecuted Christians, with some executions seeing persons being burnt alive. At [[Nagasaki]] in 1622, for example, some 25 monks were burnt alive,&lt;ref&gt;''Lee'' (2010),[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKj2B9vd7HsC&amp;pg=PA121 pp. 121–122]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Edo]] in 1624, 50 Christians were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Matsumoto'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kF1sTidtP_sC&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stories of cannibalism===

====Americas====
Even fateful encounters with cannibals are recorded: in 1514, in the Americas, Francis of Córdoba and five companions were, reportedly, caught, impaled on spits, roasted and eaten by the natives. In 1543, such was also the end of a previous bishop, [[Vincente de Valverde|Vincent de Valle Viridi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Perckmayr'' (1738), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3lpBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA628 p. 628]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiji====
In 1844, the missionary John Watsford wrote a letter about the internecine wars on [[Fiji]], and how captives could be eaten, after being roasted alive:
{{quote|At Mbau, perhaps, more human beings are eaten than anywhere else. A few weeks ago they ate twenty-eight in one day. They had seized their wretched victims while fishing, and brought them alive to Mbau, and there half-killed them, and then put them into their ovens. Some of them made several vain attempts to escape from the scorching flame.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvert, Rowe'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ov1EAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA258 p. 258]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actual manner of the roasting process was described by the missionary pioneer David Cargill, in 1838:
{{quote|When about to be immolated, he is made to sit on the ground with his feet under his thighs and his hands placed before him. He is then bound so that he cannot move a limb or a joint. In this posture he is placed on stones heated for the occasion (and some of them are red-hot), and then covered with leaves and earth, to be roasted alive. When cooked, he is taken out of the oven and, his face and other parts being painted black, that he may resemble a living man ornamented for a feast or for war, he is carried to the temple of the gods and, being still retained in a sitting posture, is offered as a propitiatory sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hogg'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Immolation of widows===

====Indian subcontinent====
{{main|Sati (practice)|l1=Sati}}
[[File:A Hindoo Widow Burning Herself with the Corpse of her Husband.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s]]
[[File:Burning of a Widow.jpg|thumb|''Ceremony of Burning a Hindu Widow with the Body of her Late Husband'', from ''Pictorial History of China and India'', 1851]]

Sati refers to a [[funeral]] practice among some communities of [[Indian subcontinent]] in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|immolates herself]] on her husband's [[funeral pyre]]. The first reliable evidence for the practice of ''sati'' appears from the time of the [[Gupta Empire]] (AD 400),  when instances of sati began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones.&lt;ref name="Shastri"&gt;Shakuntala Rao Shastri, ''Women in the Sacred Laws''—the later law books (1960), also reproduced online at [http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222221/http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/ |date=8 April 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one model of history thinking, the practice of ''sati'' only became really widespread with the Muslim invasions of India, and the practice of ''sati'' now acquired a new meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain. As S.S.Sashi lays out the argument, "The argument is that the practice came into effect during the Islamic invasion of India, to protect their honor from Muslims who were known to commit mass rape on the women of cities that they could capture successfully."&lt;ref&gt;''Sashi'' (1996), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that according to the memorial stone evidence, the practice was carried out in appreciable numbers in western and southern parts of India, and even in some areas, before pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;For Yang's full discussion back and forth, see ''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the rulers and activist of the time sought actively to suppress the practice of ''sati''.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;S.M. ''Ikram, Embree'' (1964) [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html XVII. "Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals"]  This page maintained by Prof. [[Frances Pritchett]], [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began to compile statistics of the incidences of ''sati'' for all their domains from 1815 and onwards. The official statistics for [[Bengal]] represents that the practice was much more common here than elsewhere, recorded numbers typically in the range 500-600 per year, up to the year 1829, when the British authorities banned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;These statistics are further researched and discussed by other scholars, for their reliability (in particular, ''objections'' to that) and representation, see  '''For detailed official statistical information 1815-1829''',''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA23 pp.23-25] see pages 24 and 25 in particular, history behind them, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Since 19th - 20th Century, the practice remains outlawed in Indian subcontinent.

[[Jauhar]] was a practice among royal Hindu women to prevent capture by Muslim conquerors.

====Bali and Nepal====
The practice of burning widows has not been restricted to the Indian subcontinent; at [[Bali]], the practice was called ''masatia'' and, apparently, restricted to the burning of royal widows. Although the Dutch colonial authorities had banned the practice, one such occasion is attested as late as in 1903, probably for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;For notice of estimate of last time, see ''Schulte Nordholt'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUVlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 pp. 211–212, footnote 56]  For estimate of restriction to royal widows, see ''Wiener'' (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GE1uc1UNXNYC&amp;pg=PA267 p. 267]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the practice was not banned until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;''Mittra, Kumar'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYEQGam5hVgC&amp;pg=PA200 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions in sub-Saharan African cultures===
C.H.L. Hahn&lt;ref&gt;Biographical entry of C.H.L. Hahn at [http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_H.htm BIOGRAPHIES OF NAMIBIAN PERSONALITIES]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that within the O-ndnonga tribe among the [[Ovambo people]] in modern-day [[Namibia]], abortion was not used at all (in contrast to among the other tribes), and that furthermore, if two young unwed individuals had sex resulting in pregnancy, then both the girl and the boy were "taken out to the bush, bound up in bundles of grass and ... burnt alive."&lt;ref&gt;''Hahn'' (1966), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8Z3FQXOiNEC&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation against the practice===
In 1790, Sir Benjamin Hammett introduced a bill into [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to end the practice of judicial burning. He explained that the year before, as [[Sheriff]] of London, he had been responsible for the burning of [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]], found guilty of [[counterfeit]]ing, but that he had allowed her to be hanged first. He pointed out that as the law stood, he himself could have been found guilty of a crime in not carrying out the lawful punishment and, as no woman had been burnt alive in the kingdom for more than half a century, so could all those still alive who had held an official position at all of the previous burnings. The [[Treason Act 1790]] was duly passed by Parliament and given [[royal assent]] by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (30 George III. C. 48).&lt;ref&gt;''Wilson'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JdkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern burnings==
===Retaliation against Nazis===
[[Benjamin B. Ferencz]], one of the prosecutors in the [[Nuremberg trials]] who, in May 1945, investigated occurrences at the [[Ebensee concentration camp]], and narrated them to Tom Hofmann, a family member and biographer. He was completely outraged at what the Nazis had done there. When people discovered an SS guard who attempted to flee, they tied him to one of the metal trays used to transport bodies into the crematorium. They then proceeded to light the oven, and slowly roast the SS guard to death, taking him in and out of the oven several times. Ferencz said to Hofmann that at the time, he was in no position to stop the proceedings of the mob, and frankly admitted that he had not been inclined to try. Hofmann adds, "There seemed to be no limit to human brutality in wartime."&lt;ref&gt;''Hofmann'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXZzAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lynching of Germans in Czechoslovakia===

During the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] after the end of [[World War II]], a number of massacres against the German minority occurred. In one case in Prague in May 1945, a Czech mob hanged several Germans upside down on lampposts, doused them in fuel and set them on fire, burning them alive.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried F. Schoeller: [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/rueckkehr-in-die-verschollene-geschichte.700.de.html?dram:article_id=83403 ''Rückkehr in die verschollene Geschichte''] [[Deutschlandfunk]].de, 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Facius: [https://www.welt.de/debatte/kolumnen/Meine-Woche/article6060701/Kleines-Wunder-an-der-Moldau.html ''Kleines Wunder an der Moldau''] [[Die Welt|Welt.de]], 10 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2018}}

===Necklacing===
[[Necklacing]] is the practice of summary execution and torture carried out by forcing a rubber tire, filled with petrol, around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on fire. The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process. The method was widely used in [[Haiti]] and [[South Africa]].

===Extrajudicial burnings in Latin America===

In [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], [[Necklacing|burning people standing inside a pile of tires]] is a common form of murder used by drug dealers to punish those who have supposedly collaborated with the police. This form of burning is called ''micro-ondas'' (microwave oven).&lt;ref&gt;''Grellet'' (2010) [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/740136-autorizado-a-visitar-familia-condenado-por-morte-de-tim-lopes-foge-da-prisao.shtml Autorizado a visitar família..]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|title=Polícia encontra 4 corpos que seriam de traficantes queimados com pneus|language=Portuguese|publisher=Federação Nacional dos Policiais Federais|date=18 September 2008|author=O Globo|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=[[Rio de Janeiro]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925094951/http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|archive-date=25 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/pten/micro-ondas|title=micro-ondas|publisher=WordReference|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (''Elite Squad'')  and the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' contain scenes depicting this practice.&lt;ref name="A Revista Veja, o PT e as Tendências"&gt;''França'' (2002), [http://veja.abril.com.br/300102/p_094.html Como na Chicago de Capone]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] the Guatemalan Army and security forces carried out an unknown number of extrajudicial killings by burning. In one instance in March 1967, Guatemalan guerrilla and poet [[Otto René Castillo]] was captured by Guatemalan government forces and taken to [[Zacapa]] army barracks alongside one of his comrades, Nora Paíz Cárcamo. The two were interrogated, tortured for four days, and burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Paige'' (1983), pp. 699–737&lt;/ref&gt; Other reported instances of immolation by Guatemalan government forces occurred in the Guatemalan government's rural counterinsurgency operations in the Guatemalan Altiplano in the 1980s. In April 1982, 13 members of a Quanjobal Pentecostal congregation in Xalbal, [[Ixcan]], were burnt alive in their church by the Guatemalan Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Garrard-Burnett'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXWwm7jo-hEC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 1996, a Mexican man, Rodolfo Soler Hernandez, was burned to death in [[Playa Vicente|Playa Vicente, Mexico]], after he was accused of raping and strangling a local woman to death. Local residents tied Hernandez to a tree, doused him in a flammable liquid and then set him ablaze. His death was also filmed by residents of the village. Shots taken before the killing showed that he had been badly beaten. On 5 September 1996, Mexican television stations broadcast footage of the murder.

A young Guatemalan woman, Alejandra María Torres, was attacked by a mob in [[Guatemala City]] on 15 December 2009. The mob alleged that Torres had attempted to rob passengers on a bus.

===Lynchings and mass killings by burning in the US===

During the 1980 [[New Mexico State Penitentiary riot]], a number of inmates were burnt to death by fellow inmates, who used [[blow torch]]es. Modern burnings continued as a method of [[lynching in the United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]]. One of the most notorious extrajudicial burnings in modern history occurred in [[Waco, Texas]] on 15 May 1916. [[Jesse Washington lynching|Jesse Washington]], an African-American [[farmhand]], after having been convicted of the rape and subsequent murder of a white woman, was taken by a mob to a bonfire, castrated, doused in [[coal oil]], and hanged by the neck from a chain over the bonfire, slowly burning to death. A postcard from the event still exists, showing a crowd standing next to Washington's charred corpse with the words on the back "This is the barbecue we had last night. My picture is to the left with a cross over it. Your son, Joe". This attracted international condemnation and is remembered as the "[[Waco Horror]]".&lt;ref&gt;''DuBois'' (1916), [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf pp. 1–8] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6FXqUzw4u?url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade Goodwyn|Goodwyn, Wade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">'''Disciplinary institutions''' ([[French language|French]]: ''institution disciplinaire'') is a [[concept]] proposed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975).  [[School]], [[prison]], [[barracks]], or the [[hospital]] are examples of historical disciplinary [[institution]]s, all created in their modern form in the 19th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Discovery.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A personification of discovery as represented by a [[statue]] in [[The American Adventure]] in the [[World]] Showcase pavilion of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]].]] --&gt;

'''Discovery''' is the act of detecting something new, or something previously unrecognized as meaningful. With reference to [[sciences]] and [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], discovery is the [[observation]] of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.&lt;ref name="bbcHiggs121211" /&gt; A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations, or ideas. Some discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology.

==Description==
New discoveries are acquired through various [[sense]]s and are usually assimilated, merging with pre-existing [[knowledge]] and [[action (philosophy)|action]]s. Questioning is a major form of human thought and interpersonal communication, and plays a key role in discovery. Discoveries are often made due to [[question]]s. Some discoveries lead to the [[invention]] of objects, processes, or techniques. A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations or ideas, and the process of discovery requires at least the awareness that an existing concept or method can be modified or transformed. However, some discoveries also represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge.

===Within science===
Within scientific disciplines, discovery is the observation of new [[phenomenon|phenomena]], actions, or events which helps explain knowledge gathered through previously acquired [[scientific evidence]]. In science, exploration is one of three purposes of research, the other two being description and explanation. Discovery is made by providing observational evidence and attempts to develop an initial, rough understanding of some phenomenon.

Discovery within the field of [[particle physics]] has an accepted definition for what constitutes a discovery:  a [[standard deviation#Table|five-sigma]] level of certainty.&lt;ref name="bbcHiggs121211"/&gt; Such a level defines [[statistic]]ally how unlikely it is that an [[experiment]]al result is due to [[Randomness|chance]]. The combination of a five-sigma level of certainty, and independent confirmation by other experiments, turns findings into accepted discoveries.&lt;ref name="bbcHiggs121211"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16116230 | title= Higgs boson: Excitement builds over 'glimpses' at LHC | date= 12 December 2011| work= [[BBC News]] | first= Paul |last= Rincon | accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Within education ===
Within the field of education, discovery occurs through observations. These observations are common and come in various forms. Observations can occur as observations of students done by the teacher or observations of teachers done by other professionals. Student observations help teachers to identify where the students are developmentally and cognitively in the realm of their studies. Teacher observations are used by administrators to hold teachers accountable as they stay on target with their learning goals and treat the students with respect. From these different types of observations we discover the best possible education practices.

==== Observations of students completed by teachers ====
Teachers observe students throughout the day in the classroom. These observations can be informal or formal. Teachers often use checklist, anecdotal notes, videos, interviews, written work or assessment, etc. In completing these observations, teachers can determine at which level the student is understanding the lessons. Using the information from observations, then allows teachers to make the necessary adaptations for the students in the classroom. These observations can also provide the foundation for strong relationships between teachers and students. When students have these relationships they feel safer and more comfortable in the classroom and are more willing and eager to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablon|first=Judy|date=2009|title=Taking it all in: Observation in the classroom|url=https://www.isbe.net/Documents_KIDSWebsiteResources/Taking%20it%20all%20in.pdf|journal=Teaching Young Children|volume=4|pages=24–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through observations teachers discover the most developmentally appropriate practices to implement in their classrooms. These discoveries encourage and promote healthier learning styles and positive classroom atmospheres.

==== Observations of teachers completed by other professionals ====
Within the education system, there are a set of standards put in place by government officials. Teachers are responsible for following these academic standards as a guideline for developmentally appropriate instruction. Within following those academic goals, teachers are also observed by administrators to ensure positive classroom environments. One of the tools that teachers could be graded with is called the  nationally recognized CLASS tool. After using this tool "over 150 research studies prove that students in classrooms with high CLASS scores have better academic and social outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/178336659|title=Classroom assessment scoring system (CLASS) manual, toddler|last=La Paro|first=Karen M|last2=Hamre|first2=Bridget K|last3=Pianta|first3=Robert C|date=2012|publisher=Baltimore Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co|isbn=9781598572599|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;" (Touchstone Training, LLC., 2018). The tool itself is known for encouraging positive classroom environments, regard for the students perspectives, behavior management skills, quality of feedback, and language modeling. The administrators rate each of the ten categories with the number scale of one to seven. One being the lowest score and seven being the highest score that the teacher may receive. It is through tools such as this one that administrators are able to hold their teachers to high standards and ensure the best educational practices for the students.

==Exploration==
Discovery can also be used to describe the first incursions of peoples from one culture into the geographical and cultural environment of others. [[Western culture]] has used the term "discovery" in their histories to subtly emphasize the importance of "[[exploration]]" in the history of the world, such as in the "[[Age of Exploration]]".

A '''dystopia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δυσ- "bad" and τόπος "place"; alternatively, '''cacotopia''',&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 19th century works ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-03-19|df=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230])&lt;/ref&gt; '''kakotopia''', or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.&lt;ref name=Merriam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; It is translated as "not-good place" and is an [[antonym]] of [[utopia]], a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of his best known work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.

Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories [[setting (narrative)|set]] in the future. Some of the most famous examples are [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Dystopias are often characterized by [[dehumanization]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[science]], or [[technology]]. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been [[totalitarian]] states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.

It should be noted that some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas '''anti-utopias''' function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Utopia Reader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was deployed as an antonym for ''[[Utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches - Part I - November 1850 - November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hansard Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad"), reinterpreting the initial ''U'' as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable."&lt;ref name="Hermansson"&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."  The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]]: "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described."&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1818). ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by [[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', who said it was a better fit for Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' because "it sounds worse than dystopia".&lt;ref name="beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/summary/v073/73.2beaumont.html Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870-1900]. ''ELH, 73''(2): 465-487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Common theme==

===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff153&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff147&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealistic]] in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Utopia"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0-87436-757-3}} (10).  {{ISBN|978-0-87436-757-7}} (13).&lt;!--not verified.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron hand" or "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref name=Donawerth&gt;Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''; and in such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''.

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow.

A commonly occurring theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''Anthem'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind &amp;ndash; only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy. In ''Brave New World'', a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both byproducts of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', loosely based on Dick's novel).

====Social stratification====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the novel ''Brave New World'', written in 1931 by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts "mother" and "father" are considered obscene.  In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', children are organized to spy on their parents; and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'', for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', McClelland and Stewart, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7710-0813-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of this theme is [[Robert Hugh Benson]]'s ''[[Lord of the World]]'', about a futuristic world where the [[Freemasons]] have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a [[Roman Catholic]] minority.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.

In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.

===Violence===
[[Violence]] is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of [[war]] (e.g. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]''). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berne|first1=Suzanne|title=Patterns for College Writing|journal=Ground Zero|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatism and Utopia" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.{{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts. [[E. M. Forster]]'s "[[The Machine Stops]]" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/angulo/volumen/Volumen06-2/articulos05.htm|journal=Ángulo Recto.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''Soylent Green''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2002). Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.

“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, D. (2013, July 3). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Rosenbaum, R. (2013, January 1). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&amp;no-ist&lt;/ref&gt;''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Heitman, B. (2011, April 13). The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood.(Books)(Book review). The Christian Science Monitor, 146-150.&lt;/ref&gt;''
In his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

7. ''New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In a 1967 study [[Frank Kermode]] suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.&lt;ref name=jstor1/&gt;

In recent years there has seen a surge of popular dystopian [[young adult literature]] and blockbuster films.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Do We Love Dystopian Stories So Much?

You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of [[global warming|our planet warming up]]. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in."&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

Some have commented on this trend, saying that "it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the [[post-capitalism|end of capitalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Stephen|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Greg|title=From Belfast to Bamako: Cinema in the Era of Capitalist Realism|journal=Ireland and Cinema|date=1 January 2015|pages=107–116|doi=10.1057/9781137496362_10|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaviro|first1=Steven|title=Post Cinematic Affect|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=9781846944314|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=MetRyPdbh9QC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Kieran|title=Marx and the Alternative to Capitalism|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781312382626|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=khVdCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hassler-Forest|first1=Dan|title=Capitalist Superheroes: Caped Crusaders in the Neoliberal Age|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=9781780991795|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xFMEjZW-XTEC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Irby Jones''' (born December 23, 1927) is an American physician who was the first [[African American]] to be accepted as a non-segregated student at the [[University of Arkansas]] Medical School and the first black student to attend racially mixed classes in the [[Southern United States|American South]]. She was the first African American to graduate from a southern medical school, first black intern in the state of Arkansas, and later first black intern at [[Baylor College of Medicine]]. Jones was the first woman president of the [[National Medical Association]]. She has been honored by many awards, including induction into both the University of Arkansas College of Medicine Hall of Fame and the inaugural group of women inducted into the [[Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Edith Mae Irby was born on December 23, 1927, near [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]] in [[Faulkner County, Arkansas]], to Mattie (née Buice) and Robert Irby. At the age of eight, she lost her father, an older sister died at 12 years of age from [[typhoid fever]], and Irby herself suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] as a child. These were motivating factors in her desire to help those who were underserved and impoverished and which propelled her toward a career in medicine. Her mother relocated the family to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], where Irby graduated from Langston Secondary School in 1944. After winning a scholarship, she studied chemistry, biology and physics at [[Knoxville College]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=http://www.arwomenshalloffame.com/#/edith-jones/|publisher=Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irby was well aware of the role she was playing and obligation she had for the black community. One of her teachers had helped her attain the scholarship, members of the local African American community collected change and the black press ran a campaign in the ''[[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)#Arkansas State Press|Arkansas State-Press]]'' which they donated to help with her tuition and living expenses.&lt;ref name="National Library of Medicine bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_175.html|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Bethesda, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her schooling, she secretly made trips with teams of workers from the [[NAACP]] to enroll members for the organization.{{sfn|More|1999|p=237}} She graduated with her BS from Knoxville College in 1948 and then completed a graduate course at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to prepare for Medical School.&lt;ref name="graduation 1952"&gt;{{cite news|title=University to Graduate First Negro Student|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3893535/university_to_graduate_first_negro/|accessdate= December 26, 2015|work=Hope Star|date=May 19, 1952|location=Hope, Arkansas|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its final decade he emerged as an opponent of the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Single-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] dictatorship, becoming a member of the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic (''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR''/BEK)]].

==Life==
Neubert was born into the family of a Protestant minister in 1940 in [[Herschdorf]], a hillside village near [[Erfurt]] in central southern Germany. He grew up in nearby [[:de:Großenbehringen|Großenbehringen]]. Between 1958 and 1963 he studied [[Theology]] at [[University of Jena|Jena]]. After 1964 he worked at [[:de:Niedersynderstedt|Niedersynderstedt]] initially as a vicar and later as the minister in charge for the parish. From 1973 he was combining his parish duties with work as a [[:de:Studentenpfarrer|student chaplain]] at nearby [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; In 1976, probably on the advice of [[Robert Havemann]],&lt;ref name=ENlautEK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddr89.de/ddr89/personen/neubert_e.html|title=Ehrhart Neubert|work=DDR 1989/90|publisher=Erhard Kleps, Berlin|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]], in western Germany a political party of the moderate right, but in the politically and by this time physically [[Inner German border|separated]] eastern German state, one of the so-called "block parties" controlled by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party of Germany (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands''/SED)]] party through an organisation known as the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front (''Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''/NF)]]. In 1984 Neubert resigned from the CDU.&lt;ref name=ENlautrbb/&gt; In 1984 he became community sociology secretary in the Theology Studies department with the Berlin-based [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|East German League of Evangelical Churches]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt;

From 1967 Ehrhart Neubert was also taking part in various informal discussion groups, focusing on theology, sociology and the interface between them. He was sympathetic to the civil right demands of [[Robert Havemann]], who was seen by the regime as a high-profile political dissident. By 1979 Neubert was participating actively in Peace Groups of the [[:de:Evangelische Studierendengemeinde|Evangelical Students' Association]] and, during then 1980s, in other peace circles. He found himself increasingly in conflict both with the state authorities and with the inherently collaborationist leaderships of the official evangelical churches which were keen to retain a level of recognition and toleration from the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party leadership]]. Neubert also produced a number of quasi-political sociological and theological studies: some of his work appeared in [[West Germany]] under the pseudonym "'''Christian Joachim'''".&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt;

During [[Peaceful Revolution|East Germany's Peaceful Revolution]], Neubert was a co-founder of the [[Democratic Awakening]] movement, founded in 1989 in his apartment.&lt;ref name=spiegel452002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25604109.html|title= Karrieren: Angela rennt|date=4 November 2002|author=Matthias Geyer| volume=45/2002| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online) |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to the new party's programme and served as its first vice-chairman.&lt;ref name=spiegel452002/&gt; He represented [[Democratic Awakening]] at several of the [[East German Round Table]] sessions&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt; and served on various related investigatory commissions.&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; A (relatively) young fellow activist in Democratic Awakening was [[Angela Merkel]] who later became [[Chancellor of Germany]].&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt; Finding himself out of sympathy with what he saw at the time a shift towards the political right,&lt;ref name=ENlautWww&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=2485| publisher=Ch.

[[Image:Stelarc ArsElectronica97.jpg|thumb|[[Stelarc]] ''Parasite: Event for Invaded and Involuntary Body'', at the 1997 [[Ars Electronica]] Festival]]

'''Electronic art''' is a form of art that makes use of [[electronic media]]. More broadly, it refers to [[technology]] and/or [[electronic media]]. It is related to [[information art]], [[new media art]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], [[interactive art]], [[internet art]], and [[electronic music]]. It is considered an outgrowth of [[conceptual art]] and [[systems art]].

==Background==

The term ''electronic art'' is almost synonymous to [[computer art]] and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane 2006. ''Digital Art'', p. 10. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two terms, and especially the term [[computer-generated art]] are mostly used for visual artworks generated by computers. However, electronic art has a much broader connotation, referring to artworks that include any type of electronic component, such as works in [[music]], [[dance]], [[architecture]] and [[performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2006. ''Digital Art'', p. 132 Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field and so artists often collaborate with scientists and engineers when creating their works. The [[art historian]] of electronic art [[Edward A. Shanken]] works to document current and past experimental art with a focus on the intersection of art, science, and technology. Other writers on the topic of electronic art include [[Frank Popper]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Sarah Cook (curator)|Sarah Cook]], and [[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]].

Electronic art often features components of [[interactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2006). ''Digital Art'', pp. 8 &amp; 11. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists make use of technologies like the [[Internet]], [[computer network]]s, [[robotics]], wearable technology, [[digital painting]], [[wireless]] technology and [[immersive virtual reality]]. As the technologies used to deliver works of electronic art become [[obsolete]], electronic art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile electronic arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4077">'''Entitativity''' means the consideration of something as pure [[entity]], i.e., the mental [[abstraction]] from attendant circumstances.

In [[psychology]], it typically refers to ''the perception of a group as pure entity'' (an [[entitative]] group), abstracted from its attendant [[individual]]s. It is different{{how|date=May 2016}} from [[Holism|holistic]] [[perception]]. Operationally, entitativity can also be defined as ''perceiving a collection of social targets (e.g., individuals) as possessing unity and coherence (e.g., a group)''. Entitativity is highest for [[intimacy group]]s, such as the family, lower for [[action group (sociology)|task group]]s, lower yet for social categories (e.g., people of the same religion), and lowest for transitory groups, such as people waiting at the same bus stop (Lickel et al., 2000).

Campbell (1958) coined the term ''entitativity'' in order to explain why some groups are considered real groups while others are thought to be mere aggregates of individuals. He suggested that people rely on certain perceptual cues as they intuitively determine which aggregations of individuals are groups, and which are not (e.g. Spectators at a football game may seem like a disorganized collection of people, but when they shout the same cheers or express similar emotions, this gives them entitativity)(Forsyth, 2010). 

Additionally, Campbell (1958) emphasized three cues that individuals can use to make judgments regarding entitativity: ''common fate'' (the extent to which individuals in the aggregate seem to experience interrelated outcomes), ''similarity'' (the extent to which the individuals display the same behaviors or resemble one another), and ''proximity'' (the distance between individuals in the aggregate). To illustrate how we make those judgments, consider the example of people sharing a table at a library. They could be friends who are studying together, or they may also be strangers happening to share the same table. If you're wondering whether this is an actual group, you would examine their common fate, similarity, and proximity. Common fate may be something like the group all getting up and leaving together while talking or laughing amongst themselves. Similarity could be as simple as noticing that they are all using the same textbooks or notes, or that they happen to be wearing the same t-shirts to organizations (i.e., fraternity, university group). Finally, their physical proximity to one another (i.e., moving to sit closer) would be the final characteristic to judge that you are witnessing individuals with entitativity (Forsyth, 2010). 

There are two proposed antecedents for the entitativity perception ([https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=2006+Ip+Chiu+Wan&amp;btnG=Search Ip, Chiu, &amp; Wan, 2006]):
*physical similarity
*goal/behavior similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="994">The '''Field of Bullets''' hypothesis describes a model in which [[extinction]] is non-selective and occurs [[random]]ly.&lt;ref name=Raup&gt;Raup, David M.

Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-03008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor of the field of bullets suggest that [[species]] are simply out in a field and "bullets" are hitting them at random, thus their extinction is due only to [[stochastic]] effects.  The field of bullets operates without relation to the organisms' [[adaptability]], or fitness of specific animals. Under this hypothesis all species are subjugated to the same [[probability]] of extinction no matter where they originate in their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and irrespective of [[Trait (biology)|traits]] that typically buffer against extinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16441">In [[philosophy of mind]] and [[cognitive science]], '''folk psychology''', or '''commonsense psychology''', is a human capacity to explain and predict the [[behavior]] and [[Cognitive psychology|mental state]] of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/folkpsych-theory/ |title=Folk Psychology as a Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes and items encountered in daily life such as pain, pleasure, excitement, and anxiety use common linguistic terms as opposed to technical or scientific jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=H|title=Children's theories of mind|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the study of folk psychology has focused on how everyday people—those without formal training in the various academic fields of science—go about attributing mental states. This domain has primarily been centred on intentional states reflective of an individual's beliefs and desires; each described in terms of everyday language and concepts such as "beliefs", "desires", "fear", and "hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arico|first=Adam|title=Folk psychology, consciousness, and context effects|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|year=2010|volume=1|issue=3|pages=317–393|doi=10.1007/s13164-010-0029-9|url=https://www.lib.uwo.ca/cgi-bin/ezpauthn.cgi/docview/888751000?accountid=15115|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliminative materialism]] is the claim that folk psychology is false and should be discarded (or "eliminated").

==Key folk-concepts==

===Intentionality===
When perceiving, explaining, or criticizing [[human behaviour]], people distinguish between [[Volition (psychology)|intentional and unintentional action]]s.&lt;ref name="Malle 1997 101–121"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malle|first=Betram F|author2=Knobe, Joshua|title=The folk concept of intentionality|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=Mar 1997|volume=33|issue=2|pages=101–121|doi=10.1006/jesp.1996.1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evaluation of an action as stemming from purposeful action or accidental circumstances is one of the key determinants in social interaction. Others are the environmental conditions or pre-cognitive matters. For example, a critical remark that is judged to be intentional on the part of the receiver of the message can be viewed as a hurtful insult. Conversely, if considered unintentional, the same remark may be dismissed and forgiven.

This folk concept of intentionality is used to distinguish between intentional and unintentional behaviour in sports where intentional fouls are punished more harshly than ones deemed to be unintentional. It is also applied in the legal system in terms of criminal law distinguishing between murder and manslaughter.

The importance of this concept transcends almost all aspects of everyday life: with empirical studies in social and developmental psychology exploring perceived intentionality's role as a mediator for aggression, relationship conflict, judgments of responsibility blame or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karniol|first=Rachel|title=Children's use of intention cues in evaluating behaviour|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=Jan 1978|volume=85|issue=1|pages=76–85|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.1.76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Oxford|title=The Language and Thought of the Child, 1926; Judgment and Reasoning in the Child, 1928; The Child's Conception of the World, 1929; The Child's Conception of Physical Causality, 1930; The Moral Judgment of the Child, 1932.|year=1932|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|location=Oxford, England|pages=54–93|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/614996198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical literature on folk psychology has shown that people's theories regarding intentional actions involve four distinct factors: beliefs, desires, causal histories, and enabling factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malle|first=Betram F|author2=Knobe|title=The folk concept of intentionality|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=Mar 1997|volume=33|issue=2|pages=101–121|doi=10.1006/jesp.1996.1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, beliefs and desires represent the central variables responsible for the folk theories of intention.

Desires embody outcomes that an individual seeks, including those that are impossible to achieve.&lt;ref name=Kashima&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kashima|first=Yoshihisa|author2=McKintyre, Allison|author3=Clifford, Paul|title=The category of the mind: Folk psychology of belief, desire, and intention. Author|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=1 April 2000|volume=1|series=1|issue=3|pages=289–313|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference between desires and intentions is that desires can be purely hypothetical, whereas intentions specify an outcome that the individual is actually trying to bring to fruition.&lt;ref name="Kashima"/&gt;

In terms of beliefs, there are several types that are relevant to intentions—outcome beliefs and ability beliefs. Outcome beliefs are beliefs as to whether a given action will fulfill an intention, as in "purchasing a new watch will impress my friends".&lt;ref name="Malle 1997 101–121"/&gt; Ability consists of an actor's conviction regarding his or her ability to perform an action, as in " I really can afford the new watch". In light of this, Heider postulated that ability beliefs could be attributed with causing individuals to form goals that would not otherwise have been entertained.&lt;ref name="Heider 1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heider|first=F|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|year=1958|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehension and prediction===

====The Context Model====

Folk psychology is crucial to evaluating and ultimately understanding novel concepts and items. Developed by Medin, Altom, and Murphy, the Context Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D.L. |author2=Altom, M. W. |author3=Murphy, T.D.|title=Given versus induced category representations: Use of prototype and exemplar information in classification.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1984|volume=10|issue=333|page=352|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.3.333}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesizes that as a result of mental models in the form of prototype and exemplar representations, individuals are able to more accurately represent and comprehend the environment around them.

According to the model, the overall similarity between the prototype and a given instance of a category is evaluated based on multiple dimensions (e.g., shape, size, color). A multiplicative function modeled after this phenomenon was created.

:&lt;math&gt;s(P,E_i)=\prod_ks(P,E_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''S(P,Ei)'' represents the similarity between the prototype and the ''i''th exemplar, ''k'' is the subscript for the dimensions ''(k = 1…k)'', and ''S(P,Eik)'' is the similarity between the prototype and the ''i''th exemplar on the ''k''th dimension.

===Explanation===

====Hilton's (1990) Conversational Model====

Given that folk psychology represents [[causal knowledge]] associated with the mind's [[categorization]] processes, {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} it follows that folk psychology is actively employed in aiding the explanation of everyday actions. [[Denis Hilton]]'s (1990) Conversational Model was created with this causal explanation in mind, with the model having the ability to generate specific predictions. Hilton coined his model the 'conversational' model because he argued that as a social activity, unlike prediction, explanation requires an audience: to whom the individual explains the event or action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Denis J.|title=Conversational processes and causal explanation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=Jan 1990|volume=107|issue=1|pages=65–81|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.107.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, causal explanations follow two particular conversational maxims from Grice's (1975) models of conversation—the manner maxim and the quantity maxim. Grice indicated that the content of a conversation should be relevant, informative, and fitting of the audience's gap in knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grice|first=H Paul|title=Logic and Conversation|journal=Communications|year=1979|volume=30|pages=7–72|doi=10.3406/comm.1979.1446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognizant of this, the Conversational Model indicates that the explainer, upon evaluation of his audience, will modify his explanation to cater their needs. In essence, demonstrating the inherent need for mental comparison and in subsequent modification of behaviour in everyday explanations.

==Application and functioning==

===Belief-desire model===
The belief-desire model of psychology illustrates one method in which Folk Psychology is utilized in everyday life. According to this model, people perform an action if they want an outcome and believe that it can be obtained by performing the action. However, beliefs and desires are not responsible for immediate action; intention acts as a mediator of in this relationship belief-desire and action.&lt;ref name="Kashima"/&gt; In other words, a person who wants to achieve a goal, "G", and believes action "A" will aid in attaining "G"; this leads to an intention to perform "A", which is then carried out to produce action "A". [[File:Figure 2 - The Belief-Desire Model's relationship with Intention and Action2.png|thumb|Figure 2 - A schematic representation of folk psychology of belief, desire, intention, and action.]]

Schank &amp; Abelson (1977) described this inclusion of typical beliefs, desires, and intentions underlying an action as akin to a "script" whereby an individual is merely following an unconscious framework that leads to the ultimate decision of whether an action will be performed.&lt;ref name="Schank 1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schank|first=R.C.|title=Scripts, plans, goals and understanding|year=1977|publisher=Eribaum|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Barsalou (1985) described the category of the mind as an "ideal" whereby if a desire, a belief, and an intention were all present, they would "rationally" lead to a given action. They coined this phenomenon the Ideal of Rational Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barsalou|first=Lawrence W.|title=Ideals, central tendency, and frequency of instantiation as determinants of graded structure in categories.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=Oct 1985|volume=11|issue=4|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.11.1-4.629|pages=629–654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-intentional action model===
Existing literature has widely corroborated the fact that [[social behavior]] is greatly affected by the causes to which people attribute actions.&lt;ref name="Heider 1958"/&gt; In particular, it has been shown that an individual's interpretation of the causes of behaviour reflects their pre-existing beliefs regarding the actor's mental state and motivation behind his or her actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=B.|title=An attributional theory of motivation and emotion|year=1986|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that they draw on the assumed intentions of actors to guide their own responses to punish or reward the actor. This concept is extended to cover instances in which behavioural evidence is lacking. Under these circumstances, it has been shown that the individual will again draw on assumed intentions in order to predict the actions of the third party.&lt;ref name="Heider 1958"/&gt;

Although the two components are often used interchangeably in common parlance, there is an important distinction between the goals and intentions. This discrepancy lies in the fact that individuals with an intention to perform an action also foster the belief that it will be achieved, whereas the same person with a goal may not necessarily believe that the action is able to be performed in spite of having a strong desire to do so.

Predicting goals and actions, much like the Belief-Desire Model, involves moderating variables that determine whether an action will be performed. In the Goal-Intentional Action Model, the predictors of goals and actions are: the actors' beliefs about his or her abilities and their actual possession of preconditions required to actually carry out the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boonzaier|first=A. |author2=McClure, J. |author3=Sutton, R. M.|title=Distinguishing the effects of beliefs and preconditions: The folk psychology of goals and actions|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=725–740|doi=10.1002/ejsp.280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, preconditions consist of the various conditions necessary in order for realization of intentions. This includes abilities and skills in addition to environmental variables that may come into play. Schank &amp; Abelson raises the example of going to a restaurant, where the preconditions include the ability to afford the bill and get to the correct venue, in addition to the fact that the restaurant must be open for business.&lt;ref name="Schank 1977"/&gt; Traditionally, people prefer to allude to preconditions to explain actions that have a high probability of being unattainable, whereas goals tend to be described as a wide range of common actions.

===Model of everyday inferences===
Models of everyday inferences capture folk psychology of human informal reasoning. Many models of this nature have been developed. They express and refine our folk psychological ways of understanding of how one makes inferences.

For example, one model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sun|first=R. |title=Integrating Rules and Connectionism for Robust Commonsense Reasoning|year=1994|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes human everyday reasoning as combinations of simple, direct rules and similarity-based processes. From the interaction of these simple mechanisms, seemingly complex patterns of reasoning emerge. The model has been used to account for a variety of reasoning data.

==Controversy==
{{see|Eliminative materialism}}
Folk psychology remains the subject of much contention in academic circles with respect to its scope, method and the significance of its contributions to the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenweiser|first=A. A.|title=Folk-psychology|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1912|volume=9|issue=10|pages=373–380|doi=10.1037/h0074365}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}} A large part of this criticism stems from the prevailing impression that folk psychology is a primitive practice reserved for the uneducated and non-academics in discussing their everyday lives.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1995&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=G.|title=The scientific credibility of folk psychology |year=1995 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc. |location=Hilsdale, NJ |isbn=0805815708 |oclc=476199418 |ref=harvnb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate over whether folk psychology is useful for academic purposes; specifically, whether it can be relevant with regard to the scientific psychology domain. It has been argued that a mechanism used for laypeople's understanding, predicting, and explaining each other's actions is inapplicable with regards to the requirements of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Fletcher1995 /&gt; Conversely, opponents have called for patience, seeing the mechanism employed by laypeople for understanding each other's actions as important in their formation of bases for future action when encountering similar situations. Malle &amp; Knobe hailed this systematization of people's everyday understanding of the mind as an inevitable progression towards a more comprehensive field of psychology.&lt;ref name="Malle 1997 101–121"/&gt; Medin et al. provide another advantage of conceptualizing folk psychology with their Mixture Model of Categorization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|author2=Altom, M. W. |author3=Murphy, T.D. |title=Given versus induced category representations: Use of prototype and exemplar information in classification|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1984|volume=10|issue=3|pages=333–352|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.3.333}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is advantageous due to its facilitation of action prediction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24522">Images and  other stimuli contain both local features (details, parts) and global features (the whole). Precedence refers to the level of processing (global or local) to which attention is first directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://autismlab.psyc.sfu.ca/sites/default/files/documents/Dana%20A.%20Hayward%202012.pdf | title=Flexible visual processing in young adults with autism: the effects of implicit learning on a global-local task. |vauthors=Hayward DA, Shore DI, Ristic J, Kovshoff H, Iarocci G, Mottron L, Burack JA | journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=November 2012 | volume=42 | issue=11 | pages=2383–2392 | doi=10.1007/s10803-012-1485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Global precedence''' occurs when an individual more readily identifies the global feature when presented with a stimulus containing both global and local features.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  The global aspect of an object embodies the larger, overall image as a whole, whereas the local aspect consists of the individual features that make up this larger whole. Global processing is the act of processing a visual stimulus holistically. Although global precedence is generally more prevalent than local precedence, local preference also occurs under certain circumstances and for certain individuals.&lt;ref name=Himba&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=J.|author2=E. Fonteneau |author3=J. Fagot |title=Local and global processing: Observations from a remote culture|journal=Cognition|date=Sep 2008|volume=108|issue=3|pages=702–709|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.06.004|pmid=18662813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Global precedence is closely related to the  [[Principles of grouping|Gestalt principles of grouping]] in that the global whole is a grouping of proximal and similar objects. Within global precedence, there is also the global interference effect, which occurs when an individual is directed to identify the local characteristic, and the global characteristic subsequently interferes by slowing the reaction time.

==Basic methods==
Global precedence was first studied using the [[Navon figure]], where many small letters are arranged to form a larger letter that either does or does not match.&lt;ref name="Navon original"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navon|first=D.|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=Jul 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=353–383|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90012-3|title=Forest before trees: The precedence of global features in visual perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations of the original Navon figure include both shapes and objects.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli" /&gt;  
Individuals presented with a Navon figure will be given one of two tasks. In one type of task, participants are told before the presentation of the stimulus whether to focus on a global or local level, and their accuracy and reaction times are recorded.

[[File:Targetstimulus.png|thumb]]
In another type of task, participants are first presented with a target stimulus, and later presented with two different visuals. One of the visuals matches the target stimulus on the global level, while the other visual matches the target stimulus on the local level. In this condition, experimenters note which of the two visuals, the global or local, is chosen to match the target stimulus.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;

==Specific results and theories==

===Navon's original study===
In general, reaction time for identifying the larger letter is faster than for the smaller letters that make up the shape.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Navon directed participants to focus either globally or locally to stimuli that were consistent, neutral, or conflicting on the global and local levels (see figures above).&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Reaction time for global identification was much faster than for local identification, showing global precedence.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Additionally, global interference effect, which occurs when the global aspect is automatically processed even when attention is directed locally, causes slow reaction time.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Navon's study  global precedence and his stimuli, or variations of it, are still used in nearly all global precedence experiments.

===Racial differences===
When presented with a Navon figure, there is a slight local preference for Caucasians, but East Asians show an obvious global preference and are faster and more accurate at global processing.&lt;ref name=Race&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKone|first=E.|author2=Davies, A.A. |author3=Fernando, D. |author4=Aalders, R. |author5=Leung, H. |author6=Wickramariyaratne, T. |author7=Platow, M.J. |title=Asia has the global advantage: Race and visual attention|journal=Vision Research|date=July 2010|volume=50|issue=16|pages=1540–1549|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.05.010 |pmid=20488198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclination towards global precedence is also evident in second generation Asian-Australians, but the correlation is weaker than that of recent immigrants.  This could stem from the physical environment of East Asian versus Western cities, as the level of visual complexity varies across these environments.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt; The tendency of Caucasians to process information "analytically" and Asians "holistically" has also been attributed to differences in brain structure.&lt;ref name="Chee, Michael Wei Liang, et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chee | first1 = M. W. L. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = H. | last3 = Goh | first3 = J. O. S. | last4 = Park | first4 = D. | last5 = Sutton | first5 = B. P. | year = 2011 | title = Brain structure in young and old East Asians and Westerners: comparisons of structural volume and cortical thickness | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 1065–1079 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2010.21513 | pmid=20433238 | pmc=3361742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some cognitive scientists, the stark contrast in cognitive processing trends across cultures and races suggests that all studies on cognitive perception should report participants’ races to ensure valid theoretical conclusions.  Especially in experiments involving spatially distributed stimuli, neglected racial or cultural differences in visual perception could skew results.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt;

===Cultural differences===
Global precedence is not a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

When Navon figure stimuli are presented to participants from a remote African culture, the [[Himba people|Himba]], local precedence is observed although the Himba show the capabilities for both global and local processing.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

This difference in precedence for Navon figure stimuli can be attributed to cultural differences in occupations, or in the practice of reading and writing. This finding dispels the idea that local precedence is a consequence or symptom of disorders, since the Himba is a normally functioning society capable of both global and local processing.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

===Varying stimuli===
Stimuli are either meaningful or meaningless. For example, letters and familiar objects, like a cup, are meaningful, while unidentifiable and non-geometric forms are not. In both types of stimuli, the global advantage is observed, but the global interference effect only occurs with meaningful stimuli.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poirel|first=N.|author2=A. Pineau |author3=E. Mellet |title=What does the nature of the stimuli tell us about the global precedence effect?|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2008|volume=127|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, when the global object is meaningful, the reaction time for identification of the local feature increases.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:meaningless stimulus.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;

This supports the theory that within global precedence, global advantage and global interference rely on two separate mechanisms. Global-local interference occurs as a result of [[Automaticity|automatic processing]] of global objects. The theory is that the global precedence effect has a [[Sensory system|sensory]] mechanism active in global advantage, whereas automatic and semantic processes are active in the interference effect.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"/&gt;

===Age===
Cognitive processing varies across different age groups, and several studies have been done using Navon-like figures to examine the correlation between precedence and age.

====Children and Adolescents====
When presented with a global-local task, children and adolescents exemplify a local bias.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherf|first=K.S.|author2=Behrmann, M. |author3=Kimchi, R. |author4=Luna, B. |title=Emergence of Global Shape Processing Continues Through Adolescence|journal=Child Development|date=Jan–Feb 2009|volume=80|issue=1|pages=162–177|jstor=29738604|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01252.x |pmid=19236399 |pmc=2648130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Younger children respond slower to different types of stimuli compared to older children, and thus local precedence seems more prevalent than global precedence in perceptual organization, at least until adolescence, when the transition to globally oriented visual perception begins.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"/&gt;  The ability to encode a global shape, which is necessary for efficiently recognizing and identifying objects, increases with age.  However, it has also been found that there is a bias towards global information during infancy, which may be based upon high spatial frequency information, as well as limited vision.  Therefore, global precedence during the early years of life may not be upwards but rather a U-shaped development.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"/&gt;

====Aging====
There is a decline of global precedence in older subjects.&lt;ref name=Aging&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staudinger|first=M.R.|author2=Fink, G.R. |author3=Mackay, C.E. |author4=Lux, S. |title=Gestalt perception and the decline of global precedence in older subjects.|journal=Cortex|date=Jul–Aug 2011|volume=47|issue=7|pages=854–862|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2010.08.001 |pmid=20828678}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When presented with a Navon-like figures, young adults demonstrate global precedence enhancement in that when the number of local letters forming the global letter increases, their global precedence increases. On the other hand, there is no precedence effect or enhancement for older subjects when presented with the same task.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt; This links global precedence to the Gestalt principles of Proximity and Continuity, and suggests that Gestalt-related deficiencies, such as decline in perceptual grouping, may underlie the decline of global precedence in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt;

Global precedence decline may also relate to hemispheric specialization.  The spatial frequency theory proposes that global versus local information is processed through two “channels” of low (global) versus high (local) spatial frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=G.L.|title=The role of spatial-frequency channels in the perception of local and global structure.|journal=Perception|year=1986|volume=15|pages=259–273|doi=10.1068/p150259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[spatial frequency]] measures how often a stimulus moves through space. Based upon this theory, the double frequency theory links the left hemisphere with high spatial frequencies, leading to a global precedence effect, and the right hemisphere with low spatial frequencies, leading to a local precedence effect.  This suggests neuropsychological factors behind global precedence decline in there may be faster aging in the right than the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt;

===Affect===
Studies regarding mood have shown that positive and negative cues can influence global versus local attention during image-based tasks.

====Self-generated emotional primes====
Some studies have shown that positive priming decreases local response time, demonstrating a lessening effect of global precedence, while negative priming increases local response time.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumann|first=N.|author2=J. Kuhl|title=Positive affect and flexibility: overcoming the precedence of global over local processing of visual information|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123–134|doi=10.1007/s11031-005-7957-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood dictates one's preferences for processing type.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood" /&gt;

The result that negative priming reduces flexibility correlates to the [[Psi-Theory|Psi theory]] states that negative emotion inhibits one’s access to extension memory, reducing [[cognitive flexibility]]. This also supports the theory that positive affect increases cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood" /&gt;

====Standardized emotional primes====
Positive mood priming also increases cognitive flexibility when prime words do not have individualistic specificity and when primes are visual.&lt;ref name="Priming and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=H.K. |author2=G.V. Jones |author3=D.G. Watson|title=Encouraging the perceptual underdog: Positive affective priming of nonpreferred local–global processes|journal=Emotion|year=2009|volume=9|issue=2|pages=238–247|doi=10.1037/a0014713}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive affect does not simply promote local processing, but rather improves one’s abilities in his non-preferred dimension.&lt;ref name="Priming and global precedence" /&gt;  For example, one preferring the local aspect of stimuli would show increased performance in identifying the global aspect and vice versa. This further supports the cognitive flexibility theory.

However, many studies regarding global processing and affect conflict with each other. One particular study showed that individuals in happy moods are more likely than those in sad moods to identify images based on global attributes rather than local ones, contrary to other studies that have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Mood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gasper|first=K.|author2=Clore, G.L.|title=Attending the Big Picture: Mood and Global versus Local Processing of Visual Information|journal=Psychological Science|date=January 2002|volume=13|issue=1|pages=34–40|jstor=40063692|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00406}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Paying attention to global features is the standard strategy for visual processing.  Therefore, if positive feelings are more frequent than negative feelings, and thus positive feelings are more accessible, then positive feelings should instigate global processing more than negative feelings because the global strategy is similarly more accessible.&lt;ref name="Mood"/&gt;  From a more worldly application, positive affect might aid in understanding the larger meaning of stimuli like literature or art, whereas negative affect might aid understanding more minute details within those stimuli, like particularly rhythmic words or the nuance of colors.&lt;ref name="Mood"/&gt;

===Faces===

====Navon bias====
Priming with Navon figures aides the recognition of faces, a holistic task, when the response elicited from the figure matches the precedence of the figure.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perfect|first=T.J. |author2=N.J. Weston |author3=I. Dennis |author4=A. Snell|title=The effects of precedence on Navon-induced processing bias in face recognition|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2008|volume=61|issue=10|pages=1479–1486|doi=10.1080/17470210802034678}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, if the stimulus has local precedence and the participant is cued to respond with the local feature identification, his accuracy in facial recognition improves. The same occurs when global responses are asked of global stimuli.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt;

When a facial task requires local processing for identification, participants’ facial recognition improves when they must respond to global precedence stimuli with local responses and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt; They are forced to show cognitive flexibility in their responses to the Navon figure primes.

One theory explains that normal facial recognition requires automatic processes, whereas special facial recognition requires controlled processes.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt;  Automatic processes are aided by correlative stimuli and responses, while controlled processes are aided by stimuli and responses that do not correlate. This indicates that facial recognition depends on type of attention, automatic or controlled, rather than focus on global or local features.

====Face inversion====
When identifying inverted faces, those showing stronger global precedence show a more prominent&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=D.|author2=C.N. Macrae|title=Processing style and person recognition: Exploring the face inversion effect|journal=Visual Cognition|year=2010|volume=18|issue=2|pages=161–170|doi=10.1080/13506280902868793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those showing a stronger global precedence also have a greater deficit in identification abilities when the faces are inverted; their identification abilities decrease more from upright identification to inverted identification than weak global precedence individuals.&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence" /&gt;

This correlates to the theory that upright faces are processed holistically, or with a special mechanism.&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence" /&gt;  Those with stronger global precedence should perform better at holistically processing a face upright. Stronger global precedence should show a greater decrease in accuracy of identification of inverted faces because the task relies on local processing.

===Individual characteristics===
The degree of global precedence one demonstrates has been found to differ in relation to the variable of an individual's [[field dependence]].&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poirel|first=N.|author2=A. Pineau |author3=G. Jobard |author4=E. Mellet |title=Seeing the forest before the trees depends on individual field-dependency characteristics|journal=Experimental Psychology|year=2008|volume=55|issue=5|pages=328–333|doi=10.1027/1618-3169.55.5.328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Field dependency is the amount that one relies on Gestalt laws of perceptual organization. High field dependency corresponds to a greater bias toward the global level, while field independence corresponds to a lesser dependency on the global level.&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"/&gt;

This indicates that individual characteristics have an effect on the prevalence of global precedence and that global and local processing exist on a continuum.&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"/&gt;

===Physiological explanation===
Neuropsychological evidence based on PET scans suggests that the global aspect of visual situations activates and is processed preferentially by the [[right hemisphere]], whereas the local aspect of visual situations activates and is processed preferentially by the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=hemispheres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fink|first=J.C.|author2=Marshall, P.W. |author3=Halligan, C.D. |author4=Frith, R.S.J. |author5=Frackowiak, R. |title=Hemispheric Specialization for Global and Local Processing: The Effect of Stimulus Category|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=Apr 1997|volume=264|issue=1381|pages=487–494|jstor=50536 .|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0070|pmc=1688391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The classical view of [[Gestalt psychology]] also suggests the right hemisphere is involved in the perception of wholes and thus plays a stronger role in global processing, whereas the left hemisphere involves separate local elements and therefore plays a stronger role in local processing.&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt;

However, hemispheric specialization is relative because it depends on the experimental setting as well as the individual’s “attentional set.”&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt; In addition, stimulus type may influence the neural structures underlying hemispheric specialization. Global processing is the default strategy for most individuals, but local stimuli are often more perceptually demanding to recognize and identify, showing the effect of stimuli on visual processing.&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt;

==Disorders==
The Navon figure has been used in relating theories regarding processing to assessing cognitive learning disabilities, such as [[Dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], [[dyscalculia]], [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]], and [[autism]].

===Dyslexia===
When given a Navon figure test, people with dyslexia have difficulty automatically identifying [[grapheme]]s with [[phoneme]]s, but not with identifying numbers with magnitudes.&lt;ref name=Dyslexia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubinsten|first=O.|author2=Henik, A.|title=Double dissociation of functions in developmental dyslexia and dyscalculia.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=November 2006|volume=98|issue=4|pages=854–867|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.4.854}}&lt;/ref&gt;    On the other hand, people with dyscalculia have difficulty automatically identifying numbers with magnitudes, but not letters and with phonemes.  This suggests a dissociation between subjects with dyslexia and dyscalculia.  These developmental learning disabilities do not cause general problems with identifying symbols to their mental representations, but rather create specific challenges.&lt;ref name="Dyslexia"/&gt;

===Obsessive compulsive disorder===
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) subjects are prone to be distracted by the local aspects of stimuli when asked to identify global aspects of figures such as the Navon figure.&lt;ref name=Obsessive-compulsive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yovel|first=I.|author2=Revelle, W. |author3=Mineka, S. |title=Who Sees Trees before Forest? The Obsessive-Compulsive Style of Visual Attention|journal=Psychological Science|date=February 2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=123–129|jstor=40064188|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00792.x|pmid=15686578}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is likely because individuals with OCPD characteristically have sharp, detail-oriented attentions, and tend to focus more on specifics rather than the larger context.&lt;ref name="Obsessive-compulsive"/&gt;

===Autism===
There are correlations between global or local performance on a task and the abilities to identify emotion and [[canine age]] for autistic children.&lt;ref name=Autism&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=T.F.|title=Global-Local Precedence in the Perception of Facial Age and Emotional Expression by Children with Autism and other Developmental Disabilities|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=Dec 2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=773–785|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0023-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, global responses correlate to better identification.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  In general, autistic children demonstrate much weaker global precedence than those without the disorder.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  Within the group of autistic children, those who respond more globally to a discrimination task perform better on emotion and canine age tasks.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;

One explanation is a possible biological dysfunction in the brain region where facial processing occurs. Research indicates that global processing, facial recognition, and emotional expression recognition are all linked to the [[right hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  A defect in that area would explain the characteristics of autism. For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with autism see the autism and facial recognition section of [[face perception]].

An '''insult''' is an expression or statement (or sometimes behavior) which is [[Respect|disrespectful]] or scornful. Insults  may be intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; An insult may be [[fact]]ual, but at the same time [[pejorative]], such as the word "[[Inbreeding|inbred]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Vos|first1=George|title=Status inequality: the self in culture|date=1990|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jocular exchange==

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered insults a primary form of [[social interaction]], central to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary order]] – "a situation that is symbolised in the 'Yah-boo, so are you' of the transitivist quarrel, the original form of aggressive communication".{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- WTF with this transitivist yah-boo? This is encyclopedia, supposed to explain things, not for wisecracks--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] points out that every "crack or remark set up the possibility of a counter-riposte, topper, or squelch, that is, a comeback".&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; He cites the example of possible interchanges at a dance in a school gym:
{{quotation|
* A one-liner:  Boy: "Care to dance?" Girl: "No, I came here to play basketball" Boy: "Crumbles"
* A comeback:  Boy: "Care to dance?" Girl: "No, I came here to play basketball" Boy: "Sorry, I should have guessed by the way you're dressed".&lt;ref&gt;''Mad'', quoted in Goffman, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Backhanded compliment}} Backhanded compliments ==

Backhanding is referred to as [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]] someone using the back of the hand instead of the palm—that is generally a symbolic, less forceful blow.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}} Correspondingly, a backhanded (or left-handed) compliment, or [[wikt:asteism|asteism]], is an insult that is disguised as, or accompanied by, a [[wikt:compliment|compliment]], especially in situations where the belittling or condescension is intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded |title=Backhanded — Definition of Backhanded at Dictionary.com: |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211212617/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded| archivedate= 11 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of backhanded compliments include, but not limited to:

*"I did not expect you to ace that exam. Good for you.", which could impugn the target's success as a fluke.&lt;ref name=AboutRela&gt;{{cite web|last=Burbach|first= Cherie|title=Backhanded Compliment. About Relationships. n.d. |website=about.com|accessdate=2 January 2015 |url=http://friendship.about.com/od/Friendship_Definitions/g/Backhanded-Compliment.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"That skirt makes you look far thinner.", insinuating hidden fat.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;
*"I wish I could be as straightforward as you, but I always try to get along with everyone.", insinuating an overbearing attitude.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;
*"I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger person.", insinuating decline with age.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;

==Sexual==

Verbal insults often take [[Prick (slang)|a phallic form]]; this includes offensive [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Renold, ''Girls, Boys, and Junior Sexualities'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and may also include insults to ones [[sexuality]].

==Formal==

The [[flyting]] was a formalized sequence of literary insults: invective or flyting, the literary equivalent of the spell-binding curse, uses similar incantatory devices for opposite reasons, as in [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]]'s ''Flyting with Kennedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973 )p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

"A little-known survival of the ancient 'flytings', or contests-in-insults of the Anglo-Scottish bards, is the type of [[xenophobic]] humor once known as 'water wit' in which passengers in small boats crossing the [[Thames]] ... would insult each other grossly, in all the untouchable safety of being able to get away fast."&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol I (1973) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson]] once triumphed in such an exchange: "a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery, Johnson answered him thus, 'Sir, your wife, ''under pretence of keeping a bawdy-house'', is a receiver of stolen goods.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomies==
[[File:Uwot.jpg|thumb|The use of the [[V sign]] as an insult, combined with the upwards swing movement]]

Various typologies of insults have been proposed over the years. [[Ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]], noting that "almost any action can operate as an Insult Signal if it is performed out of its appropriate context – at the wrong time or in the wrong place", classes such signals in ten 'basic categories":&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''Manwatching'' (London 1987) p. 186-192. {{ISBN|9780810913103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Disinterest signals
# Boredom signals
# Impatience signals
# Superiority signals
# Deformed-compliment signals
# Mock-discomfort signals
# Rejection signals
# Mockery signals
# Symbolic insults
# Dirt signals

[[Elizabethans]] took great interest in such analyses, distinguishing out, for example, the "fleering frump ... when we give a mock with a scornful countenance as in some smiling sort looking aside or by drawing the lip awry, or shrinking up the nose".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Puttenham]] in Boris Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 72=3&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare humerously set up an insult-hierarchy of seven-fold "degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Shakespeare]]. ''[[As You Like It]]'', Act V, Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions==

What qualifies as an insult is also determined both by the individual social situation and by changing social [[mores]]. Thus on one hand the insulting "obscene invitations of a man to a strange girl can be the spicy endearments of a husband to his wife".&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1200">'''Jing''' ({{zh|s=敬|t=敬|p=Jìng}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] which is typically translated as "reverence." It is often used by [[Confucius]] in the term ''gōngjìng'' ({{zh|恭敬}}), meaning "respectful reverence". The Confucian notion of respect has been likened to the later, western [[Immanuel Kant#Moral philosophy|Kantian]] notion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Robin S., "Respect", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/respect/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For Confucians, ''jìng'' requires ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'', or righteousness, and a proper observation of rituals (''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]''). To have ''jìng'' is vitally important in the maintenance of ''[[xiào]]'', or filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;Richey, J. (2005). Confucius, in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

'''Kammaññatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "wieldiness", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāya-kammaññatā'' - wieldiness of mental body (or "wieldiness of cetisakas")
* ''Citta-kammaññatā'' - wieldiness of consciousness (or "wieldiness of citta")

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of unwieldiness (''akammaññabhāva'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2370-2373}}
:The twofold wieldiness has the characteristic of the subsiding of unwieldiness (akammaññabhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unwieldiness. It is manifested as success of the mental body and consciousness in making something an object. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to the remaining hindrances, which create unwieldiness of the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|pp=227-228}}
:Kammaññatā can be translated as wieldiness or workableness. The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that they suppress unwieldiness in cetasikas and citta, and that they should be regarded as “bringing faith in objects of faith, and patient application in works of advantage, and are like purity of gold.”
:When there is wieldiness, citta and cetasikas are like gold which has been made workable. The ''Mula-Tīkā'' expresses this as follows:
::Workableness signifies that specific or suitable degree of pliancy or softness which makes the gold, that is, the mind, workable. While the mind is in the flames of passion it is too soft to be workable, as molten gold is. If, on the contrary, the mind is too rigid then it is comparable to untempered gold.
:Wieldiness is the opponent of the “[[Five hindrances|hindrances]]”, such as sensuous desire (''kamacchanda'') and anger or hate (''vyapada''), which cause mental unwieldiness.

'''Marse Callaway''' (born 1888) known as (Mr. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) was a black political boss and founder of the Baltimore Police Training School, a black [[policeman]]'s training academy in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Governor Helps Bury 'Mr. GOP': 400 Others Attend Calloway Funeral"|last=|first=|date=May 31, 1952| pages= 1-2.|work=The Baltimore Afro-American|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=CALLAWAY, GOP LEADER, DEAD: Fought For Negro Representation In Political Posts|last=|first=|date=May 20, 1952, p. 18.|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as the President of an organization{{which|date=March 2017}} which aimed to bring together Republican [[Voting|voters]], improve voter registration rates especially for the Republican party and to ensure the wellbeing of black people overall.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Callaway was a [[real estate]] broker and an influential figure in Republican Politics in Maryland. In 1923 when he became president of the [[Baltimore]] Republican Party. In 1935, Callaway led a lobbying effort to persuade the Maryland legislature to study the question of whether to make the historically black Morgan College a state institution. A legislative commission ended up making a recommendation in favor of transferring Morgan to the state of Maryland, a move that was finalized in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Marse Callaway: A Master Politician|last=Levin|first=Harry|date=February 8, 1958, p.

He was sentenced to a three-year [[suspended sentence]] and when summing up Judge Robert France asserted that Callaway had been "a respected and outstanding citizen in his own community and the city of Baltimore".  Callaway was also ordered to pay restitution.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[File:Richard Everitt from family photo album.jpg|thumb|Richard Everitt]]
On 13 August 1994, 15-year-old '''Richard Everitt''' was stabbed to death in [[London]] in a racially motivated attack. Everitt's neighbourhood, [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]], had been the site of ethnic tensions, and although he was not involved in gangs, he was murdered by a gang of [[British Bangladeshi]]s who were seeking revenge on another [[White British]] boy. 

The murderer was not apprehended, as members of the gang fled to Bangladesh. Badrul Miah and Showat Akbar were tried in 1995 as the ringleaders of the gang and were given life sentences, with minimum terms of 12 years and three years in custody respectively.

==Background==
Somers Town, in the [[London Borough of Camden]], was experiencing [[urban decay]] in the early 1990s. Many of its white families had been moved onto newer estates, and the ones who remained lived in poverty and unemployment, and felt in conflict with Bengalis. Bengalis were living in the neighbourhood's worst housing, with problems of overcrowding due to their larger-than-average families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White youths and Bengali youths respectively chose to attend different schools and youth clubs, and interracial relationships were shunned.&lt;ref name=indy1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braid|first1=Mary|title=Fear and loathing after 'racial' murder: Gangs of teenagers have vowed to avenge the death of a white schoolboy stabbed by a group of Asians in Somers Town, north London, on Saturday.

Richard Everitt attended [[South Camden Community School (SCCS)|South Camden Community School]], where the ethnic tensions continued, although he was not involved in them. His mother had previously complained when he was allegedly threatened with a knife by an Asian pupil.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

==Murder==
On the night of 13 August 1994, Everitt returned from playing football to ask for permission to go to [[Burger King]] with his friends. They encountered a gang of fifteen Bengali youths aged 18–19 and began to run, but Everitt was caught and stabbed with a seven-inch kitchen knife in his shoulder blades, piercing his heart. His friends notified his parents, who came to him as he was loaded into the ambulance. Everitt died at the hospital.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaffrey|first1=Julie|title=Exclusive: I can't forgive my son's knife crime killer|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/exclusive-i-cant-forgive-my-sons-knife-347352|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Eleven men were arrested and [[bail]]ed shortly after Everitt was stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Ian|title=Race motive suspected in murder of white boy: Friends find teenager stabbed in street|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/race-motive-suspected-in-murder-of-white-boy-friends-find-teenager-stabbed-in-street-1383575.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2011 |origyear= 14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began on 5 October 1995 at the [[Old Bailey]]. On 1 November, Badrul Miah was found guilty of conspiring to murder Everitt and was given a 'life' sentence with a minimum of 12 years in prison; Showat Akbar was found guilty of violent disorder and sentenced to three years' youth detention. Their gang had been seeking revenge on a white teenager suspected of stealing their jewellery, and Miah boasted that he had "stabbed up a white boy". Miah and Akbar were deemed by the judge to have been the ringleaders of the attack, but she stated that the identity of the killer was unknown as some of the gang members had fled to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKie|first1=John|title=Gang leader gets life for killing boy|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gang-leader-gets-life-for-killing-boy-1536715.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|date=1 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Miah was given four days' unsupervised release to attend his sister's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race killer freed for party|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/44051/Race-killer-freed-for-party.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Everitt's murder was received with shock in Somers Town. A Bengali teenager told ''[[The Independent]]'' "The boy seems to have had nothing to do with trouble. We are so shocked that Bengali boys could do this. It is the innocent increasingly who are suffering".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; The Deputy Headmaster of Everitt's school told the press that cohesion was generally good at the school.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; Jalal Uddin, a Bengali activist, spoke of his fears that revenge attacks could continue perpetually.&lt;ref name=news/

A [[Halal]] butcher's was firebombed, and white gangs attacked Bengalis.&lt;ref name=indy2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengalis told family members to stay indoors, and the police increased their presence in order to combat the gangs.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; A white gang member said that he would not accept support from the [[British National Party]] because "the BNP comes down here, gets everyone whipped up and then when the trouble starts we get it and they run away".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

After the convictions, Everitt's family were abused by Bengali neighbours, and moved to [[Essex]] before settling in [[Haworth]], [[West Yorkshire]]. His mother successfully campaigned for stronger sentences for [[knife legislation|knife crime]].&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

The murder was mentioned by ''[[India Today]]'' as attributable to a decline in values among [[British Asian]] youth, who were previously considered a [[model minority]] but were becoming increasingly involved with drugs and gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merchant|first1=Khozem|title=Immigrant gangland|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/asian-youths-turn-to-drugs-gangs-and-crime-in-london/1/294235.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=15 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In response to Everitt's murder, the KXL Camden United project was founded using football to bring young people together. The football team is for players aged 15 to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sport_relief/2122579.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Sport Relief - Community team scores a winner|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] activist Alan Walter launched Camden Action Now alongside Everitt's parents, offering youth activities and aiming to unite the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/16/alan-walter-obituary|title=Alan Walter|first=Austin|last=Mitchell|date=16 March 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Myth of Redemptive Violence''' is an archetypal [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in [[literature]], especially in [[empire|imperial]] cultures.  One of the oldest versions of this story is the [[creation myth]] of [[Babylon]] (the [[Enûma Elish]]) from around 1250 B.C.  [[Walter Wink]] coined the term as part of an analysis of its impact on modern culture and its role in maintaining oppressive power structures in his book ''The Powers That Be''.

==Narrative and effect==
While contrasting the Enûma Elish with the [[Genesis creation myth]] found in the [[Book of Genesis]], Wink examines the psychological effects of each phase of the story.  He asserts that every phase of the narrative serves to reinforce the ideology of the status quo and convince us to perpetuate the ruling power structure:

===Primal chaos===
The primacy of [[Tiamat]] suggests that chaos and evil are the original and natural state of the universe.  This can be used to convince us to fear and oppose any threat to the current order, under the assumption that things can only get worse.  Superheroes especially have dark origins (for example, the murder of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s parents and the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|planet Krypton]]), and the pervasiveness of evil is depicted by the resurrection of villains in [[horror movies]] and [[cartoons]], the exaggerated presence of violent crime in [[news]] coverage, and the overwhelming number and variety of bad creatures in [[The Lord of the Rings]].

===Tammuz===
Tiamat and her allies oppress the other gods, who, at first, seem powerless to resist.  This acknowledges the effectiveness of alternative systems, and gives us the guilty pleasure of vicariously harming our "betters" and breaking their rules.  However, all this is constrained by the exaggerated flaws of the antagonists, which foreshadow their failure and make us ashamed to identify with them.  [[Horror films]] tend to emphasize this part of the narrative to the extreme, whereas [[superhero]] stories often marginalize it.

===Heroism===
[[Marduk]] offers to defeat Tiamat in exchange for absolute rule over the remaining gods, and they all agree.  This elevates "[[might makes right]]" to a contract made at the beginning of the universe.  People are inclined to identify with the hero because of his privileges and his good attributes, and to sympathize with any subsequent oppression.  Modern examples include [[James Bond]]'s license to kill, the gold mine given to [[Doc Savage]]'s father, Friday's loyalty to [[Robinson Crusoe]], the brazen dishonesty of [[Jedi]] knights, the extremes of [[Jack Bauer]], etc.

===Triumph===
Marduk slays his enemies in creative, gory, and intricate ways, then goes on to enslave their underlings.  This shows that good prevails and evil suffers; the corollary to this is that those who prevail are good.  This gives us the catharsis of vengeance and indignation.  Once again we can sadistically enjoy a character's suffering, but this time in a sanctioned, acceptable context.  The spectacular downfall and glorious victory prompt us to reject the antagonist and  reaffirm our commitment to the winning party, respectively.  [[Action movies]] and [[video games]] tend to have a decisive final battle.  An opposition leader's death scene often includes ridiculously thorough destruction of his or her body, property, and/or organization, such as [[Julius No|Dr. No]] drowning in the core of his nuclear reactor, which then melts down.

===Redemption===
Marduk makes the world from Tiamat's corpse and humanity from the blood of [[Kingu]].  This leaves us with the message that our prosperity and even our very existence required past violence and destruction; as Wink puts it, "We are the outcome of deicide."  This helps justify recent and ongoing violence by appealing to our self-interest.  The death or defeat of the antagonist tends to be immediately followed by an idyllic happy ending in simple, violent plots of all stripes.  Current examples include the [[Ewok]] percussion instrument made from [[Imperial stormtrooper|Storm Trooper]] and other Imperial helmets (or heads) at the end of [[Return of the Jedi]], and the brain surgery Doc Savage uses to turn criminals into productive citizens.

==Opposing views==
Traditionally, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have noted that myths transmit elements of culture and shape the listener's worldview without making value judgments as to the merit of a given culture or the validity of its worldview.  Wink's analysis is predicated on the notion that Babylonian society and pagan religion, as well as Western society and popular culture, are intrinsically less valid than his notion of first century [[Christian]] society and "pure" [[monotheism]].

It has also been postulated that the creation story of Genesis was developed in reaction to earlier stories, including the Enûma Elish, since the stories share common elements that other creation beliefs lack.  Adherents of [[meme]] theory see the similarity as more fundamental: each story advocates a certain power structure, which has led people in power to support the story that favors them, often oppressively and often using violence.  Whether or not a myth directly advocates violence and oppression, it may still foster misery and destruction.

== The Two Brothers ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=needs proper citations &amp; formatting|date=October 2014}}

The [[Tale of Two Brothers]] is an ancient Egyptian story from around the 13th century BCE. The narrative is preserved on the [[Papyrus D'Orbiney]]. [Tale of Two Brothers] which had belonged to Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty when he was crown prince [William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Egyptian Tales: Translated from the Papyri, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;66 ] and may have been a political satire based in part on his own difficulties with his half brother, the usurper Amenmesse[J. H. Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, §§ 239ff. ], but the historical facts concerning this period are so uncertain as to render such a conclusion speculative. The text has similarities to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20, however the relation between the two texts is unclear, if, indeed, there is one.[Shaw, Ian. &amp; Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.&amp;nbsp;54. The British Museum Press, 1995] Further elements of the story seem to be derived from the myths concerning Osiris' death and resurrection.[Erman, Adolph. Life in Ancient Egypt. p.&amp;nbsp;379. Dover Publications, 1971. ] The protagonists Anpu and Bata both bear names of gods of the 17th nome of Upper Egypt.

===Synopsis===
Bata lives with his married brother Anpu. One day, when Anpu is not at home, his wife tries to seduce Bata, and, having been repelled, accuses Bata of having made advances towards her. Anpu grows angry and wants to kill his younger brother who flees. Pre-Harakhte saves him by creating a body of water full of crocodiles between him and his brother. Bata tells his brother what has occurred and, as proof of his sincerity, cuts off his genitals which are swallowed by a fish. Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Bata lives alone in the wilderness until the gods create a wife for him. Bata loves her very much and reveals to her that his heart is hidden in a pine. Pharaoh, on learning of her existence has her brought to his court. She tells him Bata's secret and he has the pine cut down, killing Bata. Anpu goes to look for his brother, and after finding his body he searches for his heart and finds it after years of searching. Bata is revived and wants to take revenge on his wife. He changes himself into a beautiful bull and his brother takes him to Pharaoh. Bata reveals himself to his wife who has him killed. Two drops of his blood are spilled and from them grow two persea trees, incarnations of Bata. His wife has them felled, but a splinter of their wood enters her mouth, she swallows it and becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, a reincarnation of Bata, who is acknowledged as the Pharaoh's heir. When Pharaoh dies and he becomes king, he has the queen tried and killed.

'''People's Initiative''' (or "'''PI'''") is a common appellative in the [[Philippines]] that refers to either a mode for constitutional amendment provided by the 1987 Philippine Constitution or to the act of pushing an [[initiative]] (national or local) allowed by the Philippine Initiative and Referendum Act of 1987. The appellative also refers to the product of either of those initiatives.

The provision in the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] allowing for a "people's initiative" as one of the modes for [[constitutional amendment]] has been called the "people's initiative clause." The other modes allowed by the Constitution involve a [[Constituent Assembly (Philippines)|Constituent Assembly]] (or "Con-Ass") or a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] (or "Con-Con"), both of which also allow a total revision of the charter.

The appellation (also known as "PI") also refers to the act—allowed by the law-given [[right]] of the [[Filipino people]]—of [[direct democracy|directly]] initiating [[statutes]] or calling for [[referenda]] on both the [[central government|national]] and the [[local government]] level.

== Constitutional amendment initiatives ==
The process of [[Constitutional reform in the Philippines|amending the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] is popularly known to many Filipinos as [[Charter Change]]. Any proposed amendment or revision must be ratified by the majority of Filipinos in a plebiscite.

Article XVII, Section 2 of the Constitution states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered votes therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.

The Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.

An [[enabling act|enabling law]] for this Article XVII, Section 2 Philippine Constitutional provision, called the Initiative and Referendum Act, was authored in 1987 by senators [[Raul Roco]] ([[Aksyon Demokratiko]]) and [[Neptali Gonzales]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]) and was passed by the [[Eighth Congress of the Philippines]] in 1989. The law provides for the implementation of the exercise of the people's right to initiate a [[petition]] to amend the Constitution, with the Election Registrar of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (Comelec) tasked under the law with the verification of the petition signatures' being by at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6735_1989.html|title = AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A SYSTEM OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR|date = |accessdate = 30 September 2014|website = The LAWPHIL Project|publisher = [[Arellano Law Foundation]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute and referendum initiatives==
The People's Initiative can also refer to the right of Filipinos to initiate statutes as well as call for referenda on both the national and local government level, a right given by the Initiative and Referendum Act of 1987, otherwise known as [[Republic Act#Notable Laws|Republic Act 6735]].

===2014 People's Initiative Against Pork Barrel===
From late June to early August 2014, a People's Initiative Against Pork Barrel (PIAP) was repeatedly announced as up for launch in a forthcoming August 23 "people's congress" in [[Cebu City]]. The initiative, a multisectoral [[political alliance|alliance]]-driven proposition to [[criminalize]] [[pork barrel]] fund creation and spending, was led by various groups and individuals including Cebu Archbishop [[Jose S. Palma]], the broad #AbolishPorkMovement, the [[Catholic Church]]-backed Cebu Coalition Against the Pork Barrel System, the Church People's Alliance Against Pork Barrel, ePIRMA (Empowered People's Initiative and Reform Movement Alliance), the [[Makabayan]] Coalition (principally through [[Bayan Muna]] [[party-list]] representative [[Neri Colmenares]]), the Solidarity for Transformation, Youth Act Now, the Scrap Pork Network, and former [[Philippine Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bulatlat.com/main/2014/07/08/peoples-initiative-vs-pork-barrel-political-dynasty-gets-support-of-cbcp/|title = People's Initiative vs pork barrel, political dynasty gets support of CBCP|last = Salamat|first = Marya|date = 8 July 2014|work = Bulatlat.com|accessdate = 12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/368021/news/nation/people-s-initiative-set-vs-pork-barrel-funds|title = People's initiative set vs. pork barrel funds|last = Arcangel|first = Xianne|date = 30 June 2014|work = [[GMA News Online]]|accessdate = 12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/374086/news/nation/cbcp-president-supports-people-s-initiative-vs-pork-barrel|title = CBCP president supports people's initiative vs. pork barrel|last = Locsin|first = Joel|date = 9 August 2014|work = GMA News Online|accessdate = }} Retrieved August 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=39423 Bishops back people's initiative against pork barrel]".

The proposition was one of civil society's resulting reactions to the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]] of 2013 and the [[Million People March]] and other protests that followed. An exploratory "people's congress" to draft an initiative on spending public funds was first convened by the ePIRMA at the [[Asian Institute of Management]] Conference Center on November 9, 2013, with Puno, Colmenares and ePIRMA's legal-team head Jose M. Roy III leading the conference that was attended by representatives from various groups coming from all over the country. ePIRMA and the "people's congress" alliance later scheduled its first draft to be completed by January 2014 while it was awaiting the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]'s decision on prior petitions against both the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund]] (PDAF) and the "presidential pork" disbursements under [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s government's Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.manilatimes.net/broad-alliance-to-hold-peoples-congress-today/51515/|title = Broad alliance to hold People's Congress today|date = November 8, 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = [[The Manila Times]]|publisher = |last =Villamente |first =Jing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.mb.com.ph/e-p-i-r-m-a-peoples-congress/|title = E.P.I.R.M.A. People's Congress|last = Vicoy|first = Ali|date = November 9, 2013|work = [[Manila Bulletin]]|accessdate = August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/11/10/-people-s-move-vs-pork-barrel-needs-p750m-/|title = People's move vs. pork barrel needs P750M|date = 10 November 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = [[Manila Standard Today]]|publisher = |last =Araja |first =Rio N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://1rgcruz.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/peoples-congress/|title = People's Congress|date = 6 November 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = @1RGCruz|publisher = R.G.

Petitions against the PDAF were first filed with the Supreme Court by the [[Social Justice Society]] on August 28, 2013, by [[Greco Belgica]] et al. on September 3, 2013, and by Pedrito Nepomuceno on September 5, 2013. Petitions against the DAP were filed with the Supreme Court by nine separate groups of petitioners between October 7 and November 7, 2013. The petitioners included the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]], Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, [[GABRIELA Women's Party]], Bayan Muna, [[Ang Kapatiran]], and Belgica, among others. On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the PDAF unconstitutional;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/11/19/1258492/sc-declares-pdaf-unconstitutional|title = SC declares PDAF unconstitutional|last = Diola|first = Camille|date = November 19, 2013|work =[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate = August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/microsite/pdaf/|title = Main Decision: Priority Development Assistance Fund|date = November 20, 2013|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = sc.judiciary.gov.ph|publisher = [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|last =Perlas-Bernabe |first =Estela M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision on the DAP came out seven and a half months later, on July 1, 2014, also declaring basic parts of the program as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/63267-understanding-supreme-court-ruling-dap|title = Understanding the SC ruling on the DAP|date = July 14–17, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Rappler.com|publisher =[[Rappler]] |last = Hofileña|first = Chay F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rappler.com/business/features/63691-dap-supreme-court-say|title = DAP: What did the Supreme Court really say?|date = July 18–19, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Rappler.com|publisher =Rappler |last = Geronimo|first = Gerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/microsite/dap/|title = Main Decision: Disbursement Acceleration Program|date = July 2, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Sc.judiciary.gov.ph|publisher = Supreme Court of the Philippines|last =Bersamin |first =Lucas P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the PIAP's proposed Pork Barrel Abolition Act, all budgets submitted to any legislative body shall contain only itemized appropriations, except funds for relief and [[rescue operation]]s during [[calamities]] and funds for [[espionage|intelligence work]] and security. The proposed legislation also called for the abolition of the Presidential Social Fund, which has also been described as a form of pork barrel. Violators of this law were to be banned for life from holding public office.&lt;ref name="Pols"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/668396/pols-obstacles-in-bid-vs-pork-says-bishop|title = Pols obstacles in bid vs pork, says bishop|last = Mayol|first = Ador Vincent|date = January 28, 2015|work = Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date = February 18, 2015|last2 = Matus|first2 = Carmel Loise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2014, the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] ''reported that the Philippine Commission on Elections received the first 10,000 signatures from the initiative thrust in [[Quezon City]]. The signatures were from the city's first six districts, a first installment of the required 177,000 signatures from the entire city territory. Meanwhile, PIAP-[[Metro Manila]] coordinator Mark Lui Aquino said they had yet to submit to the Comelec the 50,000 to 100,000 signatures they had gathered in the metropolis. PIAP-Quezon City spokesperson Malou Turalde said, however, that Quezon City was not the first to submit to the Comelec gathered signatures for the initiative, adding that other legislative districts "just want to be quiet." Aquino also expressed fear that the "Comelec seems unready" and added that, based on his group's monitoring, the Comelec offices in the different cities and municipalities "do not know what to do with the signatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/652823/anti-pork-barrel-group-submits-10000-signatures-from-qc-for-peoples-initiative|title = Anti-pork barrel group submits 10,000 signatures from QC for people's initiative|last = Granali|first = Rima|date = November 25, 2014|work = Inquirer.net|access-date = December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malacañang's resistance to the initiative ====
On September 4, 2014, Rep. Neri Colmenares announced that the ruling Liberal Party was trying to undermine the people's initiative against the pork barrel system. During his interpellation on the same day, at the [[16th Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] budget committee hearing on the 2015 budget for the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], Colmenares noticed that the [[Malacañang Palace]] and its allies in Congress took out the budget that they had placed for a charter change (Cha-Cha) referendum they were planning to launch. Colmenares asked for the budget to be reinserted for the people's initiative plebiscite, but budget committee vice-chair Dakila Cua (Liberal Party, formerly [[Lakas Kampi CMD]]) said that Colmenares's motion should be made during the committee deliberations on the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/09/04/14/palace-undermining-peoples-initiative-lawmaker|title = Palace undermining People's Initiative - lawmaker|last = Cruz|first = R.G.|date = September 4, 2014|work =[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] |accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Liberal Party leaders and spokesmen earlier announced their wish to amend the Constitution to allow President [[Benigno Aquino III]] to run for re-election; as under the present Constitution the President cannot run again for the same office after his single six-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/628668/issue-of-aquino-2nd-term-divides-liberal-party|title = Issue of Aquino 2nd term divides Liberal Party|last = Cabacungan|first = Gil C.|date = August 13, 2014|work =Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, groups against the pork barrel noted that the Aquino government had drafted a national budget for 2015 that still contained "pork" in the form of "special purpose funds," thus ignoring the earlier SC ruling on such funds' unconstitutionality as well as salient points in the PIAP. The groups further noted that this pork budget allocation had ballooned to 27 billion pesos, from the previous year's PHP25 billion pesos.The groups urged Congress to junk the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/646082/congress-urged-to-junk-2015-budget-due-to-pro-dap-provisions|title = Congress urged to junk 2015 budget due to pro-DAP provisions|last = Gamil|first = Jaymee T.|date = October 21, 2014|work = Inquirer.net|accessdate = October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, during the Senate plenary session tackling the said budget, Senator [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]] raised the same points raised by the Makabayan group in the House of Representatives hearings, boosting the Makabayan position on the budget bill amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/26/14/makabayan-finds-ally-miriam-pushes-forward-pi-vs-pork|title = Makabayan finds ally in Miriam, pushes forward with PI vs pork|last = Cruz|first = R.G.|date = November 26, 2014|work = ABS-CBNNews.com|access-date = December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Palma reiterated the importance of the initiative, saying that although the Supreme Court had already declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) as unconstitutional funds, members of Congress continued to enjoy discretionary funds under other forms.&lt;ref name="Pols" /&gt;

==== Attack on anti-pork campaigner ====
On September 29, 2014, minutes after the anti-pork forum in [[Tagum City]], [[Davao del Norte]], which also launched the PIAP in the province, Dexter Ian Selebrado, 32, of the group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas - Davao del Norte (Farmers' Movement of the Philippines - Davao del Norte) and one of the local campaigners against pork barrel funds, was attacked by motorcycle-riding gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/70566-anti-pork-barrel-slay-try|title = Anti-pork activist attacked by gunmen in Davao|last = Manlupig|first = Karlos|date = September 30, 2014|work = Rappler|accessdate = September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 1, the farmer-activist was still in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/10/01/14/pnoy-urged-probe-shooting-anti-pork-leader|title = PNoy urged to probe shooting of anti-pork leader|last = |first = |date = October 1, 2014|work = ABS-CBNews.com|accessdate = October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politicians' resistance to the initiative ====
In his January 2015 [[news conference|conference with the press]], Palma lamented the intervention of [[politicians]] in the turnout of citizens at the signature centers in his [[parishes]]. Apart from a lack of knowledge about the pork barrel, Palma claimed that a low turnout was also a result of there being families who had children enrolled in schools under politicians' pork-funded [[scholarships]] whose relatives then refused to sign the proposition. Turnout results in other [[dioceses]] were also not good, he said. He promised, however, that the Church would not be disheartened and cited the strong support of people in such dioceses as [[Calbayog City]].&lt;ref name="Pols" /&gt;

==== The initiative and the pork barrel issue by 2016 ====
In his blog of July 4, 2016, direct democracy advocate Jojo Soria de Veyra, a member of ePIRMA, confessed that after the initiative's launch "the signature gathering was mostly left to certain parishes of the more organized Catholic Church, the primary backing of the Cebu Coalition. Sporadic rallies of support were organized by the Makabayan group and provincial groups. Other members of ePIRMA were seen to have moved on to various other national concerns. [[Manny SD Lopez]]—ePIRMA's leading convenor and most active campaigner on the road—would also busy himself with organizing the Christian Peace Alliance, one of the groups advocating for a drastic review of some provisions of the then-in-its-final-thrust [[Bangsamoro Basic Law]]. Lopez would also form the EdlSA 2.22.15 Coalition, a group that called for President Benigno Aquino III's resignation after the [[Mamasapano clash|Mamasapano mishap]]. I submit that in this latter period I was not privy anymore to how the signature-gathering for the initiative on the pork barrel was progressing. I did hear of some pockets of resistance to the initiative, as well as the Comelec's seeming lack of enthusiasm towards verifying the signatures, but that's about it. . . . Then came the various noises leading to the [[Philippine general election, 2016|2016 general election]], within which news concerning the initiative's progress were nowhere anymore to be found on Google." De Veyra, also a convenor of a Facebook group called Forum for Direct Democracy, then proceeded in his blog to propose amendments to the Initiative and Referendum Act that would make the law easier for the people to use as well as obligate Comelec to do its part in the initiative process within a limited time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jojosoriadeveyra.blogspot.com/2016/07/my-amendment-proposals-to-initiative.html|title=Social / -Isms: My amendment proposals re the Initiative and Referendum Act (RA 6735)|last=Veyra|first=Jojo Soria De|date=2016-07-04|website=Social / -Isms|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on August 31, Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]] told the media that "the ₱3.35-trillion proposed budget presented by Malacañang [under the newly-elected [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]]] to the Senate for congressional approval is laden with 'pork' and violated the Supreme Court rulings on the Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/214832/lacson-2017-budget-laden-with-pork-barrel.html|title=Lacson: 2017 budget laden with pork barrel|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">In [[mathematical logic]], '''positive set theory''' is the name for a class of alternative [[set theory|set theories]] in which the [[axiom of comprehension]]

*"&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; exists"

holds for at least the '''positive formulas''' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (the smallest class of formulas containing atomic membership and equality formulas and closed under conjunction, disjunction, existential and universal quantification).

Typically, the motivation for these theories is topological:  the sets are the classes which are closed under a certain [[topology]].  The closure conditions for the various constructions allowed in building positive formulas are readily motivated (and one can further justify the use of universal quantifiers bounded in sets to get '''generalized positive comprehension'''):  the justification of the existential quantifier seems to require that the topology be [[compact spaces|compact]].

The set theory &lt;math&gt;GPK^+_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of Olivier Esser consists of the following axioms:

* The [[axiom of extensionality]]: &lt;math&gt;x=y \Leftrightarrow\forall a\, (a\in x \Leftrightarrow a\in y)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[axiom of empty set]]: there exists a set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\,\neg \exists x\; x\in\emptyset\,&lt;/math&gt; (this axiom can be neatly dispensed with if a false formula &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; is included as a positive formula).
* The axiom of generalized positive [[axiom of comprehension|comprehension]]: if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in predicate logic using only &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also a set. Quantification (&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;) may be bounded.
** Note that negation is specifically not permitted.
* The axiom of [[topological closure|closure]]: for every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, a set exists which is the intersection of all sets which contain every ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;; this is called the '''closure of &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and is written in any of the various ways that topological closures can be presented.  This can be put more briefly if class language is allowed (any condition on sets defining a class as in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]):  for any class ''C'' there is a set which is the intersection of all sets which contain ''C'' as a subclass.  This is obviously a reasonable principle if the sets are understood as closed classes in a topology.
* The [[axiom of infinity]]: the [[von Neumann]] [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; exists.  This is not an axiom of infinity in the usual sense; if Infinity does not hold, the closure of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; exists  and has itself as its sole additional member (it is certainly infinite); the point of this axiom is that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; contains no additional elements at all, which boosts the theory from the strength of second order arithmetic to the strength of [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with the proper class ordinal a [[weakly compact cardinal]].

== Interesting properties ==

* The [[universal set]] is a proper set in this theory.
* The sets of this theory are the collections of sets which are closed under a certain [[topology]] on the classes.
* The theory can interpret [[ZFC]] (by restricting oneself to the class of well-founded sets, which is not itself a set).  It in fact interprets a stronger theory ([[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with the proper class ordinal a [[weakly compact cardinal]]).

A '''Propulsive Fluid Accumulator''' is an artificial Earth [[satellite]] which collects and stores oxygen and other [[atmospheric gases]] for in-situ refuelling of high-thrust rockets. This eliminates the need to lift oxidizer to orbit and therefore brings significant cost benefits.  A major portion of the total world payload sent into low earth orbit each year is either liquid oxygen or water.

== Propulsive Fluid Accumulator (PROFAC)==
In the period 1956 to 1963, S.T. Demetriades proposed methods of atmospheric gas accumulation by means of a satellite moving in [[low Earth orbit]], at an altitude of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, or propellant accumulation by stations on the surface of a planet or by gathering and exploiting interstellar matter &lt;ref&gt;JBIS, Vol 17, p114, 1959 - 1960; ARS Preprint 2438-62, Part I, 14-16 Mar 1962; Parts II, III and IV not to be found in the open literature; also National Archives ARC Identifier No. 1250057 and 1250058&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;1963 McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=November 2011}}. In its simplest form, Demetriades' proposed satellite extracts air from the fringes of the atmosphere, compresses and cools it, and extracts liquid oxygen. The remaining nitrogen is, in part, used as propellant for a  nuclear-powered [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] electromagnetic plasma thruster, which maintains the orbit at about 120&amp;nbsp;km, or a solar powered thruster (and collection system) for altitudes above 150&amp;nbsp;km (as stated in the original 1959 JBIS article, p119) compensating for atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Demetriades1962epc&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Demetriades|first=S.T.|title=The Use of Atmospheric and Extraterrestrial Resources in Space Propulsion Systems, Part I|journal=Electric Propulsion Conference, American Rocket Society|date=March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was called “PROFAC” (PROpulsive Fluid ACcumulator).&lt;ref name=Demetriades1962jbis&gt;. Several systems were studied, e. g. PROFAC-S for Surface, PROFAC-C for Orbital, PROFAC-A for combination with aerospaceplane making one reusable stage to orbit possible, etc. Several inlets (e. g. conical as in AIEE 10 Aug 1960 San Diego meeting, or funnel) and cryopumps were studied for orbital air collection. The work slowed down in late 1961 although much progress was made in later years on such items as a solar-powered PROFAC.

There are, however, safety concerns with placing a nuclear reactor in low Earth orbit.

== Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit (PHARO) ==
Demetriades' proposal was further refined by Christopher Jones and others in 2010. In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate propellant gases at around 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of [[Space-based solar power|orbital power-beaming satellites]], to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;
Jones, C.,  Masse, D.,  Glass, C.,  Wilhite, A., and  Walker, M. (2010), "PHARO: Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit," IEEE Aerospace Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harvesting at about 200 kilometers altitude (LOX-LEO) ==
Klinkman and Wilkes proposed, at the AIAA Space 2007 and Space 2009 conferences, that gases could be harvested at the very edge of the earth's atmosphere by a high vacuum pump. An ion propulsion engine would consume a portion of the harvested gases and would restore the spacecraft's orbital momentum.  Klinkman's proposal has a fairly low energy threshold for a small-scale harvesting operation, and air friction is far more forgiving at 200&amp;nbsp;km than at 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Klinkman2009&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that S. T. Demetriades pioneered in space propulsion, from the atomic oxygen ramjet (he proved it not feasible in the 1950s) to nuclear, ion, and plasma thrusters.  He received the 2010 AIAA Award for Plasmadynamics and Lasers.

Boeing has suggested a non-extractive [[propellant depot]], or "space gas station," which accumulates material launched from the planet at low cost, allowing future lunar missions without the need for large launch vehicles like the [[Saturn V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/news/4224660?page=1 Popular Mechanics: Space Gas Station Would Blast Huge Payloads to the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt; MIT has recently proposed a similar plan which would store emergency fuel reserves left over from lunar missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/mit-envisions-orbital-fueling-stations-for-future-moon-missions&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recycling symbol.svg|thumb|160px|The three chasing arrows of the international recycling logo]]

'''Recycling''' is the process of converting [[waste]] materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from [[incineration]]), and water pollution (from [[landfill|landfilling]]).

Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "[[Waste minimisation|Reduce]], [[Reuse]], and Recycle" [[waste hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig, H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pages=193–218|chapter=Recycling Requirements and Design for Environmental Compliance|publisher=Springer|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECWaste&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=2014 |title=EU Waste Legislation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312223737/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting waste outputs out of the economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geissdoerfer|first=Martin|last2=Savaget|first2=Paulo|last3=Bocken|first3=Nancy M.P.|last4=Hultink|first4=Erik Jan|date=2017|title=The Circular Economy – A new sustainability paradigm?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652616321023|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=143|pages=757–768|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048|issn=0959-6526|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and [[ISO 14001]]:2015 for environmental management control of recycling practice.

''Recyclable materials'' include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, [[tire]]s, textiles, and [[electronics]]. The [[composting]] or other reuse of [[biodegradable waste]]—such as [[food waste|food]] or [[Green waste|garden waste]]—is also considered recycling.&lt;ref name="gar"&gt;{{cite book |last = The League of Women Voters |title = The Garbage Primer |publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford |year = 1993 |location = New York |pages = 35–72 |isbn = 978-1-55821-250-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.

In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used [[polystyrene]] foam into new polystyrene. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so "recycling" of many products or materials involves their ''[[reuse]]'' in producing different materials (for example, [[paperboard]]) instead. Another form of recycling is the [[Waste sorting|salvage]] of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from [[car batteries]], or gold from [[circuit board]]s), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[thermometer]]s and [[thermostat]]s).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Recycling has been a common practice for most of human history, with recorded advocates as far back as [[Plato]] in the fourth century BC during the Byzantine era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affairs.com/greenfiles/Revered/byzantine-empire-for-recycling/ |title = Byzantine Empire (for recycling)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During periods when resources were scarce and hard to come by, archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery)—implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Black Dog Publishing |publisher = Black Dog Publishing |year = 2006 |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-1-904772-36-1 |title = Recycle : a source book }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pre-industrial]] times, there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for perpetual reuse.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Handbook of Energy: Chronologies, Top Ten Lists, and Word Clouds |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ScL77rOCZn0C&amp;dq=1031+japan+paper+recycling |publisher = Elsevier |date = 15 November 2013 |isbn = 978-0-12-417019-3 |first = Cutler J. |last = Cleveland |first2 = Christopher G. |last2 = Morris |page = 461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Sustaining the earth: choosing consumer products that are safe for you, your family, and the earth |url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/sustaining-the-earth-choosing-consumer-products-that-are-safe-for-you-your-family-and-the-earth/oclc/29702410 |publisher = Hearst Books |date = 1 January 1994 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-688-12335-2 |first = Debra |last = Dadd-Redalia |page = 103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by "[[Waste collector|dustmen]]" and [[downcycling|downcycled]] as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material, as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; In 1813, [[Benjamin Law (inventor)|Benjamin Law]] developed the process of turning rags into "[[shoddy]]" and "[[Glossary of textile manufacturing#M|mungo]]" wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin [[wool]]. The [[West Yorkshire]] shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.

Industrialization spurred demand for affordable materials; aside from rags, ferrous [[scrap]] metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By [[World War I]], thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle post-consumer materials back into industrial production.&lt;ref name="cash"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Carl A. Zimring |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2005 |location = New Brunswick, NJ |isbn = 978-0-8135-4694-0 |title = Cash for Your Trash: Scrap Recycling in America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverage bottles were recycled with a refundable deposit at some drink manufacturers in Great Britain and Ireland around 1800, notably [[Schweppes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |title = sd_shire |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = 27 October 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014013216/http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |archivedate = 14 October 2012 |df = dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official recycling system with refundable [[Container deposit legislation|deposits]] was established in Sweden for bottles in 1884 and aluminum beverage cans in 1982; the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of 84–99 percent depending on type, and a glass bottle can be refilled over 20 times on average.

New chemical industries created in the late 19th century both invented new materials (e.g. [[Bakelite]] [1907]) and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials.  Proverbially, you could not [[wikt:make a silk purse of a sow's ear|make a silk purse of a sow's ear]]—until the US firm Arhur D. Little published in 1921 "On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows' Ears", its research proving that when "chemistry puts on overalls and gets down to business ... new values appear. New and better paths are opened to reach the goals desired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/purse/ |title = Report: "On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows' Ears," 1921: Exhibits: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT |author =  |date =  |website = mit.edu |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycling (or "salvage", as it was then usually known) was a major issue for governments throughout [[World War II]]. Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |last = Public Broadcasting System (2007) |title = The War Episode 2: Rationing and Recycling |url = https://www.pbs.org/ |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These resource shortages caused by the [[world war]]s, and other such world-changing occurrences, greatly encouraged recycling.&lt;ref&gt;''Out of the Garbage-Pail into the Fire: fuel bricks now added to the list of things salvaged by science from the nation's waste'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, page 50-51, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&lt;/ref&gt; The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available, leaving little for the civilian population.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; Massive government promotion campaigns, such as the [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|National Salvage Campaign]] in Britain and the [[Salvage for Victory]] campaign in the United States, were carried out on the [[home front during World War II|home front]] in every combative nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a matter of patriotism.

=== Post-World War II ===

A considerable investment in recycling occurred in the 1970s, due to rising energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.plasticexpert.co.uk/recycling-ages-1970s/ |title = Recycling through the ages: 1970s |date = 30 July 2014 |accessdate = 7 March 2015 |website = Plastic Expert |publisher = Plastic Expert }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling aluminum uses only 5% of the energy required by virgin production; glass, paper and other metals have less dramatic but very significant energy savings when recycled feedstock is used.&lt;ref name="economistrecycle" /&gt;

Although consumer electronics such as the television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CRC History – Computer Recycling Center |url = http://www.crc.org/about/crc_history.php |website = www.crc.org |accessdate = 29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About us – Swico Recycling |url = http://www.swicorecycling.ch/en/about-us/ |website = www.swicorecycling.ch |accessdate = 29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China.

As of 2014, the [[European Union]] had about 50% of world share of the waste and recycling industries, with over {{formatnum:60000}} companies employing {{formatnum:500000}} persons, with a turnover of €24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm Recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203063401/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm |date=3 February 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries have to reach recycling rates of at least 50%, while the lead countries were around 65% and the EU average was 39% as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/what/public-events/competitions/waste-smart-competition/recycling-rates-in-europe/view Recycling rates in Europe], [[European Environment Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, changes in the recycling market have sparked a global "crisis" in the industry. On December 31, 2017, China announced its "National Sword" policy, setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials that were deemed too "dirty" or "hazardous". The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global market in recycling and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low-grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G7 countries to China dropped dramatically, with many exports shifting to countries in southeast Asia. The crisis generated significant concern about the practices and environmental sustainability of the recycling industry. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more recyclable materials than they could process, raising fundamental questions about shipping recycling waste from economically developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations—a practice that predated the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title = Why the world's recycling system stopped working |url = https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |journal = [[Financial Times]] |accessdate = 25 October 2018 |last1 = Hook |first1 = Leslie |last2 = Reed |first2 = John |date = 24 October 2018 |url-access=limited |archive-url=http://archive.today/2018.10.25-073925/https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |archive-date=25 October 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== Supply ===

For a recycling program to work, having a large, stable [[supply and demand|supply]] of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, [[container deposit legislation]], and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Container deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Beverage Container Deposit Law for Hawaii |url = http://www.opala.org/solid_waste/Container_Deposit_Summary_Oct2002.html |website = www.opala.org |accessdate = 31 July 2015 |date = Oct 2002 |publisher = City &amp; County of Honolulu, Department of Environmental Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt; A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = European Council |url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/final_rep_okopol.pdf |title = The Producer Responsibility Principle of the WEEE Directive |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way to increase supply of recyclates is to [[ban (law)|ban]] the disposal of certain materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. One aim of this method is to create a viable economy for proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that enough of these recycling [[service (economics)|services]] exist, or such bans simply lead to increased [[fly-tipping|illegal dumping]].&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

=== Government-mandated demand ===

Legislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of such legislation exist: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates, [[procurement]] policies, and recycled [[Mandatory labeling|product labeling]].&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeLong"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |title = Regulatory Policy Center&amp;nbsp;— Property Matters&amp;nbsp;— James V. DeLong |accessdate = 28 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414205905/http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |archivedate = 14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governments]] have used their own [[purchasing power]] to increase recycling demand through what are called "procurement policies". These policies are either "set-asides", which reserve a certain amount of spending solely towards recycled products, or "price preference" programs which provide a larger [[government budget|budget]] when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

The final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient [[buying power]] can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

'''Recyclate''' is a raw material that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which will be used to form new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Web-Dictionary.com (2013) |title = Recyclate |url = http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070530/http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |archivedate = 7 April 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re-manufacturing so that it can be used in the production of new materials or products. For example, [[plastic bottle]]s that are collected can be re-used and made into plastic pellets, a new product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Freudenrich, C. (2014) |title = How Plastics Work |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/plastic5.htm |accessdate = 7 July 2016 |date = 2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of recyclate ===

The quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web |last = DEFRA (2013) |title = Quality Action Plan Proposals to Promote High Quality Recycling of Dry Recyclates |url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221028/pb13875-qap-recycling.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve "high-quality" recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process.

The quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing and keeping products out of landfills.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; High-quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments, households, and businesses.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector.

There are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate.&lt;ref name=Scottish&gt;{{cite web |last = The Scottish Government (2012) |title = Recylate Quality Action Plan – Consultation Paper |url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/6584/6 |date = 2012-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; The storage of materials outside, where the product can become wet, can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.

=== Quality recyclate action plan (Scotland) ===

The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that the [[Scottish Government]] would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt;

The plan's objectives are to:&lt;ref name=highland&gt;{{cite web |last = The Highland Council (2013) |title = Report by Director of Transport, Environmental and Community Services |url = http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064459/http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |archivedate = 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drive up the quality of recyclate.
* Deliver greater transparency about the quality of recyclate.
* Provide help to those contracting with materials recycling facilities to identify what is required of them
* Ensure compliance with the Waste (Scotland) regulations 2012.
* Stimulate a household market for quality recyclate.
* Address and reduce issues surrounding the Waste Shipment Regulations.

The plan focuses on three key areas, with fourteen actions which were identified to increase the quality of materials collected, sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland.&lt;ref name=highland /&gt;

The three areas of focus are:&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt;

# Collection systems and input contamination
# Sorting facilities – material sampling and transparency
# Material quality benchmarking and standards

== Recycling consumer waste ==

=== Collection ===

[[File:DeutscheBahnRecycling20050814 CopyrightKaihsuTai Rotated.jpg|thumb|upright|A three-sided bin at a railway station in [[Germany]], intended to separate paper ''(left)'' and plastic wrappings ''(right)'' from other waste ''(back)'']]

A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are "drop-off centers", "buy-back centers", and "curbside collection".&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

==== Curbside collection ====
{{Main|Curbside collection}}
[[File:ACT recycling truck.jpg|thumb|A recycling truck collecting the contents of a [[recycling bin]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].]]

Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt; A [[waste collection vehicle]] generally picks up the waste.

At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt;

In a commingled or [[Single-stream recycling|single-stream system]], all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require [[public education]] on what materials are recyclable.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economisttruth"/&gt;

=====Source separation=====
Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional [[operating cost]]s for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate [[contamination]] is to be avoided.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt;

Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what's called ''co-mingled collection''.&lt;ref name="economisttruth"/&gt;

==== Buy-back centers ====

Buy-back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the emission of greenhouse gasses. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S. [[National Waste &amp; Recycling Association]], it costs on average $50 to process a ton of material, which can be resold for $30.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

In the US, the value per ton of mixed recyclables was $180 in 2011, $80 in 2015, and $100 in 2017.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news |first = Paul |last = Singer |title = Recycling market in a heap of trouble |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/20/weak-markets-make-consumers-wishful-recycling-big-problem/100654976/ |newspaper = USA Today |location = Melbourne, Florida |pages = 1B, 2B |date = 21 April 2017 |accessdate = 21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, glass is essentially valueless, because of the low cost of sand, its major component; low oil costs thwarts plastic recycling.&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

In 2017, [[Napa, California]], was reimbursed about 20% of its costs in recycling.&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

==== Drop-off centers ====

Drop-off centers require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.

==== Distributed recycling ====

For some waste materials such as plastic, recent technical devices called [[recyclebots]]&lt;ref name="RPJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Baechler |first1 = Christian |last2 = DeVuono |first2 = Matthew |last3 = Pearce |first3 = Joshua M. |year = 2013 |title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock |url = https://www.academia.edu/2643418 |journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal |volume = 19 |issue = 2 |pages = 118–125 |doi = 10.1108/13552541311302978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enable a form of distributed recycling. Preliminary [[life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of [[HDPE]] to make filament of [[3D printers]] in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.&lt;ref name="LCA"&gt;M.

=== Sorting ===

[[File:Recycling Video.webm|thumb|Video of recycling facility and processes.|thumb|Recycling sorting facility and processes]]

Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a [[Materials recovery facility|central collection facility]], the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as [[single-stream recycling]]. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different [[types of plastics]], glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = Common Recyclable Materials |url = http://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise/pubs/commonmats.pdf |publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate = 2 February 2013 |date = 2015-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.&lt;ref&gt;ScienceDaily. (2007). [https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm Recycling Without Sorting Engineers Create Recycling Plant That Removes The Need To Sort] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831095259/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm |date=31 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of [[corrugated fiberboard]] and [[plastic bag]]s are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

[[File:Glass and plastic recycling 065 ubt.JPG|thumb|left|Early sorting of recyclable materials: glass and plastic bottles in [[Poland]]]]

Next, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] (#1) and [[HDPE]] (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers: a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

Strong magnets are used to separate out [[ferrous metal]]s, such as iron, steel, and [[tin can]]s. [[Non-ferrous metal]]s are ejected by magnetic [[eddy current]]s in which a rotating [[magnetic field]] [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic [[eddy current]] is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

[[File:Recycling Point - geograph.org.uk - 1382457.jpg|thumb|A recycling point in [[New Byth]], Scotland, with separate containers for paper, plastics, and differently colored glass]]

Finally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may either be sorted by hand,&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; or via an automated machine that uses colored filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than {{convert|10|mm|in}} across cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as "glass fines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = What Happens to My Recycling? |url = http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |publisher = www.1coast.com.au |accessdate = 21 July 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811010701/http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |archivedate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/downloads/benefits.pdf |title = Puzzled About Recycling's Value?

[[Food packaging]] should no longer contain any organic matter (organic matter, if any, needs to be placed in a [[biodegradable waste]] bin or be buried in a garden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Trench Composting Your Kitchen Waste |url = http://www.growveg.com/growblogpost.aspx?id=318 |website = www.growveg.com |accessdate = 31 July 2015 |last = Pleasant |first = Barbara |date = 26 September 2013 |publisher = Growing Interactive Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Since no trace of biodegradable material is best kept in the packaging before placing it in a [[trash bag]], some packaging also needs to be rinsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ecomythsalliance.org/2013/10/myth-you-must-rinse-all-containers-before-recycling-them/ |title = Rinsing food packaging |author = Daisy Simmons |website = EcoMyths |date = 2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recycling industrial waste ==

[[File:Shredded tires.JPG|right|thumb|Mounds of shredded rubber tires are ready for processing]]

Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/elibrary/Content/Internet/538/755/1929/421459230.pdf|title = UK statistics on waste – 2010 to 2012 |date = 25 September 2014 |accessdate = 3 December 2017 |website = UK Government |publisher = UK Government |page = 2 and 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost–effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like [[retail store]]s, [[warehouse]]s, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.

The glass, lumber, [[wood pulp]] and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials; however, old [[rubber tires]] may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.

Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society&lt;ref name="IRP"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |title = Publications – International Resource Panel |author =  |date =  |website = unep.org |accessdate = 7 July 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121111132915/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |archivedate = 11 November 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their recycling rates.&lt;ref name="IRP" /&gt; The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example, the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238&amp;nbsp;kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.

The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground (the term "'''urban mining'''" has been coined with this idea in mind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = How Urban Mining Works |url = http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100711042131/http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 11 July 2010 |accessdate = 9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

The military recycles some metals. The [[U.S. Navy]]'s Ship Disposal Program uses [[ship breaking]] to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an [[artificial reef]]. [[Uranium]] is a very dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and [[titanium]] for many military and industrial uses. The [[uranium]] left over from processing it into [[nuclear weapon]]s and fuel for [[nuclear reactor]]s is called [[depleted uranium]], and it is used by all branches of the U.S. military use for armour-piercing shells and shielding.

The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.

Some industries, like the [[renewable energy industry]] and [[solar photovoltaic]] technology, in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating future demand during their rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N. C. | last1=McDonald | first2=J.

Recycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of [[PVC]] often results in [[downcycling]] of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the [[Vinyloop]] process. It was used after the [[London Olympics 2012]] to fulfill the PVC Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = London 2012 seeks sustainable solutions for temporary venues |url = http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |publisher = ODA |accessdate = 20 August 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120827113019/http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |archivedate = 27 August 2012 |df = dmy-all |date = 2017-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-waste recycling ===
{{Main|Computer recycling}}

[[File:RetiredCPUs.jpg|thumb|Computer processors retrieved from waste stream]]

[[Electronic waste|E-waste]] is a growing problem, accounting for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU.&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt; Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|Khian Sea]] dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in [[Haiti]], the [[Basel Convention]] was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the [[e-Stewards]] certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] of the EU the [[United States]] National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.

In the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly {{convert|10|cm|in}} in size, and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and [[capacitor]]s which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to {{convert|10|mm|in}} particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An [[eddy current]] ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the mercury backlight from LCDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |format = PDF |first = Thomas Q. |last = Hogye |title = The Anatomy of a Computer Recycling Process |publisher = California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery |accessdate = 13 October 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200011/http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |archivedate = 23 September 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Resources – BBC Documentary |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/resources/bbc.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |accessdate = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Glass Recycling – BBC filming of CRT furnace |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/glassrecycling/furness.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |accessdate = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastic recycling ===
{{Main|Plastic recycling}}

[[File:Spoon recycling 3d printing.jpg|thumb|upright|A container for recycling used plastic spoons into material for 3D printing]]

Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/eco-plastic1.htm |title = "Eco"-plastic: recycled plastic |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 22 April 2009 |accessdate = 9 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical recycling ====

Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt.

==== Chemical recycling ====

For some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again.

==== Waste plastic pyrolysis to fuel oil ====

Another process involves conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal [[depolymerization]] process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including [[thermoset]] materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the [[biopolymer]]s in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = RESEM A Leading Pyrolysis Plant Manufacturer |url = http://www.pyrolysisoil.net |publisher = RESEM Pyrolysis Plant |accessdate = 20 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plant of this type in [[Carthage, Missouri]], USA, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.
Plastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for [[pyrolysis]]:
* Mixed plastic ([[HDPE]], [[LDPE]], [[polyethylene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[Nylon]], [[Teflon]], [[polystyrene|PS]], [[ABS plastic|ABS]], [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]], etc.)
* Mixed waste plastic from waste paper mill
* Multi-layered plastic

== Recycling loops ==

[[File:RecyclingLoops.png|thumb|Loops for production-waste, product and material recycling]]

The (ideal) recycling process can be differentiated into three loops, one for manufacture (production-waste recycling) and two for disposal of the product (product and material recycling).&lt;ref name="recyclingBook"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=197–199|chapter= Manufacture, Use and Disposal of Electronic Systems in the Circular Economy|publisher=Springer|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product's manufacturing phase, which consists of material processing and fabrication, forms the ''production-waste recycling'' loop. Industrial waste materials are fed back into, and reused in, the same production process.

The product's disposal process requires two recycling loops: ''product recycling'' and ''material recycling''.&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt;
The product or product parts are reused in the ''product recycling'' phase. This happens in one of two ways: the product is used retaining the product functionality ("reuse") or the product continues to be used but with altered functionality ("further use").&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt; The product design is unmodified, or only slightly modified, in both scenarios.

Product disassembly requires ''material recycling'' where product materials are recovered and recycled. Ideally, the materials are processed so they can  flow back into the production process.&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt;

== Recycling codes ==
{{Main|Recycling codes}}

[[File:Recycling codes on products.jpg|thumb|Recycling codes on products]]

In order to meet recyclers' needs while providing manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a [[Recycling codes|coding system]] was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the [[Society of the Plastics Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF Plastic Recycling codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |date=21 July 2011 }}, American Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt; Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the [[resin identification code|resin coding system]] offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&amp;did=4644 About resin identification codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019171528/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&amp;did=4644 |date=19 October 2010 }} American Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic products are printed with numbers 1–7 depending on the type of resin. Type 1 ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, [[hula hoops]], [[credit cards]], wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is [[polypropylene]] and makes up syrup bottles, straws, [[Tupperware]], and some automotive parts. Type 6 is [[polystyrene]] and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Recycling Symbols on Plastics&amp;nbsp;– What Do Recycling Codes on Plastics Mean |url = http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/latest/recycling-symbols-plastics-460321?src=soc_fcbk |publisher = The Daily Green |accessdate = 29 February 2012 |date = 2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.

== Economic impact ==

Critics{{who|date=December 2017}} dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from [[confirmation bias]]. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1 = Lynn R. Kahle |editor2 = Eda Gurel-Atay |title = Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy |year = 2014 |location = New York |publisher = M.E. Sharpe |isbn = 978-0-7656-3680-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Waste and Recycling Association]] (NWRA), reported in May 2015, that recycling and waste made a $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio, U.S., and employed 14,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |title = Recycling and waste have $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio |author = RecyclingToday |date = 14 May 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100058/http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |archivedate = 18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate over whether recycling is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]]. According to a [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6–13 or more jobs per 1,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/green-jobs-ca-recycling-report.pdf |title=From Waste to Jobs: What Achieving 75 Percent Recycling Means for California |last=|first= |date=March 2014|website=|page=2|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the cost effectiveness of creating the additional jobs remains unproven. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = No Author |first = No Author |title = Recycling Benefits to the Economy |url = http://www.all-recycling-facts.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = www.all-recycling-facts.com |accessdate = 1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be "a drain on the city", New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Recycling Revolution |url = http://www.recycling-revolution.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = www.recycling-revolution.com |accessdate = 1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities often see [[finance|fiscal]] benefits from implementing recycling programs, largely due to the reduced [[landfill]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lavee D. (2007). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r461lju585760316/ "Is Municipal Solid Waste Recycling Economically Efficient?"] ''Environmental Management''.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Technical University of Denmark]] according to the Economist found that in 83 percent of cases, recycling is the most efficient method to dispose of household waste.&lt;ref name="economisttruth"&gt;{{cite news |title = The truth about recycling |date = 7 June 2007 |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9249262 |work = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economistrecycle"&gt;{{cite news |title = The price of virtue |date = 7 June 2007 |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9302727 |work = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2004 assessment by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute concluded that incineration was the most effective method for disposing of drink containers, even aluminium ones.&lt;ref name=Vigso2004&gt;{{cite journal |last = Vigso |first = Dorte |year = 2004 |title = Deposits on single use containers&amp;nbsp;— a social cost–benefit analysis of the Danish deposit system for single use drink containers |journal = Waste Management &amp; Research |volume = 22 |issue = 6 |pages = 477–87 |doi = 10.1177/0734242X04049252 |url = http://wmr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/22/6/477 |pmid = 15666450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call [[externality|externalities]], which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced [[hazardous waste]] leaching from landfills, reduced [[energy (society)|energy]] consumption, and reduced waste and [[resource consumption]], which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of which only a few hundred are relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://faculty.uml.edu/Nelson_Eby/89.215/Assignments/Mineral%20Identification.pdf Minerals and Forensic Science]" (PDF).

''[[Reason Magazine]]''. 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's [[carbon emissions]] by a net 49 million [[metric tonnes]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[Waste and Resources Action Programme]] stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce [[Greenhouse gas|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] by 10–15 million tonnes a year.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are [[economies of scale]] involved.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

[[File:PILE OF WRECKED AUTOS AT KLEAN STEEL CO - NARA - 542660.jpg|thumb|upright|Wrecked automobiles gathered for smelting]]

Certain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the [[waste stream]], a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked—without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only "collection".&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Free-market economist [[Julian Simon]] remarked "There are three ways society can organize waste disposal: (a) commanding, (b) guiding by tax and subsidy, and (c) leaving it to the individual and the market". These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Household and Municipal Recycling? |url = http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ejwjournl/v_3a4_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-111.htm |journal = Econ Journal Watch |date = 1 January 2007 |pages = 83–111 |volume = 4 |issue = 1 |first = Matthew |last = Gunter |archive-url = http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/6eyfmh |archive-date = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Ackerman]] favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling's benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional ''laissez-faire'' economics. [[Allen Hershkowitz]] supports intervention, saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of fly-tipping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers, companies and councils to recycle more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most free-market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention because they waste resources. [[Terry L. Anderson|Terry Anderson]] and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. [[Daniel Benjamin|Daniel K. Benjamin]] argues that it wastes people's resources and lowers the wealth of a population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Trade in recyclates ===
Certain countries trade in unprocessed [[wikt:recyclate|recyclates]]. Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50–80 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm |title = Much toxic computer waste lands in Third World |website = USA Today |date = 25 February 2002 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031109231707/http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archivedate = 9 November 2003 |title = Environmental and health damage in China |publisher = svtc.igc.org |date = 9 November 2003 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers' health or environmental damage.

Certain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the [[American Midwest]] there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

Similarly, the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper, given the large number of [[pulp mill]]s in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S., however, demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

In some U.S. states, a program called [[RecycleBank]] pays people to recycle, receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space which must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie DeSimone (February 21, 2006).

== Criticisms and responses ==
{{anchor|Criticism}}

Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of [[sustainable design]] aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' by architect [[William McDonough]] and chemist [[Michael Braungart]]. They suggest that every product (and all packaging it requires) should have a complete "closed-loop" cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through [[biodegradation]] or be recycled indefinitely.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites, current recycling misses the dissipative components. Complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive. "For example, how will it ever be possible to recycle the numerous chlorinated organic hydrocarbons that have bioaccumulated in animal and human tissues across the globe, the copper dispersed in fungicides, the lead in widely applied paints, or the zinc oxides present in the finely dispersed rubber powder that is abraded from automobile tires?"&lt;ref name="limits of science"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Huesemann |first1 = M.&amp;nbsp;H. |year = 2003 |title = Recognizing the limits of environmental science and technology |journal = Environ.

As with [[environmental economics]], care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, [[paperboard]] packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite news |first = John |last = Tierney |title = Recycling Is Garbage |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&amp;pagewanted=all |work = The New York Times |page = 3 |date = 30 June 1996 |accessdate = 28 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206160552/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |archivedate = 6 December 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy and material flows ===
{{anchor|Saves energy}}
[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Bales of crushed steel ready for transport to the smelter]]

The amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with [[life-cycle analysis]] using real energy values, and in addition, [[exergy]], which is a measure of useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. (2005). "Comparative LCAs for curbside recycling versus either landfilling or incineration with energy recovery" (12 pp). ''The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment'', 10(4), 273–284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oskamp | first1 = S | year = 1995 | title = Resource conservation and recycling: Behavior and policy | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 157–177 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pimenteira, C.A.P., Pereira, A.S.; Oliveira, L.B.; Rosa, L.P.; Reis, M.M.; Henriques, R.M.

Some scholars use [[emergy]] (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, budgets for the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics-based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by [[adaptive reuse]] systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.&lt;ref name="Brown03" /&gt;

The [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) states on its website that "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber."&lt;ref&gt;Energy Information Administration [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html#SavingEnergy "Recycling Paper &amp; Glass"]. Retrieved 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.&lt;ref name="Brown03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Brown |first1 = M.

It is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms, where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. For example, "cities do not follow all the strategies of ecosystem development. Biogeochemical paths become fairly straight relative to wild ecosystems, with very reduced recycling, resulting in large flows of waste and low total energy efficiencies. By contrast, in wild ecosystems, one population's wastes are another population's resources, and succession results in efficient exploitation of available resources. However, even modernized cities may still be in the earliest stages of a succession that may take centuries or millennia to complete."&lt;ref name="Decker00"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Energy and Material flow through the urban Ecosystem |first1 = Ethan H. |last1 = Decker |first2 = Scott |last2 = Elliott |first3 = Felisa A. |last3 = Smith |first4 = Donald R. |last4 = Blake |first5 = F.

=== Costs ===
The amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as [[gate fee|landfill fees]] and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by "redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks".&lt;ref&gt;Waste to Wealth [http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/wrrs/fivemyths.html The Five Most Dangerous Myths About Recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529062928/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/wrrs/fivemyths.html |date=29 May 2009 }}.

Comparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic [[externalities]]—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a [[carbon tax]]) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.

Landsburg |type = PDF |accessdate = 6 July 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071705/http://finddumpsterrental.com/why-i-am-not-an-environmentalist.pdf |archive-date = 4 March 2016 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that [[paper recycling]] actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests, large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer "farmed" forests.&lt;ref name="armchair economist"&gt;Landsburg, Steven A. ''The Armchair Economist''. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

When foresting companies cut down trees, more are planted in their place; however, such "farmed" forests are inferior to virgin forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as virgin forests, causing widespread [[soil erosion]] and often requiring large amounts of [[fertilizer]] to maintain while containing little tree and wild-life [[biodiversity]] compared to virgin forests.&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;Baird, Colin (2004). ''Environmental Chemistry'' (3rd ed.). W. H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-4877-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be "more trees" is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.

In particular, wood from tropical rainforests is rarely harvested for paper because of their heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/f7795e/f7795e02.htm |title = How to make paper in the tropics |last = de Jesus |first = Simeon |date = 1975 |journal = Unasylva |doi =  |pmid =  |access-date =  |issue = 3 |volume = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is [[subsistence farming]] (48% of deforestation) and [[commercial agriculture]] (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/pub_07_financial_flows.pdf |author = UNFCCC |title = Investment and financial flows to address climate change |website = unfccc.int |publisher = UNFCCC |page = 81 |year = 2007 |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible income loss and social costs ===

In some countries, recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the [[karung guni]], [[zabbaleen]], the [[rag-and-bone man]], [[waste picker]], and [[junk man]]. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or [[economies of scale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nrdc.org/cities/recycling/recyc/appenda.asp |title = Too Good To Throw Away – Appendix A |publisher = NRDC |date = 30 June 1996 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf Mission Police Station]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513094320/http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf |date=13 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the [[remanufacturing]] market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor.&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010"&gt;''PBS NewsHour'', 16 February 2010. Report on the Zabaleen&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[parable of the broken window]], there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable, e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.&lt;ref name="Medina, M. 2000 51–69"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Medina, M. |year = 2000 |title = Scavenger cooperatives in Asia and Latin America |journal = Resources |volume = 31 |pages = 51–69 |doi = 10.1016/s0921-3449(00)00071-9 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.579.6981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling, there is a greater chance the poor will come in conflict with the large recycling organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16878461&amp;BRD=1698&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=21849&amp;rfi=6 |title = The News-Herald – Scrap metal a steal |publisher = Zwire.com |date =  |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92705125 |title = Raids On Recycling Bins Costly To Bay Area |publisher = NPR |date = 19 July 2008 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor, the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered "waste".&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" /&gt;

One labor-intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes, who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers.

Some recycling advocates believe that [[laissez-faire]] individual-based recycling does not cover all of society's recycling needs. Thus, it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program.&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" /&gt; Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to property blight.

== Public participation rates ==
[[File:Municipal recycling facilities, Montgomery County, MD. 2007, Credit USEPA (14410405277).jpg|thumb|[[Single-stream recycling]] increases public participation rates, but requires additional sorting]]
Changes that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include:
* [[Single-stream recycling]]
* [[Pay as you throw]] fees for trash

"Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25-fold, while recovery of the material remained below 5 percent."&lt;ref name="Moore08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Moore |first1 = C. J. |year = 2008 |title = Synthetic polymers in the marine environment: A rapidly increasing, long-term threat |journal = Environmental Research |volume = 108 |pages = 131–139 |doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2008.07.025 |pmid = 18949831 |issue = 2 |bibcode = 2008ER....108..131M }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} Many studies have addressed recycling behaviour and strategies to encourage community involvement in recycling programmes. It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schackelford | first=T.K. | year=2006 | title=Recycling, evolution and the structure of human personality | journal=Personality and Individual Differences | volume=41 | issue=8 | pages=1551–1556 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recycling behaviour is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programmes. However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure is unviable in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://sapiens.revues.org/index905.html |title = Pratarelli, M.E. (2010) "Social pressure and recycling: a brief review, commentary and extensions". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''3''' (1) |journal = S.a.p.i.en.s. Surveys and Perspectives Integrating Environment and Society |issue = 3.1 |date =  2010-02-04|accessdate = 6 November 2012 |last1 = Pratarelli |first1 = Marc E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter–gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.

== Recycling in art ==
[[File:Uniseafish.jpg|thumb|Uniseafish - made of recycled alu beer cans]]
Art objects are more and more often made from recycled material. 




In a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burn | first1 = Shawn | year = 2006 | title = Social Psychology and the Stimulation of Recycling Behaviors: The Block Leader Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 611–629 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00539.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.462.1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oskamp | first1 = Stuart | year = 1995 | title = Resource Conservation and Recycling: Behavior and Policy | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 157–177 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.

Many schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.

{{emotion}}

'''Regret''' is a negative [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[emotion]]al reaction to one's personal [[decision-making]], a choice resulting in action or inaction. Regret is related to perceived opportunity. Its intensity varies over time after the decision, in regard to action versus inaction, and in regard to [[self-control]] at a particular age. The self-recrimination which comes with regret is thought to spur corrective action and adaptation. In Western societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Definition==
Regret has been defined by psychologists in the late 1990s as a "negative [[emotion]] predicated on an upward, [[self-focusing|self-focused]], [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual inference]]".&lt;ref name=regretmost/&gt; Regret lingers where opportunity existed, with self-blame being a core element to ultimately spur corrective action in [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name=regretmost/&gt; Another definition is "an aversive emotional state elicited by a discrepancy in the outcome values of chosen vs. unchosen actions".&lt;ref&gt;Zeelenberg M, Pieters R. A theory of regret regulation 1.0. J Consum Psychol. 2007;17(1):3–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regret is distinct from [[disappointment]]; Both are negative emotional experiences relating to a loss outcome, and both have similar neuronal correlates. However, they differ in regard to feedback about the outcome, comparing the difference between outcomes for the chosen vs. unchosen action; In regret, full feedback occurs and with disappointment partial feedback. They also differ in regard to agency (self in regret versus external in disappointment).&lt;ref name=disapp/&gt;

== Models==
There are [[conceptual model]]s of regret in [[regret (decision theory)]] mostly in [[theoretical economics]] and [[finance]] under a field called [[behavioral economics]].  The term [[buyer's remorse]], also called buyer's regret which is assumed to be the cause for regret aversion.

Anticipated regret or how much regret one thinks one will feel in the future, appears to be overestimated for actions and choices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Looking Forward to Looking Backward The Misprediction of Regret|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/15/5/346|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2004-05-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 15102146|pages = 346–350|volume = 15|issue = 5|doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00681.x|first = Daniel T.|last = Gilbert|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Jane L.|last3 = Risen|first4 = Timothy D.|last4 = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Biased Forecasting of Postdecisional Affect|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/8/678|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17680936|pages = 678–681|volume = 18|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01958.x|first = Nick|last = Sevdalis|first2 = Nigel|last2 = Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be, in part, due to a tendency to underestimate the extent to which people attribute bad outcomes to external factors rather than to internal factors (i.e., themselves).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It can lead to inaction or inertia and [[omission bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dibonaventura | first1 = M | last2 = Chapman | first2 = GB | year = 2008 | title = Do decision biases predict bad decisions?

[[Existential]] regret has been specifically defined as "a profound desire to go back and change a past experience in which one has failed to choose consciously or has made a choice that did not follow one’s beliefs, values, or growth needs".&lt;ref name=Marijo_1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Marijo|title=Existential Regret: A Crossroads of Existential Anxiety and Existential Guilt|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|date=January 2004|volume=44|issue=1|pages=58–70|doi=10.1177/0022167803259752|url=http://jhp.sagepub.com/content/44/1/58.abstract|accessdate=15 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703091645/http://jhp.sagepub.com/content/44/1/58.abstract|archivedate=3 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments to measure regret in people having to make medical decisions have failed to address current concepts of regret and failed to differentiate regret from disappointment. They have also not looked for positive impacts of regret.&lt;ref name=instr&gt;Joseph-Williams N, Edwards A, Elwyn G. The importance and complexity of regret in the measurement of ‘good’ decisions: a systematic  review  and  a  content  analysis  of existing assessment instruments. Health Expect 2011; 14: 59-83  doi: 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00621.x {{PMID|20860776}}, PMCID:PMC5060557&lt;/ref&gt; Process regret may occur, if a person does not consider information about all available choices before making a decision.&lt;ref name=instr/&gt;

==Life domains==
A 2005 [[meta-analysis]] of 9 studies (7 US, one Germany, one Finland) about what adults regret most concluded, that overall adults regret choices regarding their education the most. Subsequent rankings included decisions about career, romance, and parenting. Education has been the forerunner of regret in the U.S. per [[Gallup survey]]s in 1949, 1953, and 1965. Education was the forerunner of regret because it is seen as something where circumstances could be changed: "In contemporary society, education is open to continual modification throughout life. With the rise of community colleges and student aid programs in recent decades, education of some sort is accessible to nearly all socioeconomic groups."This finding can be attributed to the principle of perceived opportunity. "People´s biggest regrets are a reflection of where in life they see their largest opportunities; that is, where they see tangible prospects for change, growth, and renewal.&lt;ref name="regretmost" /&gt;

In other cultures, regrets may be ranked differently depending on the perceived opportunity in a particular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilovich | first1 = T | last2 = Wang | first2 = RF | last3 = Regan | first3 = D | last4 = Nishina | first4 = S | year = 2003 | title = Regrets of action and inaction across cultures | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 61–71 | doi=10.1177/0022022102239155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of intensity==
===Action versus inaction===
There is an interplay between action versus inaction and time. Regrets of an action are more intense in the short term, whereas regrets of inaction are more intense over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilovich | first1 = T | last2 = Medvec | first2 = VH | year = 1995 | title = The experience of regret: What, when, and why | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 379–395 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
In a 2001 study, high intensity of regret and intrusive thoughts in older adults was related to [[self-control]], and low internal control was expected to be self-protective and help to decrease regret. In younger adults, internal-control facilitated active change and was associated with low intensity of regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wrosch | first1 = C | last2 = Heckhausen | first2 = J | year = 2002 | title = Perceived control of life regrets: Good for young and bad for old adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 340–350 | pmid = 12061416 | doi=10.1037/0882-7974.17.2.340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunity===
People's biggest regrets occur where they perceive the greatest and most important opportunity for corrective action.&lt;ref name="regretmost" /&gt; When no opportunity exists to improve conditions, thought processes mitigate the [[cognitive dissonance]] caused by regret, e.g. by [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], and reconstrual.&lt;ref name="regretmost" /&gt; Regret pushes people toward revised decision making and corrective action as part of [[learning]] that may bring improvement in life circumstances. A 1999 study measured regret in accordance to negative reviews with service providers. Regret was an accurate predictor of who switched providers. As more intense regret is experienced, the likelihood of initiating change is increased. Consequently, the more opportunity of corrective action available, the larger the regret felt and the more likely corrective action is achieved. Feeling regret spurs future action to make sure other opportunities are taken so that regret will not be experienced again. People learn from their mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeelenberg|first1=M|title=The use of crying over spilled milk: A note on the rationality and functionality of regret|journal=Philosophical Psychology| date=1999| volume=13| issue=951–5089| pages=326–340| doi=10.1080/095150899105800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost opportunity principle===
With a lost opportunity regret should intensify, not diminish, when people feel that they could have made better choices in the past but now perceive limited opportunities to take corrective action in the future. "People who habitually consider future consequences (and how they may avoid future negative outcomes) experience less, rather than more, intense regret after a negative outcome." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roese|first1=Neal J.|title=Counterfactual Thinking.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=Jan 1997|volume=121|issue=1|pages=133–148|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.121.1.133|pmid=9000895}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle offers another reason as to why education is the most regretted aspect in life. Education becomes a more limited opportunity as time passes. Aspects such as making friends, becoming more spiritual, and community involvement tend to be less regrettable which makes sense because these are also aspects in life that do not become limited opportunities. As the opportunity to remedy a situation passes, feelings of hopelessness may increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beike|first1=Denise|title=What We Regret Most Are Lost Opportunities: A Theory of Regret Intensity|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=December 19, 2008|volume=35|issue=3|pages=385–397|doi=10.1177/0146167208328329|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/35/3/385|accessdate=11 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115002431/http://psp.sagepub.com/content/35/3/385|archivedate=15 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of the lost opportunity principle can be seen as a lack of [[Closure (psychology)|closure]]: Low closure makes past occurrences feel unresolved. Low closure is associated with "reductions in self-esteem and persistent negative affect over time" and with the realization and regret of lost opportunity. High closure is associated with acceptance of lost opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beike|first1=Denise|last2=Wirth-Beaumont|first2=Erin|title=Psychological closure as a memory phenomenon| journal=Memory| date=2005| volume=13| issue=6| pages=574–593| doi=10.1080/09658210444000241| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210444000241|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lost opportunity principle suggests, that regret does not serve as a corrective motive (which the opportunity principle suggests). Instead, regret serves as a more general reminder to seize the day. {{Citation needed|reason = This is not common knowledge.

A 2016 review of past studies found risk factors for people to develop "decision regret" regarding their health care were: higher decisional conflict, lower satisfaction with the decision, [[adverse outcome]]s in physical health, and greater [[anxiety]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;Becerra Pérez MM, Menear M, Brehaut JC, Légaré F.Med Decis Making. Extent and Predictors of Decision Regret about Health Care Decisions: A Systematic Review. 2016 Aug;36(6):777-90. doi: 10.1177/0272989X16636113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
Research upon [[brain injury]] and [[fMRI]] have linked the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] to the processing of regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coricelli | first1 = G | last2 = Critchley | first2 = HD | last3 = Joffily | first3 = M | last4 = O'Doherty | first4 = JP | last5 = Sirigu | first5 = A | last6 = Dolan | first6 = RJ | year = 2007 | title = Regret and its avoidance: a neuroimaging study of choice behavior | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 1255–62 | doi = 10.1038/nn1514 | pmid = 16116457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coricelli | first1 = G | last2 = Dolan | first2 = RJ | last3 = Sirigu | first3 = A | year = 2007 | title = Brain, emotion and decision making: the paradigmatic example of regret | url = | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 258–65 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2007.04.003 | pmid = 17475537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completeness of feedback about the outcomes after making a decision determined whether persons experienced regret (outcomes from both the choice and the alternative) vs. disappointment (partial-feedback, seeing only the outcome from the choice) in a magnetoencephalography study. Another factor was the type of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]]: With personal decision making the neural correlates of regret could be seen, with external agency (computer choice) those of [[disappointment]]. Feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region.&lt;ref name=disapp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giorgetta | first1 = C | last2 = Grecucci | first2 = A | last3 = Bonini | first3 = N | last4 = Coricelli | first4 = G | last5 = Demarchi | first5 = G | last6 = Braun | first6 = C | last7 = Sanfey | first7 = AG | date = Jan 2013 | title = Waves of regret: a meg study of emotion and decision-making | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 38–51 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both regret and disappointment activated [[anterior insula]] and [[dorsomedial prefrontal cortex]] but only with regret the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was activated.&lt;ref&gt;Chua HF1, Gonzalez R, Taylor SF, Welsh RC, Liberzon I.Decision-related loss: regret and disappointment. Neuroimage. 2009 Oct 1;47(4):2031-40. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychopathic]] individuals do not show regret and remorse. This was thought to be due to an inability to generate this emotion in response to negative outcomes. However, in 2016, people with [[antisocial personality disorder]] and [[dissocial personality disorder]] were found to experience regret, but did not use the regret to guide their choice in behavior. There was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range of potential actions and estimating the outcome values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27911790 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1609985113 | volume=113 | title=Psychopathic individuals exhibit but do not avoid regret during counterfactual decision making | pmc=5167137 | year=2016 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=14438–14443 | last1 = Baskin-Sommers | first1 = A | last2 = Stuppy-Sullivan | first2 = AM | last3 = Buckholtz | first3 = JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other species==
A study published in 2014 by [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]] based at the [[University of Minnesota]] suggested that rats are capable of feeling regret about their actions. This emotion had never previously been found in any other [[mammals]] apart from humans. Researchers set up situations to induce regret, and rats expressed regret through both their behavior and specific neural patterns in brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of regret in rat decision-making on a neuroeconomic task |journal=Nature Neuroscience |date=2014-06-08 |last=Steiner |first=Adam P |last2=Redish |first2=A David |issn=1546-1726 |doi=10.1038/nn.3740 |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=995–1002 |pmid=24908102 |pmc=4113023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-pity''' is a [[psychological]] state of mind.

==Description==
Though the primary focus of self-pity is on the self and one's own emotions that are within, it also has a strong interpersonal component. Being an interpersonal emotion is directing the emotional feeling or response toward others with the goal of attracting attention, empathy or help. However, some who are dealing with self-pity usually look outside of themselves for the source of their problems which only leads to a downward spiral of issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stober|first=J|title=Self-Pity: Exploring the Links to Personality, Control Beliefs, and Anger|journal=Journal of Personality|year=2003|volume=71 | issue = 2|pages=183–220|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7102004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Shooting the messenger'''" is a [[metaphor]]ic phrase used to describe the act of blaming the [[Porter (carrier)|bearer]] of bad news.

Until the advent of modern telecommunication, messages were usually delivered by human envoys. For example, in [[war]], a messenger would be sent from one camp to another. If the message was unfitting, the receiver might blame the messenger for such bad news and take their anger out on them.

==History==
An analogy of the phrase can come from the breaching of an unwritten code of conduct in war, in which a commanding officer was expected to receive and send back emissaries or diplomatic envoys sent by the enemy unharmed. During the early [[Warring States]] period of China, the concept of chivalry and virtue prevented the executions of messengers sent by opposing sides.

An early literary citing of "shooting the messenger" is in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]] states'': "The first messenger, that gave notice of [[Lucullus]]' coming was so far from pleasing [[Tigranes II|Tigranes]] that, he had his head cut off for his pains; and no man dared to bring further information. Without any intelligence at all, Tigranes sat while war was already blazing around him, giving ear only to those who flattered him".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's ''Life of Lucullus'' (Dryden transl.), paragraph 25; a slightly different account (the messenger was hanged) is in Appian's ''Mithradatic Wars'', paragraph 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A related sentiment was expressed in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as "no one loves the messenger who brings bad news" or "no man delights in the bearer of bad news" ({{lang-gr| στέργει γὰρ οὐδεὶς ἄγγελον κακῶν ἐπῶν}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Antigone of Sophocles|others=Edited with introduction and notes by Sir Richard Jebb|chapter=Line 277|year=1891|author=Sophocles|chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0186%3Acard%3D237|publisher=Cambridge University Press}} At the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentiment that one should not shoot the messenger was expressed by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' (1598)&lt;ref&gt;Act I, scene 1, lines 95-103; "Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin to speak a truth. ... Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office, and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell, remember'd tolling a departed friend."&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'': [[Cleopatra]] threatens to treat the messenger's eyes as balls when told [[Mark Antony|Antony]] has married another, eliciting the response "Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match."&lt;ref&gt;II, 5; cf. I, 2 : "The nature of bad news infects the teller."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also applied to a [[town crier]], an officer of the court who made public pronouncements in the name of the ruling monarch, and often including bad news. Harming a town crier was considered treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bradford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8931000/8931369.stm|title=Top town crier to be crowned as Hebden Bridge hits 500|publisher=BBC|date=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freud and defense ==
[[Sigmund Freud]] considered shooting the messenger a "marginal case of this kind of [[Defence mechanism|defense]]...of fending off what is distressing or unbearable", citing the example of "the famous lament of the Spanish Moors ''[[Alhama de Granada|Ay de mi Alhama]]'', which tells how King [[Boabdil]] received the news of the fall of his city of [[Alhama de Granada|Alhama]]. He feels that this loss means the end of his rule. But he will not 'let it be true....He threw the letters in the fire and killed the messenger'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 454-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud added that "a further determinant of this behaviour of the king was his need to combat a feeling of powerlessness. By burning the letters and having the messenger killed he was still trying to show his absolute power."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl G. Jung]], a peer of Freud’s, describes the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] in the individual as part of the unconscious mind, which is largely negative. “Everyone carries a shadow", Jung wrote, "and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is". It may be in part one’s links to more primitive animal instincts, which are superseded in early childhood by the conscious mind. V.G. Hufnagel, a bioethics expert wrote, “the shadow of the institution protects its own fraternity".&lt;ref&gt;Hufnagel,V.G. (2014) “The Truth Hurts”, Introduction :Kill the Messinger, Kill the Message.&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternity members form a collective and share a collective consciousness with a predatory instinctive animal in nature and hold the fears of childhood. These fears stimulate actions to destroy any message that may harm them. There is no cognitive process in these actions. These are forced on death of an individual and of an idea through human sacrifice. There are religious aspects to these actions. The fraternity of authority believes it holds a right to exterminate those who could harm them.&lt;ref name="Jung, C.G. 1938 P.131"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1938). "Psychology and Religion." In CW 11: Psychology and Religion: West and East. P.131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung, C.G. 1938 P.131"/&gt; The shadow is a part of the "psychology of institutions". Institutions have enormous funds to use unlike an individual whistleblower. Institutions also have massive communication systems and a loyal population that supports the institution.

==Current application==
A modern version of "shooting the messenger" can be perceived when someone [[blame]]s the [[Mass media|media]] for presenting bad news about a favored cause, person, organization, etc. "Shooting the messenger" may be a time-honored emotional response to unwanted news, but it is not a very effective method of remaining well-informed."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Sanford, ''Don't Shoot the Messenger'' (2001) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting rid of the messenger may be a tactical move, but danger found in nondisclosure may result in either hostile responses or negative feedback from others. "People learn very quickly where this is the case, and will studiously avoid giving any negative feedback; thus the 'Emperor' continues with the self-delusion....Obviously this is not a recipe for success".&lt;ref&gt;Mike Robson/Ciaran Beary, ''Facilitating'' (1995) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] in ''Bright-sided/Smile or Die'' argued that a culture of "thinking positive" so as to "purge 'negative people' from the ranks...[fed into] the ''[[Financial crisis of 2007-2010|bubble-itis]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Barbar Ehrenreich, ''Smile or Die'' (London 2009) p. 188-9&lt;/ref&gt; of the 2000s.

Reactions to the [[whistleblowing]] organization [[WikiLeaks]] led to calls not to shoot the messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/julian-assange-dont-shoot-the-messenger-2153616.html |title=Julian Assange: 'Don't Shoot the Messenger' |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |accessdate=7 January 2011 |location=London |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar phrases==
A syntactically similar expression "Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best". It originated around 1860 in the [[Wild West]] of the United States when [[Oscar Wilde]], during his 1883 tour of the United States, saw this saying on a notice in a [[Leadville, Colorado]], saloon.&lt;ref name="Wilde's visit to Leadville documented at:"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | title=Oscar Wilde in Leadville | accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is sometimes attributed to [[Mark Twain]], but neither Wilde nor Twain ever claimed authorship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13422">The '''Social Protection Floor''' (SPF),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialsecurityextension.org/gimi/gess/ShowTheme.do?tid=1321&lt;/ref&gt; is the first level of [[social protection]] in a national social protection system. It is a basic set of [[social rights]] derived from [[human right]] treaties, including access to essential services (such as [[health service|health]], education, housing, water and sanitation, and others, as defined nationally) and [[social transfer]]s, in cash or in kind, to guarantee [[income security]], [[food security]], adequate nutrition and access to essential services.

As a result of the extreme inequality, social security schemes have been developed and implemented, through private and public initiatives, since the 1970s in Europe and subsequently in other parts of the world. However, the problem of poverty persists. According to the [[World Bank]], over a billion people, or roughly one in six, live in [[extreme poverty]] and 2.8 billion people live in poverty, meaning on less than 1USD and less than 2USD a day, respectively.

To remedy this situation and promote socio-economic development, the [[United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination]] (UNCEB) coined the concept of the SPF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/spfag/download/background/unceb2009-gfc-un.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015151102/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/spfag/download/background/unceb2009-gfc-un.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework aims to place governments as the central responsible actor for the promotion of four essential and universal guarantees, which would set the ground for a more comprehensive [[social protection]] system.

== {{anchor|User pages and user space}} Overview ==

The Social Protection Floor is a socio-economic development policy concept and a crisis management tool. It promotes a solid foundation for economic growth, provides a societal insurance against perpetuating poverty and mitigates the effects of economic shocks and crisis.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] Conventions are international instruments that have recognized these essential social rights and have been used as the legal basis to support the Social Protection Floor.

Founded on a rights-based approach, the Social Protection Floor encourages countries to aim towards a universal standard of social protection coverage. Since the context of each country differs in terms of institutional capacity, political ideologies, financial resources, economic structure and cultural values, each floor is defined by individual countries.

Building from past social protection programs, the SPF promotes a more coordinated design and implementation of social and labour policies in order to guarantee a country-defined basic set of social rights, services and facilities that every person should enjoy, which could be granted through:
* [[cash transfers]] such as a [[social pension]];
* [[conditional cash transfer]]s;
* universal access to health care services;
* food-based programs, as well as food stamps, vouchers and coupons;
* school supplies and uniforms;
* vocational and training programs for the unemployed;
* price subsidies for food, electricity, housing, or other public service; and
* other programs.

To insure continuity and sustainability, these strategies build on existing social protection mechanisms and include a mix of contributory and non-contributory, targeted and universal, public and private instruments – depending on the social, economic and political context. Countries are also encouraged to develop higher levels of social protection in line with their needs, preferences, and financial capacities.

A global coalition of [[United Nations]] agencies, international NGOs, development banks, bilateral organization and other development partners, the Social Protection Floor - Initiative Coalition (SPF-I Coalition), has been created to support countries with the establishment, expansion and edification of their national social protection floors.

== {{anchor|User pages and user space}} Strategy for the extension ==

The ultimate objective of the Social Protection Floor approach is to build a solid basis that would allow higher levels of protection, than simply the ground floor level. As economies grow and fiscal space is created, social protection systems can and should move up the Social Protection Floor ''staircase'', extending the scope, level and quality of benefits and services provided.

Within this strategy, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) has suggested a two-dimensional approach to develop the SPF including : 
* a ''horizontal coverage'', or the Social Protection Floor, providing access to essential health care for all, income security for children, assistance to the unemployed, underemployed and poor, and income security for the elderly and disabled; and
* a ''vertical coverage'' building on the first floor and providing more extensive and comprehensive social protection coverage.

[[File:Social Protection Staircase.JPG|right]]

This concept takes into consideration the national constraints of countries, while promoting a basic universal level of social protection to all. The gradual introduction and implementation of the social protection guarantees is essential for the development and sustainability of the system. In this way, countries do not lose sight of the overall objective of achieving comprehensive social protection for all; and they are able to assess and be constantly aware of the opportunity cost in terms of other guarantees that are put on hold when taking a decision on priorities. Formulating a package of guarantees as a floor should thus lead to rational cost/benefit-based policy decisions.

== {{anchor|User pages and user space}} Affordability ==

Ensuring a Social Protection Floor for the entire world population represents a considerable challenge, but experiences from countries all over the world and calculations by various UN agencies, including [[UNICEF]], show that a basic floor of social transfers is globally affordable at virtually any stage of economic development.

In 2008, the [[International Labour Organization]] published a cost-estimation study of 12 low-income countries in Africa and Asia that showed that the initial gross annual cost of a hypothetical basic social security package – that excluded access to essential health case because it is already to some extent financed – was projected to lie between 2.2 and 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2010.

There are many ways to attain affordable SFP coverage in middle- or low-income countries. While some countries seek to extend social insurance and combine it with social assistance, others subsidize social insurance coverage for the poor to enable them to enjoy participation in the general schemes, and still others seek to establish tax-financed universal schemes or conditional social transfer schemes. Each approach has its advantages and its limitations, depending on national values, past experience and institutional frameworks.

The core challenge for financing the basic social security guarantees remains that of securing the necessary fiscal space. For this reason, tax reforms may be necessary to increase fiscal resources, but also to enhance transparency, effectiveness and efficiency in tax collection.

In addition, measures may be required to maximize the administrative capacity to deliver benefits efficiently and inform the population about programmes. Evidence shows that good governance of social policies and programme is essential for efficient service delivery, monitoring, evaluation and financial management.

== {{anchor|User pages and user space}} The Coalition of the Social Protection Floor – Initiative ==

The Social Protection Floor Initiative (SPF-I) is a joint UN effort to build a global coalition of [[United Nations]] agencies, international NGOs, development banks, bilateral organisations and other development partners that are committed to collaborating at national, regional and global levels to support countries committed to building national social protection floors for their population.

The SPF-I was launched in April 2009 as one of the nine UN Chief Executives Board’s crisis initiatives – responding to repeated demands from member states for better coordinated technical, logistical and financial assistance from UN system agencies in times of crisis. The activities of the initiative are open for participation to all organisations that want to support the cause of strengthening social protection for all in need. Organizations that are involved include: ILO, [[World Health Organization]], [[FAO]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[OHCHR]], UN Regional Commissions, UNAIDS, UN-DESA, [[UNDP]], [[UNESCO]], [[FAO]], UNFPA, UN-HABITAT, [[UNHCR]], [[UNICEF]], UNODC, UNRWA, [[World Food Program]], WMO, [[World Bank]], ADB, BMZ, DFID, Helpage International, [[Save the Children]], ICSW, GIZ, ESN, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Finland, French International Health and Social Protection Agency, GIPS, and others.

Pulling away from traditional top-down implementation, SPFs are country-led and developed based on the existing framework of county-specific social protection systems, institutional and administrative structures, economic constraints, fiscal space, political dynamics and social policy needs, objectives and priorities. The Coalition members of the SPF-I play a consultative role and among other activities: 
* are engaged in advocacy initiatives to integrate SPFs into development strategies;
* offer technical and financial support to national SPF task forces;
* collect evidence, document experiences and develop;
* provide capacity building and training programmes together with the International Training Centre (ITC) in Turin and partner universities, including: the University of Maastricht, the Netherlands, the University of Lausanne, Switzerland and the University of Mauritius; and
* support South-South and triangular cooperation through several initiatives.

'''''The Continence of Scipio''''' ({{lang-nl|De grootmoedigheid van Scipio}}) is a circa 1653 painting by Dutch artist [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]]. It shows [[The Continence of Scipio|the continence of Scipio]] and is now in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam.

==Description==
The painting shows the moment when Scipio informs the groom that he can have his bride, as well as the riches that the bride's parents have just paid in ransom. Of the riches displayed, the [[Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)|ewer of the Amsterdam silversmith's guild]], a famous silver object by [[Adam van Vianen]], is also in the Rijksmuseum collection. Van den Eeckhout made another version of the same subject, that also features the ewer (lying on its side), which is now in the collection of the [[Toledo Museum of Art]]:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting is one of several paintings in the collection of art dealer D. Katz that were taken to the Führer museum in Linz. After WWII it was returned with other Nazi looted art to the Netherlands and has been on loan to the Rijksmuseum since. In 1966 it was noticed by the silver curator of art in the museum, Theresia M. Duyvené de Wit Klinkhamer, who included it in her overview of paintings that show the Adam van Vianen ewer.&lt;ref&gt;Th.M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">[[File:Oscillation amortie.svg|thumb|[[Damping|Damped oscillation]] is a typical transient response, where the output value oscillates until finally reaching a steady-state value (The [[underdamped]] response case).]]

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]], a '''transient response''' is the response of a system to a change from an [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] or a [[steady state]]. The transient response is not necessarily tied to abrupt events but to any event that affects the equilibrium of the system. The [[impulse response]] and [[step response]] are transient responses to a specific input (an impulse and a step, respectively).

==Damping==
The response can be classified as one of three types of [[damping]] that describes the output in relation to the [[steady-state response]].

;Underdamped
:An [[underdamped]] response is one that oscillates within a decaying [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]].  The more underdamped the system, the more oscillations and longer it takes to reach steady-state. Here [[damping ratio]] is always less than one.
;Critically damped
:A [[critically damped]] response is that response which reaches the steady-state value the fastest without being underdamped. It is related to [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] in the sense that it straddles the boundary of underdamped and [[overdamped]] responses. Here, damping ratio is always equal to one. There should be no oscillation about the steady state value in the ideal case.
;Overdamped
:An overdamped response is the response that does not oscillate about the steady-state value but takes longer to reach steady-state than the critically damped case. Here damping ratio is  greater than one.

==Properties==
[[File:Second order under-damped response.svg|thumb|Typical second order transient system properties]]
Transient response can be quantified with the following properties.
;Rise time
:[[Rise time]] refers to the time required for a signal to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. Typically, these values are 10% and 90% of the step height.
;Overshoot
:[[Overshoot (signal)|Overshoot]] is when a signal or function exceeds its target. It is often associated with [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]].
;Settling time
:[[Settling time]] is the time elapsed from the application of an ideal instantaneous step input to the time at which the output has entered and remained within a specified [[error band]].
;Delay-time
:The delay time is the time required for the response to reach half the final value the very first time.&lt;ref name="Ogata230"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Modern Control Engineering |edition=4 | first = Katsuhiko | last = Ogata | publisher = Prentice-Hall | isbn = 0-13-043245-8 | page = 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Peak time
:The peak time is the time required for the response to reach the first peak of the overshoot.&lt;ref name="Ogata230"/&gt;
;Steady-state error
:2003's ''Instrument Engineers' Handbook'' defines the steady-state error of a system as "the difference between the desired final output and the actual one" when the system reaches a [[steady state]], when its behavior may be expected to continue if the system is undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Instrument Engineers' Handbook: Process control and optimization | first = Béla G. | last = Lipták | edition = 4th | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8493-1081-4 | page = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A_Tree_of_twenty_vices_and_twenty_virtues_Wellcome_L0029368.jpg|thumb|Ink and Watercolour Circa 1420-30.]]
A '''tree of virtues''' (''arbor virtutum'') is a diagram used in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] tradition to display  the relationships between [[virtue]]s, usually juxtaposed with a '''tree of vices''' (''arbor vitiorum'') where the [[vice]]s are treated in a parallel fashion.
Together with  [[genealogical tree]]s,&lt;!--even earlier? genealogical trees certainly from the 14th century, e.g. File:Cod Crem 243 img01.jpg -- but these trees possibly from the 12th?--&gt; 
these diagrams qualify as among the earliest explicit [[tree structure|tree-diagrams]] in history, emerging in the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;genealogical stemmata since at least the 11th century, the ''arbor virtutum'' since at least the 12th; see Nora Gädeke, ''Zeugnisse Bildlicher Darstellung Der Nachkommenschaft Heinrichs I'',  Arbeiten zur Frühmittelalterforschung 22 (1992), p. 2. For the possibility of a genealogiacal stemma of the early 10th century, see Nora Gädeke, ''Eine Karolingergenealogie des frühen 10. Jahrhunderts?'', Francia 15 (1987), [http://francia.digitale-sammlungen.de/Blatt_bsb00016291,00793.html 778-792]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first appearing as illustrations in certain theological tracts, the concept becomes more popular in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and is also seen in courtly manuscripts such as the psalter of Robert de Lisle (c. 1310-1340).

The nodes of the tree-diagrams are the [[Cardinal Virtues]] and the [[Cardinal Vices]], respectively, each with a number of secondary virtues or secondary vices shown as leaves of the respective nodes.
While on a tree of virtues, the leaves point upward toward heaven, on a tree of vices the leaves point downward toward hell.
At the root of the trees, the virtues of ''humilitas'' "humility" and the vice of ''superbia'' "pride" is shown as the origin of all other virtues and vices, respectively. 
By this time, the concept of showing hierarchical concepts of medieval philosophy in diagrams also becomes more widespread. E.g. ms. [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal|Arsenal]] 1037 (14th century)  has a tree of virtue on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500993t/f18.image fol. 4v] and a tree of vices on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500993t/f19.image fol. 5r] as part of a collection of diagrams on a variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;''Septem hore canonice; Septem actus passionis Christi; Septem dona gratuita; Arbor virtutum; Arbor vicioru; Arbor sapientie; Duodecim prophete; Duodecim articuli fidei; Duodecim apostoli.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the trees are also further subdivided into a ternary structure, as follows:
*''[[humilitas]] radix virtutum''
**I. ''[[prudentia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
**II. ''[[wikt:fortitudo|fortitudo]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
**''semita vitalis''
***III. ''[[Justice (virtue)|iustitia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
***IIII. ''[[temperantia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
***''fructus spiritus''
****V. ''[[Faith|fides]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
****VI. ''[[spes]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
****VII. ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
*''[[Pride|superbia]] radix vitiorum''
**I. ''[[avaritia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
**II. ''[[invidia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
**''semita mortis''
***III. ''[[vanagloria|inanis gloria]]'' (seven sub-vices)
***IIII. ''[[wrath|ira]]'' (seven sub-vices)
***''fructus carnis''
****V. ''[[gluttony|gula]]'' (seven sub-vices)
****VI. ''[[acedia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
****VII. ''[[luxuria (vice)|luxuria]]'' (seven sub-vices)

In the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Pietro Bembo]] developed a similar flow-chart-like "moral schema" of sins punished in [[Divine Comedy|Dante]]'s ''Inferno'' and ''Purgatory''.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[set theory]], a '''universal set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a [[paradox]] ([[Russell's paradox]]) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

== Notation ==
There is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include '''V''', '''U''' and '''[[xi (letter)|ξ]]'''.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the [[axiom of regularity]], and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.

===Russell's paradox===
{{Main|Russell's paradox}}
Russell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and other set theories that include [[Zermelo]]'s [[axiom of comprehension]].
This axiom states that, for any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and any set {{mvar|A}}, there exists another set 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
that contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  If a universal set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then
there would also exist another set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as [[Bertrand Russell]] observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.

===Cantor's theorem===
{{Main|Cantor's theorem}}
A second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the [[power set]] of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &lt;math&gt;V \in V&lt;/math&gt; is true). In these theories, Zermelo's [[axiom of comprehension]] does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a [[non-well-founded set theory]].
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,&lt;ref&gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flash Sheridan |date=2016 |title=A Variant of Church’s Set Theory with a Universal Set in which the Singleton Function is a Set |url=http://www.logic-center.be/Publications/Bibliotheque/SheridanVariantChurch.pdf |journal=Logique et Analyse |volume=59 |issue=233 |at=§0.2 |doi=10.2143/LEA.233.0.3149532|lay-url=http://www-logic.stanford.edu/seminar/1314/Sheridan_Fixing_Freges_Set_Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp's, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&lt;ref&gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent advances in this area have been made by [[Randall Holmes]] who published an online draft version of the book ''[[Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ |title=Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[positive set theory]], where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the [[positive formula]]s (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===
{{main|Universe (mathematics)}}
The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]] rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a [[universal class (set theory)|universal class]] is that the universal class does not contain itself, because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements of other classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The [[category of sets]] can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.

'''''Zugzwang''''' (German for "compulsion to move", {{IPA-de|ˈtsuːktsvaŋ|pron}}) is a situation found in [[chess]] and other games wherein one [[player (game)|player]] is put at a disadvantage because they must make a move when they would prefer to pass and not move. The fact that the player is compelled to move means that their position will become significantly weaker. A player is said to be "in zugzwang" when any possible move will worsen their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003a|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in [[combinatorial game theory]], where it means that it directly changes the outcome of the game from a win to a loss, but the term is used less precisely in games such as chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berlekamp|Conway|Guy|1982|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elkies|1996|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putting the opponent in zugzwang is a common way to help the superior side win a game, and in some cases, it is necessary in order to make the win possible.&lt;ref name=mull08p173&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Pajeken|2008|pp=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''zugzwang'' was used in [[German (language)|German]] chess literature in 1858 or earlier,&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt; and the first known use of the term in English was by [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=winter08 /&gt; The concept of zugzwang was known to players many [[centuries]] before the term was coined, appearing in an [[endgame study]] published in 1604 by [[Alessandro Salvio]], one of the first writers on the game, and in [[shatranj]] studies dating back to the early 9th century, over 1000 years before the first known use of the term.

Positions with zugzwang occur fairly often in chess [[Chess endgame|endgames]], especially in [[King and pawn versus king endgame|king and pawn endgames]]. According to [[John Nunn]], positions of reciprocal zugzwang are surprisingly important in the analysis of endgames.&lt;ref name=nunn95p6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn99p7&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1999|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Etymology==
The word comes from German ''Zug'' 'move' + ''Zwang'' 'compulsion', so that ''Zugzwang'' means 'being forced to make a move'. Originally the term was used interchangeably with the term ''zugpflicht'' 'obligation to make a move' as a general game rule. Games like chess and [[checkers]] have "zugzwang" (or "zugpflicht"): a player ''must'' always make a move on his turn even if this is to their disadvantage. [[wargaming|Tabletop war games]] or [[role playing games]] do not: a player can simply decide to "wait" or "do nothing" on their turn. Over time, the term became especially associated with chess.

According to chess [[historian]] [[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], the term had been in use in German chess circles in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=winter97&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Pages 353–358 of the September 1858 Deutsche Schachzeitung had an unsigned article "Zugzwang, Zugwahl und Privilegien". F. Amelung employed the terms Zugzwang, Tempozwang and Tempozugzwang on pages 257–259 of the September 1896 issue of the same magazine. When a perceived example of zugzwang occurred in the third game of the 1896–97 world championship match between Steinitz and Lasker, after 34...Rg8, the Deutsche Schachzeitung (December 1896, page 368) reported that "White has died of zugzwang".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest known use of the term ''zugzwang'' in English was on page 166 of the February 1905 issue of ''[[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker's]] Chess Magazine''.&lt;ref name=winter08&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term did not become common in English-language chess sources until the 1930s, after the publication of the English translation of Nimzowitsch's ''[[My System]]'' in 1929.&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt;

==History==
The concept of zugzwang, if not the term, must have been known to players for many centuries. Zugzwang is required to win the elementary (and common) [[Checkmate#King and rook|king and rook versus king]] [[endgame (chess)|endgame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003a|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the king and rook (or differently-named pieces with the same powers) have been chess pieces since the earliest versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davidson|1981|pp=21–22,41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of zugzwang is also seen in the 1585 [[endgame study]] by [[Giulio Cesare Polerio]], published in 1604 by [[Alessandro Salvio]], one of the earliest writers on the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|pp=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only way for White to win is 1.Ra1 Kxa1 2.Kc2, placing Black in zugzwang. The only legal move is 2...g5, whereupon White [[promotion (chess)|promotes]] a pawn first and then [[checkmate]]s with 3.hxg5 h4 4.g6 h3 5.g7 h2 6.g8=Q h1=Q 7.Qg7#&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sukhin|2007|pp=21, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Bertin]] refers to zugzwang in ''The Noble Game of Chess'' (1735), wherein he documents 19 rules about chess play. His 18th rule is: "To play well the latter end of a game, you must calculate who has the move, on which the game always depends."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-André Danican Philidor]] wrote in 1777 of the position illustrated that after White plays 36.Kc3, Black "is obliged to move his rook from his king, which gives you an opportunity of taking his rook by a double check [sic], or making him [[checkmate|mate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philidor|2005|pp=272–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasker explicitly cited a mirror image of this position (White: king on f3, queen on h4; Black: king on g1, rook on g2) as an example of zugzwang in ''Lasker's Manual of Chess''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasker|1960|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British master [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]] analyzed a similar position in the same endgame, giving a maneuver that resulted in the superior side reaching the initial position, but now with the inferior side on move and in zugzwang. Walker wrote of the superior side's decisive move: "throwing the move upon Black, in the initial position, and thereby winning".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1846|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zugzwang in chess==
There are three types of chess positions:
# each side would benefit if it were their turn to move
# only one player would be at a disadvantage if it were their turn to move
# both players would be at a disadvantage if it were their turn to move.
The great majority of positions are of the first type.  In chess literature, most writers call positions of the second type ''zugzwang'', and the third type ''reciprocal zugzwang'' or ''mutual zugzwang''.  Some writers call the second type a ''squeeze'' and the third type ''zugzwang''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|1970|pp=196–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally in chess, having [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] is desirable because the player who is to move has the advantage of being able to choose a move that improves their situation. Zugzwang typically occurs when "the player to move cannot do anything without making an important concession".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Perlo|2006|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zugzwang most often occurs in the endgame when the number of pieces, and so the number of possible moves, is reduced, and the exact move chosen is often critical. The first diagram shows the simplest possible example of zugzwang. If it is White's move, they must either [[stalemate]] Black with 1.Kc6 or abandon the [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], allowing 1...Kxc7 with a draw. If it is Black's move, the only legal move is 1...Kb7, which allows White to win with 2.Kd7 followed by [[Promotion (chess)|queening]] the pawn on the next move.

The second diagram is another simple example. Black, on move, must allow White to play Kc5 or Ke5, when White wins one or more [[pawn (chess)|pawns]] and can advance his own pawn toward [[promotion (chess)|promotion]]. White, on move, must retreat his [[king (chess)|king]], when Black is out of danger.&lt;ref name=flear04p11&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2004|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squares d4 and d6 are ''[[corresponding squares]]''. Whenever the white king is on d4 with White to move, the black king must be on d6 to prevent the advance of the white king.

In many cases, the player having the move can put the other player in zugzwang by using ''[[triangulation (chess)|triangulation]]''. This often occurs in king and pawn endgames. Pieces other than the king can also triangulate to achieve zugzwang, such as in the [[Philidor position]]. Zugzwang is a mainstay of [[chess composition]]s and occurs frequently in [[endgame study|endgame studies]].

In the position on the right, White has just gotten his king to a6, where it attacks the black pawn on b6, tying down the black king to defend it.  White now needs to get his [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] to f7 or e8 to attack the pawn on g6.  Play continued:
: '''57... Nc8'''
: '''58. Bd5 Ne7'''

Now the bishop is able to make a [[tempo (chess)|tempo]] move.  It is able to move while still attacking the pawn on g6, and preventing the black king from moving to c6.

and Black is in zugzwang.  Knights are unable to lose a tempo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; so moving the knight would allow the bishop to capture the {{chessgloss|kingside}} pawns.  The black king must give way.

and White has a won position.  Either one of White's {{chessgloss|queenside}} pawns will promote or the white king will attack and win the black kingside pawns and a kingside pawn will promote.  Black [[resign (chess)|resigned]] seven moves later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silman|2007|pp=516–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Averbakh|1984|pp=113–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2007|pp=286–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andy Soltis]] says that this is "perhaps Fischer's most famous endgame".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|2003b|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Reciprocal zugzwang, White to move draws, Black to move loses.
}}
A special case of zugzwang is ''reciprocal zugzwang'' or ''mutual zugzwang'', which is a position such that whoever is to move is in zugzwang. Studying positions of reciprocal zugzwang is in the analysis of endgames.&lt;ref name=nunn95p6&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn99p7 /&gt; A position of mutual zugzwang is closely related to a game with a Conway value of zero in [[Combinatorial game theory|game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stiller|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a position with reciprocal zugzwang, only the player to move is actually in zugzwang.  However, the player who is not in zugzwang must play carefully because one inaccurate move can cause him to be put in zugzwang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Müller|Pajeken|2008|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is in contrast to regular zugzwang, because the superior side usually has a [[waiting move]] to put the opponent in zugzwang.&lt;ref name=nunn99p7 /&gt;

The diagram on the right shows a position of reciprocal zugzwang.  If Black is to move, 1... Kd7 is forced, which loses because White will move 2. Kb7, promote the pawn, and win.  If White is to move the result is a draw as White must either stalemate Black with 1. Kc6 or allow Black to {{chessgloss|capture}} the pawn. Since each side would be in zugzwang if it were his move, it is a reciprocal zugzwang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooper|1970|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Averbakh|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme type of reciprocal zugzwang, called ''trébuchet'', is shown in the diagram. It is also called a ''full-point mutual zugzwang'' because it will result in a loss for the player in zugzwang, resulting a full point for his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever is to move in this position must abandon his own [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], thus allowing his opponent to capture it and proceed to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] the remaining pawn, resulting in an easily winnable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flear|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corresponding squares]] are squares of mutual zugzwang.  When there is only one pair of corresponding squares, they are called ''mined squares''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dvoretsky|2003|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A player will fall into zugzwang if they move their king onto the square and his opponent is able to move onto the corresponding square.  In the diagram on the right, if either king moves onto the square marked with the dot of the same color, it falls into zugzwang if the other king moves into the mined square near them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dvoretsky|2006|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zugzwang in the middlegame and complex endgames==
Alex Angos notes that, "As the number of pieces on the board increases, the probability for ''zugzwang'' to occur decreases."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, zugzwang is very rarely seen in the [[middlegame (chess)|middlegame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game [[Friedrich Sämisch|Fritz Sämisch]] versus [[Aron Nimzowitsch]], [[Copenhagen]] 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102400 Sämisch vs. Nimzowitsch]&lt;/ref&gt; is often called the "Immortal Zugzwang Game". According to Nimzowitsch, writing in the ''[[Wiener Schachzeitung]]'' in 1925, this term originated in "Danish chess circles".&lt;ref name=winter97 /&gt; Some consider the final position to be an extremely rare instance of zugzwang occurring in the middlegame.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reinfeld|1958|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with White [[resign (chess)|resigning]] in the position in the diagram.

White has a few pawn moves which do not lose material, but eventually he will have to move one of his pieces. If he plays 1.Rc1 or Rd1, then 1...Re2 traps White's queen; 1.Kh2 fails to 1...R5f3, also trapping the queen, since White cannot play 2.Bxf3 because the bishop is [[pin (chess)|pinned]] to the king; 1.g4 runs into 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3? Rh2 mate. Angos analyzes 1.a3 a5 2.axb4 axb4 3.h4 Kh8 (waiting) 4.b3 Kg8 and White has run out of waiting moves and must lose material. Best in this line is 5.Nc3!? bxc3 6.bxc3, which just leaves Black with a serious positional advantage and an extra pawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angos|2005|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other moves lose material in more obvious ways.

However, since Black would win even without the zugzwang,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nunn|1981|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is debatable whether the position is true zugzwang. Even if White could pass his move he would still lose, albeit more slowly, after 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3 Rxf3, trapping the queen and thus winning queen and bishop for two rooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horowitz|1971|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]] thus considers it a misnomer to call this a true zugzwang position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golombek|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Immortal Zugzwang Game#Objections to the sobriquet|Immortal Zugzwang Game: Objections to the sobriquet]].

The queen cannot move without abandoning either its defense of the bishop on g5 or of the g2 square, where it is preventing ...Qg2#. White's move 35.f6 loses the bishop: 35...Rxg5 36. f7 Rg2+, forcing [[checkmate|mate]]. The move 35.Kg1 allows 35...Qh1+ 36.Kf2 Qg2+ followed by [[capture (chess)|capturing]] the bishop.

Soltis writes that his "candidate for the ideal zugzwang game" is the following game {{harvnb|Soltis|1978|p=55}}, Podgaets–[[Mark Dvoretsky|Dvoretsky]], [[USSR]] 1974: '''1. d4 c5 2. d5 e5 3. e4 d6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Bg5! 8. Bb5+ Kf8!''' Black exchanges off his {{chessgloss|bad bishop}}, but does not allow White to do the same. '''9. Bxg5 Qxg5 10. h4 Qe7 11.

(second diagram) Now all of White's piece moves allow checkmate or ...Rxf2 with a crushing attack (e.g. 31.Qxf3 Qh2#; 31.Rb1 Rxf2 32.Qxg4 Qh2#). That leaves only moves of White's b-pawn, which Black can ignore, e.g. 31.b3 Kg7 32.b4 Kh6 33.bxc5 bxc5 and White has run out of moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soltis|1978|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''0–1'''

| Position after 9...axb5. According to Rowson, White is in ''Zugzwang Lite''.
}}
[[Jonathan Rowson]] coined the term ''Zugzwang Lite'' to describe a situation, sometimes arising in symmetrical [[chess opening|opening]] variations, where White's "extra move" is a burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowson|2005|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites as an example of this phenomenon in [[Julian Hodgson|Hodgson]] versus [[Keith Arkell|Arkell]] at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] 2001. The position at left arose after '''1. c4 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. a3 a6 6. Rb1 Rb8 7. b4 cxb4 8. axb4 b5 9. cxb5 axb5''' (see diagram). Here Rowson remarks, &lt;blockquote&gt;Both sides want to push their d-pawn and play Bf4/...Bf5, but White has to go first so Black gets to play ...d5 before White can play d4. This doesn't matter much, but it already points to the challenge that White faces here; his most natural continuations allow Black to play the moves he wants to. I would therefore say that White is in 'Zugzwang Lite' and that he remains in this state for several moves.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The game continued '''10. Nf3 d5 11. d4 Nf6 12. Bf4 Rb6 13. 0-0 Bf5 14. Rb3 0-0 15. Ne5 Ne4 16. h3 h5!? 17. Kh2'''. The position is still almost symmetrical, and White can find nothing useful to do with his extra move. Rowson whimsically suggests 17.h4!?, forcing Black to be the one to break the symmetry. '''17... Re8!''' Rowson notes that this is a useful waiting move, covering e7, which needs protection in some lines, and possibly supporting an eventual ...e5 (as Black in fact played on his 22nd move). White cannot copy it, since after 18.Re1? Nxf2 Black would win a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]. After '''18. Be3?! Nxe5! 19. dxe5 Rc6!''' Black seized the initiative and went on to win in 14 more moves.

Another instance of ''Zugzwang Lite'' occurred in [[Lajos Portisch]] versus [[Mikhail Tal]], [[Candidates Match]] 1965, again from the [[English Opening#Common responses|Symmetrical Variation]] of the [[English Opening]], after '''1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. 0-0 0-0 7. d3 a6 8. a3 Rb8 9. Rb1 b5 10. cxb5 axb5 11. b4 cxb4 12. axb4 d6 13. Bd2 Bd7''' (see diagram). Soltis wrote, "It's ridiculous to think Black's position is better. But Mikhail Tal said it is easier to play. By moving second he gets to see White's move and then decide whether to match it."&lt;ref name="Soltis2008"&gt;Andrew Soltis, "Going Ape", ''[[Chess Life]]'', February 2008, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; '''14. Qc1''' Here, Soltis wrote that Black could maintain equality by keeping the symmetry: 14...Qc8 15.Bh6 Bh3. Instead, he plays to prove that White's queen is misplaced by breaking the symmetry. '''14... Rc8! 15. Bh6 Nd4!''' Threatening 15...Nxe2+. '''16. Nxd4 Bxh6 17. Qxh6 Rxc3 18. Qd2 Qc7 19. Rfc1 Rc8''' Although the pawn structure is still symmetrical, Black's control of the {{chessgloss|file|c-file}} gives him the advantage.&lt;ref name="Soltis2008"/&gt; Black ultimately reached an endgame two pawns up, but White managed to hold a draw in 83 moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1113167 |title=Portisch vs. Tal, Candidates Match 1965 |website=ChessGames.com |accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[First-move advantage in chess#Symmetrical openings]] for more details.
