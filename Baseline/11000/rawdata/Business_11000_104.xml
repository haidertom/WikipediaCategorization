The firm has a history of motorcycle and tricycle assembly in [[Nigeria]].

==History==
Boulos' history began in [[Lagos]] as a store that sells jewelry and other small articles to the upper middle class in Lagos. The jewelry business was managed by George Boulos, a Lebanese goldsmith who immigrated to [[Nigeria]] in 1936, George developed relationships with his client which proved useful down the road.&lt;ref name="234next" /&gt; In mid-1950s, George's sons, Anthony and Gabriel expanded the family business with the importation of [[Miele]], [[Durkopp]] and Göricke motorcycles and in 1959, the firm began importing [[Suzuki]] motorcycles. The company's profile grew from there and the firm was incorporated in 1964. Towards the end of the 1960s, the firm established a factory in Oregun, Lagos to assembly Suzuki motorcycles from semi and completely knocked down parts, it was the first company in Nigeria to assemble motorcycles in Nigeria and had a capacity to assemble 7,200 motorcycles at a shift. In 1978 when the government of Nigerian placed a ban on importation of completely built motorcycles, Boulos' profile was enhanced and it became the leading motorcycle seller in the country.&lt;ref name="nbd" /&gt; 

In 1975, the firm acquired land at Ogba industrial estate beginning a process of complete manufacture of Suzuki motorcycles. The company also developed a distribution strategy that led to the creation of service centers across the country, stocking spare parts and inclusion of a Suzuki trained mechanic at each center.&lt;ref name="nbd" /&gt;

In 1985, the Boulos family diversified their interest in Nigeria with the establishment of Bel Impex Limited, a tissue paper producer.&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria-CPLF - BEL IMPEX PROJECT." MENA Report (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010 and 2016, the company represented Piaggio India and partially assembled tricycles in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Boulos Assembles Tricycles with 40% Local Content - Motoring World Nigeria |url=http://motoringworldng.com/boulos-assembles-tricycles-with-40-local-content/ |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bticino S.p.A.''' is an Italian [[metalworking]] company that operates in the field of electrical low voltage equipment used for residential, employment and production. Bticino proposes solutions for the energy distribution, for the communication ([[intercom]]s and video intercoms) and for the control of light, sound, climate and security.

==History==
Founded in 1936 by brothers Arnaldo, Luigi and Ermanno Bassani with the name of Ticino Electric Switches to produce metal smallwares of different applications. Since 1948, the company became Bassani SpA and specializes itself in the manufacture of [[electrical component]]s used inside houses, in order to meet the growing demand resulting from post-conflict reconstruction.

Responding to changes in electrical technology and the demands of living spaces, Bassani Ticino (name adopted in 1974) developed a set of devices to control the distribution of [[low voltage]] energy, designing a range of products – from the "[[electric switchboard]]" to the switches – which combine the technical and functional features related to the installation mode, with special attention to drawing.

In 1989, Bassani Ticino joined the French group [[Legrand (company)|Legrand]], changing its name to BTicino.
Bticino was the first firm to conceive the switches as furniture (not only as industrial components), developing a specific treatment aimed at improving product quality and simplifying implementation.

The company became famous in the Italian market during the 50s; "Domino" and "Sicura" (“Safe”) were the names of the first series that got a big success.
The products of the '60s are characterized by ease of assembly and by modularity: they had spread the rectangular box, which represents the current standard.
The Magic Series (1961) is the first case of [[power socket]] with modular switches.

The issue of security becomes increasingly important as it increases the capillary diffusion of the electrical systems, which make it more likely an accidental contact with an [[electrical conductor]] in tension.
It is then built and patented a [[circuit breaker]] called a “[[residual current device]]” (1965); it’s high-power switching, with the addition of a differential [[transformer]].

The company is also known over the years for the plaques that surround the normal switches inside the house.
With the Series Living (1985) and the subsequent Light and Living International (1996) are introduced devices of multifunctional control of individual components.

In 2001 Bticino launched the first MyHome [[Domotics]] system based on [[bus SCS]] technology.
Continuing on the path toward automation, Axolute series (2005) first proposed the integration of video-intercom with domestic installation, while Axolute Nighter &amp; Whice (2008) marks a further step towards aesthetics simplification of electrical equipment for residential use.

In 2006 it was made available the protocol  [[OpenWebNet]], that allows interaction with the Domotics plant through the use of appropriate Gateway.

In 2007 Bticino obtained a place on www.grandesuccesso.it, worldwide website dedicated to reward success and quality (as a cause of success itself).

==The Company ==
The company is part of the International Group [[Legrand (company)|Legrand]] and operates both on the Italian market and on the Worldwide one with over 60 offices abroad.
The main products in the field of [[electrical equipment]] are traditional and domotics switches, plates, [[residual current device]]s, intercoms and video intercoms.

The main office and headquarter is in [[Varese]], where there are 1500 employees, split between design, production, quality, test, marketing, administrative and commercial offices. Other important locations are Erba, where all the [[domotics]] products and video intercoms are developed and produced; Ospedaletto Lodigiano where is located the central [[warehouse]]; Bodio, where the plaques are made; Azzano San Paolo and Torre del Greco, where are developed and manufactured devices industrial and [[residual current device]].

BTicino is present on many markets: Europe ([[Belgium]], Spain), Latin America ([[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], Costa Rica, [[Venezuela]], Chile, [[Peru]]), Asia ([[Thailand]], China), and the [[United States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5397">The '''business mileage reimbursement rate''' is an optional standard mileage rate used in the [[United States]] for purposes of computing the allowable business deduction, for [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax purposes]] under the [[Internal Revenue Code]], at {{usc|26|162}}, for the business use of a vehicle. Under the law, the taxpayer for each year is generally entitled to deduct either the actual expense amount, or an amount computed using the standard mileage rate, whichever is greater.

The business mileage reimbursement rate is also used by some employers for computing employee reimbursement amounts when an employee operates a motor vehicle not owned by the employer for the employer's business purposes. The [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) sets the rate for federal jobs. In general, the GSA rate matches the annual rate set by the IRS, although by law the government employee reimbursement rate cannot exceed the mileage rate set by the IRS for business deductions.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances'', 5 U.S.C. 5704(a)(1), Available from: [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html US Code Main Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130171856/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html |date=January 30, 2009 }}, Government Printing Office; Accessed January 28, 2009. "In any year in which the Internal Revenue Service establishes a single standard mileage rate for optional use by taxpayers in computing the deductible costs of operating their automobiles for business purposes, the rate per mile established by the Administrator (of the GSA) shall not exceed the single standard mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reimbursement by an employer on a per-mile basis is also used in other countries; it offers a similar simplification to payment of subsistence [[per diem]].

{{Donald Trump series}}

[[Donald Trump]] has pursued business deals in [[Russia]] since 1987, and has sometimes traveled there to explore potential business opportunities. In 1996, Trump [[trademark]] applications were submitted for potential Russian [[real estate development]] deals. Trump's partners and children have repeatedly visited [[Moscow]], connecting with [[Real estate development|developers]] and [[government official]]s to explore [[joint venture]] opportunities. Trump was never able to successfully conclude any real estate deals in Russia. However, individual Russians have invested heavily in Trump properties, and following Trump's bankruptcies in the 1990s he borrowed money from Russian sources. In 2008 his son [[Donald Trump Jr.]] said that Russia was an important source of money for the Trump businesses.

In January 2017, [[BuzzFeed]] reported the existence of the unverified [[Trump–Russia dossier]] (also called the Steele dossier), which alleges connections between Trump associates and Russia. Trump responded the next day, and again at a February news conference, that he has no financial connections to Russia. In response to ongoing questions, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated in May that Trump has no business connections to Russia. Also in May, Trump's tax lawyers sent a letter to the  Senate Judiciary Committee saying Trump had not received any income from Russian sources over the past 10 years "with a few exceptions".

Trump's pre-Presidential business dealings with Russia are reportedly being scrutinized by the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|special counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/trump-russia-investigation/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 28, 2018 |title=Mueller team asks about Trump's Russian business dealings as he weighed a run for president |first=Kara |last=Scannell |first2=Pamela |last2=Brown |first3=Gloria |last3=Borger |first4=Jim |last4=Sciutto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, ''The Daily Beast'' reported on a search engine optimization project intended to minimize public awareness of Trump's connections to an associate who worked on these projects with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-online-campaign-to-whitewash-donald-trumps-russian-business-ties|title=Inside the Online Campaign to Whitewash the History of Donald Trump's Russian Business Associates|last=Jones|first=Lachlan Markay{{!}}Dean Sterling|date=2018-07-05|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming well known ==
In 1987, Trump visited Russia to investigate developing a hotel, invited by Ambassador [[Yuri Dubinin]] whom he had met in New York the year before.&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;{{cite book |first=Luke |last=Harding |author-link=Luke Harding |date=November 16, 2017 |title=The Hidden History of Trump's First Trip to Moscow (excerpt from ''Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win'') |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0525520931 |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842 |via=[[Politico]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Luke Harding]] alleged in 2017 that this trip likely began a long-term cultivation operation typical of the [[KGB]]'s Political Intelligence Department, under written directives initiated by [[First Chief Directorate]] head [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], to recruit politically ambitious Westerners susceptible to flattery, egotism and greed.&lt;ref name=Harding /&gt;

In 1996, Trump partnered with Liggett-Ducat, a small company, and planned to build an upscale residential development on a Liggett-Ducat property in Moscow. Trump commissioned New York architect Ted Liebman, who did the sketches. Trump visited Moscow again with [[Howard Lorber]] to scout potential properties for "skyscrapers and hotels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Solo|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo|website=The New Yorker|date=May 19, 1997|access-date=March 6, 2018|last1=Singer|first1=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that trip, Trump promoted the proposal and acclaimed the [[Russian economy|Russian economic market]]. At a news conference reported by ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', Trump said he hadn't been "as impressed with the potential of a city as I have been with Moscow" in contrast to other cities had visited "all over the world."&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;

By this time, Trump had  made known his desire to build in Moscow to government officials for almost ten years "ranging from the Soviet leader [[Mikhail S. Gorbachev]] (they first met in Washington in 1987) to the military figure [[Alexander Lebed]]."&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt; Moscow's mayor, [[Yuri M. Luzhkov]], showed Trump plans for a very large shopping mall to be located underground in the vicinity of the [[Kremlin]]. The mayor complimented Trump's suggestion that this mall should have access to the [[Moscow Metro]], and it was eventually connected to the [[Okhotny Ryad (Moscow Metro)|Okhotny Ryad]] station. Although the 1996 residential development did not happen, Trump was by this time well known in Russia.&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

A wide-ranging [[business strategy|business stratagem]] included Russia in ventures intended to internationally expand the [[The Trump Organization|Trump brand]]. It was in the mid-2000s that Trump transitioned from building and investing in real estate to simply licensing his name to hotels, [[condominium]]s, and [[commercial towers]]. Although a strategy of taking a percentage from the sales was successful in other countries, his terms were not agreeable to Russians and conflicted with their way of doing business with [[List of hotels in the United States|American hotel chains]].&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belton&gt;{{cite news

Between 2000–2010, Trump partnered with a development company headquartered in New York represented by a Russian immigrant, [[Felix Sater]]. During this period, they partnered for an assortment of deals that included building [[Trump towers]] internationally and Russia was included. For example, in 2005 Slater acted as an agent for building a Trump tower alongside Moscow River with letters of intent in hand and "square footage was being analyzed."&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

In 2006, Trump's children [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]] and [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]] stayed in the [[Hotel National, Moscow]] for several days, across from [[the Kremlin]], to see promising partners, with the intent of doing real estate development deals.&lt;ref name=Meagan&gt;{{cite news

Trump was associated with [[Tevfik Arif]], formerly a Soviet commerce official and founder of a development company called the [[Bayrock Group]], of which Sater was also a partner. Bayrock searched for deals in Russia while Trump branded towers were attempting to further expand in the United States. Sater said, "We looked at some very, very large properties in Russia," on the scale of "...a large Vegas high-rise."&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt; In 2007, Bayrock organized a potential deal in Moscow between Trump International Hotel and Russian investors.&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

During 2006–2008, Trump's company applied for a number of trademarks in Russia with the goal of real estate developments. These trademark applications include: Trump, Trump Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home.&lt;ref name=many&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Trump's Many, Many, Many, Many Ties to Russia|url=http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=check&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aleem|first1=Zeeshan|title=Fact-checking Trump's claim that he has no business ties to Russia|url=https://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/17/14622504/trump-russia-business-ties-fact-check|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he said as a speaker at a Manhattan real estate conference that he feared the outcome of doing business deals in Russia, but he really prefers "Moscow over all cities in the world" and that within 18 months he had been in Russia a half-dozen times.&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

In a 2015 interview, Trump said that his repeated attempts to launch business deals with Russians resulted in contacts with "…the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary."&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

Trump Super Premium Vodka, bottles glazed with 24-karat gold, debuted in 2007 at the [[Moscow Millionaire Fair|Millionaire's Fair in Moscow]]. It was successful only until sometime in 2009. Trump attempted to create a reality show in St. Petersburg, starring a Russian athlete. However, this was not successful.&lt;ref name=Meagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belton /&gt;

==Trump's responses==
On January 10, 2017, BuzzFeed reported the existence of the [[Trump-Russia dossier]] (also called the Steele dossier), a series of reports prepared by a private intelligence source in Great Britain. The unverified dossier alleged various connections and collusion between Trump associates and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russia before and during]] the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="bensinger10january"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bensinger|first1=Ken|title=These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia|accessdate=May 29, 2017|work=BuzzFeed|date=January 10, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, January 11, Trump tweeted, "Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=realDonaldTrump |author-link=Donald Trump |number=819159806489591809 |title= Russia has never tried to use leverage over me.

On May 9, 2017, Trump's tax law firm, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, sent a letter to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], which said a review of Trump's tax returns for the past 10 years did not find income from Russian sources during that period, save for "a few exceptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/12/law-firm-russia-trump-morgan-lewis|title=Lawyers who said Trump has no ties to Russia named Russian law firm of 2016|first=Lauren|last=Gambino|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptions were the 2008 sale of a Trump-owned 6.26-acre estate in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], for $95 million to Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's former estate: The story behind the $95-million mansion tear-down |work=[[Palm Beach Daily News]] |date=April 3, 2016 |url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/business/real-estate/trump-former-estate-the-story-behind-the-million-mansion-tear-down/5qgtlikl46SX7KXGdtDPUI/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump and the mansion that no one wanted.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9141">A '''chief data officer''' ('''CDO''') is a [[corporate officer]] responsible for enterprise wide governance and utilization of information as an asset, via [[data processing]], analysis, [[data mining]], information trading and other means. CDOs report mainly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). Depending on the area of expertise this can vary. CDO is a member of the executive management team and manager of enterprise-wide data processing &amp; data mining.

==Role definition==

The Chief Data Officer title shares its abbreviation with the [[Chief Digital Officer]] but the two are not the same job. The Chief Data Officer has a significant measure of business responsibility for determining what kinds of information the enterprise will choose to capture, retain and exploit and for what purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigdataparis.com/presentation/mercredi/PDelort.pdf?PHPSESSID=tv7k70pcr3egpi2r6fi3qbjtj6#page=11&lt;/ref&gt; However, the similar-sounding [[Chief Digital Officer]] or [[Chief Digital Information Officer]] often does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible for the information ''systems'' through which data is stored and processed.

==History and evolution==

The role of manager for data processing was not elevated to that of senior management prior to the 1980s.  As organizations have recognized the importance of information technology as well as [[business intelligence]], [[data integration]], [[master data management]] and data processing to the fundamental functioning of everyday business, this role has become more visible and crucial. This role includes defining strategic priorities for the company in the area of data systems and opportunities, identifying new business opportunities pertaining to data, optimizing revenue generation through data, and generally representing data as a strategic business asset at the executive table.

With the rise in [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA), large-scale system integration, and heterogeneous data storage/exchange mechanisms ([[database]]s, [[XML]], [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]], etc.), it is necessary to have a high-level individual, who possesses a combination of business knowledge, technical skills, and people skills, guide data strategy. Besides the revenue opportunities, acquisition strategy, and customer data policies, the chief data officer is charged with explaining the strategic value of data and its important role as a business asset and revenue driver to executives, employees, and customers. This contrasts with the older view of data systems as mere [[Front and back ends|back-end]] IT systems.

More recently, with the adoption of [[data science]] the Chief Data Officer is sometimes looked upon as the key strategy person either reporting to the [[Chief Strategy Officer]] or serving the role of CSO in lieu of one. This person has the responsibility of measurement along various business lines and consequently defining the strategy for the next growth opportunities, product offerings, markets to pursue, competitors to look at etc.  This is seen in organizations like [[Chartis]], [[AllState]] and [[Fidelity]]

==Notable example CDOs==
* John Bottega was CDO for [[CitiGroup]]'s Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) unit, and later for the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/author-bio.asp?author_id=1470&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Philip Bourne]] is associate director for data science at the [[National Institutes of Health]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-names-dr-philip-e-bourne-first-associate-director-data-science|title=NIH Names Dr. Philip E.

* [[Usama Fayyad]] was the first CDO for [[Yahoo!]] in 2004-2009 and he is now CDO of [[Barclays]] in London since 2013—he showed how the role can generate value by creating a $500 million new revenue source based on behavioral Targeting of Ads for [[Yahoo!]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chiefdataofficereurope.com/speaker/usama-fayyad/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506072020/http://www.chiefdataofficereurope.com/speaker/usama-fayyad/ |archivedate=2016-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maria Villar was appointed CDO at Fannie Mae and Justin Magruder was appointed CDO at Freddie Mac in 2007, in the months leading up to the 2008 Credit Crisis to assist the GSE's in implementing new financial control frameworks for risk management. Beth Hiatt succeeded Maria and Diane Schmidt succeeded Justin in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/ir/pdf/proxy-statements/2007_annual_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henri Verdier was appointed in September 2014 Administrateur Général des Données (CDO) of the French Administration, probably the first CDO of a Country.&lt;ref&gt;ANDSI - The association of French CIOs http://www.andsi.fr/tag/henri-verdier/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zachary Townsend]] was appointed the inaugural CDO of [[California]] by [[Jerry Brown]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html|title=Inaugural Chief Data Officer Appointed in California|website=www.govtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role has wide authority around transparency, efficiency and accountability in state operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govfresh.com/2016/04/california-seeks-chief-data-officer/|title=California seeks chief data officer - GovFresh|date=13 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry and geographic trends in CDOs==

Many major Banks and Insurance companies, subsequent to the credit crisis of 2008, created the CDO role to ensure data quality and transparency for regulatory and [[risk management]] as well as analytic reporting.

Various branches of US Government have CDOs. The CDO role is far more common in the United States than elsewhere. However several European banks have a CDO.

==Professional skills and educational background in CDOs==
To better harness values of data, more and more organizations are establishing Chief Data Officer (CDO) position. The professional skills of CDOs are rather diverse because CDOs are expected to undertake a variety of roles in their companies including enterprise data architect, data quality and governance manager, business strategy leader, business regulation compliance officer, etc. CDO is an emerging research field, few studies have been done on CDO. This paper tries to profile what are the key professional skills and education background that current CDOs have by studying their resumes on LinkedIn using topic modeling technique. This work is a step forward towards understanding the roles of CDOs in organizations and what are the professional skills and experience they may need have in order to undertake their responsibilities of managing data and realizing its true values for their organizations.

A research team at University of Arkansas at Little Rock uses text mining and machine learning to analyze CDOs' resumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/AdvancesIS/Presentations/26/ 
 |title=Profiling Essential Professional Skills of Chief Data Officers Through Topic Modeling Algorithms
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the paper, on average each CDO has received two degrees. 
* 16.9% of them have a Ph.D. degree or doctoral degree;
*  62.2% have at least one master's degree.  
In terms of degree concentration, 
* 47.8% of them have a computer science, computer engineering, or information science degree; 
* 31.8% of them have a MBA degree; 
* 16.0% of them have a business, finance, or economics degree.

A '''condition subsequent''' is an event or state of affairs that brings an end to something else.  A condition subsequent is often used in a legal context as a marker bringing an end to one's legal rights or duties.  A condition subsequent may be either an event or a state of affairs that must either (1) occur or (2) fail to continue to occur.

==Examples==
A condition subsequent may be either an event or a state of affairs that must either (1) occur or (2) fail to continue to occur.

An example of the first, a condition that must occur to bring an end to something else:
*"When I run out of fuel, the fire will die down."

An example of the second, a condition that must fail to occur to bring an end to something else:
*"So long as I have fuel, the fire will continue."

In both cases, running out of fuel is a condition subsequent to the continuance of the fire.

==In law==
A condition subsequent is noted for its common use in the law.

===In contract law===
In [[contract law]]:&lt;br&gt;
A [[contract]] may be [[Frustration of purpose|frustrated]] on the occurrence of a condition subsequent: in a contract to provide a music hall for a musical performance, the burning down of the music hall may frustrate the contract and automatically bring it to an end. ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' 3 B. &amp; S. 826, 122 Eng. Rep. 309 (1863)

===In property law===
In [[property law]]:&lt;br&gt;

Main Article: [[Defeasible estate#Fee simple subject to condition subsequent|Fee simple subject to condition subsequent]]

A right in land may be cut off by a condition subsequent.  When land rights are subject to a condition subsequent, this creates a defeasable fee called a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

In such a fee, the future interest is called a "right of reentry" or "[[right of entry]]."
There, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition, but if the specified future event occurs, the grantor has a right to retake his property (as opposed to it reverting to him automatically).  Again, the right of entry is not automatic, but rather must be exercised to terminate the fee simple subject to condition subsequent. To exercise right of entry, the holder must take substantial steps to recover [[Possession (law)|possession]] and [[Title (property)|title]], for example, by filing a lawsuit. 

One of the languages used to create a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and a right of entry is "to A, but if A sells alcohol on the land, then grantor has the right of reentry."

Common uses include language such as "may", "but if", "however", or "provided that..."

==Compared to condition precedent==
In comparison, a condition subsequent brings a duty to an end whereas a [[condition precedent]] initiates a duty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5653">'''David Stewart Dawson''' (1849 – 6 August 1932), frequently referred to as '''Stewart Dawson''', was an [[Australia]]n manufacturing jeweller and property tycoon born in [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="Carters"&gt;[http://www.carters.com.au/index.cfm/index/5116-stewart-dawson-and-co-silver-and-precious-objects/ silver and precious objects - Stewart Dawson &amp; Co&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served his apprenticeship in [[Dufftown]]&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt; in [[Banffshire]] then founded a successful retail watchmaking and jewellery business in [[Liverpool]], England in 1871 after moving there age 22,&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt; with shops in most large cities in Great Britain, aided by the slogan "Who watches the Police?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16887586 ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 12 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; after winning a tender to supply watches for the Liverpool Police. Advertising in Australian newspapers brought so much business he decided to move there and emigrated in 1886. He founded the business of Stewart Dawson and Co. in [[Sydney]] and soon had branches in [[Melbourne]], and [[Auckland]] and [[Dunedin]] in [[New Zealand]] and [[Regent Street]] in London. After making the company a [[limited liability company]] in 1907, Dawson sold the company in 1931 to RHO Hills&lt;ref name="Carters"/&gt; [[department store]] (now [[House of Fraser]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c2682 HOUSE OF FRASER Archive :: Company: RHO Hills Ltd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting company operated until 'around 1935'.&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SilCltn"&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/electroplatesilverD.html English electroplate silver: marks and hallmarks of British silver plate: Da-Dh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He dealt extensively in inner-city real-estate, including some of the most significant transactions in Australian history. Anticipating the [[Great Depression]], he converted much of his property (valued around  £1,000,000) from ownership to rental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4467152 obituary ''The Argus'' 8 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; One significant property he owned was half of the [[Strand Arcade]] ([[Pitt Street]] end). This peculiar arrangement was to have far-reaching consequences as a result of piecemeal development and inconsistent maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/strand_arcade Strand Arcade&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was noted for his contribution to the [[First World War|war]] effort, and served on many committees.

He founded the Ambassadors Restaurant in 1923, long one of the most fashionable in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21979177 ''Brisbane Courier'' 8 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- His heirs included his wife Harriet Stewart Dawson, sons Percy Stewart Dawson (d. 1947), Norman Stewart Dawson (appointed Major, won VC, killed in car crash 1940) and Stuart Stewart Dawson, daughters Lila Arnold, Vanna Jerrard (not Gerrard) and Bertha Verral (not Verrai) and grand-daughter Joyce Verral. (The above references contain some typos). More details at http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16969689 Grandson David Stewart Dawson jr (son of Stuart) was subject of many news items inappropriate for Wikipedia --&gt;
He had a head office, 'The Treasure House' (built 1907) in [[Hatton Garden]], London and homes in [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] and [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach, Sydney]], a villa in [[Monte Carlo]] and a three-storey country mansion, "Bon Accord" in [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]] in the [[Greater Blue Mountains Area|Blue Mountains]], close to [[Norman Lindsay]]'s home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.carters.com.au/index.cfm/index/5116-stewart-dawson-and-co-silver-and-precious-objects/ |title= Stewart Dawson and Co: Silver and precious objects |publisher= Carters Antiques  = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On his death the Monte Carlo villa went to his widow, Harriet Stewart Dawson (née McNab) (1864–1945) who married Prince Michal Radziwill, "Ordynat" (entailed estate holder) of the Palace and estate of Antonin in Ostrow County, Poland (1870–1955) in 1938.&lt;ref&gt; Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia Probate Packet for the Estate of the late Princess Radziwill &lt;/ref&gt; "Bon Accord" was kept as a guest house by his heirs, managed by [[Hugh D.

Prior to launching The Hyperfactory, Handley founded a global online sports and racing betting business, Feverpitch. At the age of 22, Handley became New Zealand's youngest managing director&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_636672"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=636672 |title=Betting exchange offers investors a safer punt |author=Griffin, Peter |date=16 January 2002 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a listed company when he led Feverpitch to list on the venture-style 'New Capital Market' of the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]]. The company subsequently launched 'betting exchanges' around the world similar to the business [[Betfair]] but eventually floundered.

In 2003, Handley led a merger of several major players in the New Zealand childcare sector to form Kidicorp Group Limited, a large national operator which was listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidicorp.co.nz/ |title=BestStart Childcare Centres |publisher=Kidicorp.co.nz |date= |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handley is an active speaker in the entrepreneurship, marketing and digital industry, having spoken at events around the world including [[ad:tech]], [[Mobile Marketing Association]] Forums, OMMA, iMedia, [[Informa]], [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]], [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Mobile Entertainment Forum, iHollywood and [[Webstock]] and Better by Design in New Zealand.

In December 2011, Handley spent a year helping to create what is now [[The B Team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madisonalley.com/2012/12/10/derek-handley-joins-madison-alley-as-special-advisor/|title=Derek Handley, Mobile Marketing and Media Pioneer, Joins Madison Alley as Special Advisor &amp;#124; Madison Alley Global Ventures|author=|date=10 December 2012|publisher=Madisonalley.com|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit initiative formed by a global group of leaders to create a future where the purpose of business is to be a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit.

In 2013 Handley was named an Adjunct Executive Professor for AUT University in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2013/06/aut-appoints-derek-handley-executive-professor-role|title=AUT appoints Derek Handley to executive professor role|last=Matthews|first=Benjamin|date=4 June 2013|publisher=Idealog|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also released a book, ‘Heart to Start’, a memoir about the beginning of his own entrepreneurial journey aiming to become an entrepreneur who does business to have a positive impact on social or environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10885823|title=From near ruin to success – Derek Handley – Business – NZ Herald News|date=24 May 2013|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he joined the board of directors of publicly listed [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky Television New Zealand]], then one of the top 200 public companies on the Australian Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11124265|title=Handley joins Sky TV board – Business – NZ Herald News|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Handley founded Aera VC, a network of family funds investing in start-ups trying to tackle social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11741534|title=Kiwi Derek Handley backs 'social' start-ups|last=Fletcher|first=Hamish|date=4 November 2016|access-date=14 December 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fastcoexist.com/3065581/this-activist-vc-firm-will-help-american-social-entrepreneurs-move-to-new-zealand|title=This Activist VC Firm Will Help American Social Entrepreneurs Move To New Zealand|last=Peters|first=Adele|date=16 November 2016|access-date=14 December 2016|publisher=Fast Co Exist|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/sirius/dollars-change-interviews-aeravc-founder-derek-handley/|title=Dollars and Change interviews AeraVC founder Derek Handley|date=2 November 2016|publisher=Wharton University of Pennsylvania, Social Impact|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chief Technology Officer ===
Handley applied for the role of the New Zealand Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The role was being created under the auspices of Government Digital Services Minister [[Clare Curran]]. On 24 August 2018, New Zealand Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] dismissed Curran from the [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] after it became clear Curran had met Handley in February at her [[Beehive (New Zealand)|Beehive]] office to discuss his interest in the vacant CTO role. Curran had failed to disclose the meeting in her ministerial diary and to inform staff or officials about it (the second meeting she had failed to disclose). Curran apologised to the Prime Minister for her actions and eventually resigned as a Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/jacinda-ardern-sacks-clare-curran-cabinet-removes-her-two-portfolios-after-second-failure-declare-meeting|title=Jacinda Ardern sacks Clare Curran from Cabinet, removes her from two portfolios after second failure to declare a meeting|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|publisher=[[1 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/08/prime-minister-removes-clare-curran-from-cabinet.html|title=Prime Minister removes Clare Curran from Cabinet|last1=Hurley|first1=Emma|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Newshub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12112984|title=Clare Curran sacked from Cabinet, PM Jacinda Ardern announces|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/107080064/derek-handley-receives-compensation-after-being-dumped-as-chief-technology-officer.html|title=Derek Handley receives $107k in compensation after being dumped as chief technology officer|last=Pullar-Strecker|first=Tom|date=14 September 2018|website=Stuff|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Handley announced that he had been offered, and had accepted, the CTO role in August.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-new-zealand-cto-derek-handley/|title=The Role of New Zealand CTO|last=Hadnley|first=Derek|date=14 September 2018|website=www.linkedin.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Government announced that it would not be proceeding with the role in its current form, and paid Handley compensation of $107,000 (three months' pay plus reimbursement for moving costs). At the time of the announcement the Minister for Government Digital Services [[Megan Woods]] said: "This decision in no way reflects on him as a candidate and the State Services Commission review shows that the process was suitably robust".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Handley said he was "deeply disappointed" by the process but the Government's decision to halt it was understandable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In November 2017 he was granted New Zealand citizenship by Minister for Internal Affairs Tracey Martin under the 'exceptional circumstances' provision. The exceptional circumstances provision was required because he had not spent enough time in New Zealand to meet the usual requirements to become a New Zealand citizen (865 days short). He suggested that he didn't meet the requirements because he frequently travelled for business reasons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He has purchased a ticket on [[Richard Branson]]’s [[Virgin Galactic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-05-20/tech/29974798_1_napoleon-entrepreneurship-three-things]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425203730/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-05-20/tech/29974798_1_napoleon-entrepreneurship-three-things|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5704">'''Didier Bellens''' (9 June 1955 – 28 February 2016) was a Belgian businessman. Until 15 November 2013, he was the [[CEO]] of [[Belgacom]], the leading telecommunications company of Belgium. He was married and had three children. He died on 28 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160228_02154022|title=Oud-topman Belgacom Didier Bellens overleden|author=edm|work=De Standaard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bellens graduated in 1978 as a commercial engineer at the [[Solvay Business School]] of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] ([[Brussels]]).

==Career==
Bellens started his career in 1978 as an [[auditor]] at [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells]]. During his time at Deloitte he was engaged on the audits of the Belgian subsidiary of [[General Motors]]. In 1981 he became financial director of the [[Groupe Bruxelles Lambert|Compagnie Brussel Lambert]] [[holding company|holding]] (GBL). He managed the investment portfolio and prospects potential investments. He became Deputy Manager of the [[Pargesa Holding S.A.|Pargesa Holding]] in [[Geneva]] in 1985, where he was responsible for the management of holdings, mergers and acquisitions. Didier Bellens manages the participations of the GBL group in the company.

In 1992 Didier Bellens came back to the [[Groupe Bruxelles Lambert]] as Managing Director, taking charge of the group's strategic participations in companies such as [[Royale Belge]], the BBL, and the CLT. He played an instrumental role in the merger between AXA and Royale Belge, and the change and the negotiations leading to the [[merger]] between CLT (''Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion'') and UFA. He also participated in the exchange of shares between RTL and [[Bertelsmann]], which gives RTL a minority participation in Bertelsmann, and the change of ownership of the BBL.  He joined the RTL Group in 2001, which is created through the merger of CTL-UFA and [[FremantleMedia|Pearson Television]] (now FremantleMedia), as its CEO, where he focused on the group's international expansion. He concluded the merger with Pearson Television and launched the RTL Group on the stock market.

In March 2003, Didier Bellens was appointed Belgacom's President and Chief Executive Officer as the successor to [[John J. Goossens]]. In March 2009 his mandate at Belgacom was renewed in March for a six-year term. His position at the head of Belgacom almost ended in 2011 after a strong dispute with the company board and the Belgian federal minister for Civil Service and Public Enterprises, [[Inge Vervotte]]. After a few incidents (accusation of conflict of interest, derogatory comments about the government, alleged covert promotion of confidante) the government decided in 2013 the relationship of trust was seriously damaged and Didier Bellens' position was no longer justifiable. He was dismissed on the basis of serious professional misconduct.

==Other activities==
Bellens was a member of the Board of Directors of Belgacom ICS, the Telindus Group, Proximus, Scarlet SA, and Tango. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of AXA Belgium, VOKA (the Flemish Chamber of Commerce and Industry) and was on the steering committee of the FEB (Federation of Commerce in Belgium). In addition, he served as independent Chairman of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, and as independent Director of the Board of Directors of the Compagnie Immobilière de Belgique. He was also advisor to CV Capital Partners and member of the International Advisory Council of the New York Stock Exchange.

He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Erasmus Foundation and the ULB Foundation, and served as Vice Chairman of the Solvay Business School's Consultative Council.

In April 2016, Bellens was named in the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demorgen.be/buitenland/ook-naam-van-didier-bellens-duikt-op-in-panamapapers-b6c6e99f|title=Panama Papers: "Bellens was bestuurder op vraag van vriend"|work=De Morgen|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique Jacobo Emilio Zóbel-Roxas y Olgado''' (January 7, 1927&amp;ndash;May 17, 2004), better known as '''Enrique J. Zóbel''' and '''EZ''', was a prominent [[Filipino people|Filipino]] businessman and [[polo]] player.

==Early life==

The only child of Col. Jacobo Zóbel y Roxas and Ángela Olgado, he was a grandson and namesake of [[Enrique_Zobel_de_Ayala|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]].

After the Japanese forces entered [[Manila]] in 1941,  the 14-year-old Enrique displayed his resourcefulness and audacity, having to care for his mother while his father was with the [[USAFFE]] forces in [[Bataan]]. To generate income for their daily needs, he used his father's [[polo pony|polo ponies]] to offer [[kalesa]] rides and even befriended General Ota, the head of the [[Kempeitai]] in the process.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.inquirer.net/current/may-2010-elections/&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the favorite of his aunt, Doña Mercedes Zobel McMicking (matriarch of the [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala family]] after the deaths of her brothers, Jacobo and Alfonso), and her husband, Col. Joseph McMicking. The couple took interest in his education and growth and groomed him, together with other clan members for the family businesses.

==Career==

Zóbel joined Ayala y Compañia in 1955 and worked closely with his uncle, Col. McMicking, who was credited for engineering the transformation of Makati from vast tracts of swamplands into the Philippines' premier financial and commercial district. When the Ayala y Compañia partnership became a [[Ayala Corporation|corporation]] in 1967 (after the retirement of Col. McMicking), Zóbel became its first chief executive. Like McMicking, Zóbel showed great strength and business savvy in contributing to the growth of Ayala as one of the Philippines' biggest and most respected conglomerates. He sustained McMicking’s vision for the Ayala group. He professionalized the Ayala group and was instrumental in fulfilling Ayala’s goal to become a major player in the banking sector, as the company gained control of the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]. Ayala also moved into new industries - [[semiconductor]] ([[Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc.]]), [[food processing]] (Pure Foods Corporation - now, [[San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc.]]), [[agribusiness]] (Ayala Agricultural Development Corporation) and [[telecommunications]] (Globe-Mackay Cable &amp; Radio Corporation - now, [[Globe Telecom]]). In 1973, Zóbel welcomed the [[Mitsubishi]] group as partners and took Ayala Corporation [[IPO|public]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111172325/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1976, Ayala Corporation was listed in the Makati Stock Exchange (now [[Philippine Stock Exchange]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayala.com.ph/governance_organization_shareholder_info.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, he founded the [[Makati Business Club]] (MBC) to support or oppose policies which affected national life. He felt that the business community needed to speak out as a single solid voice and  not lobby for its own corporate or sectoral interest.  From 1983 to 1986, MBC would be the prime advocate of [[EDSA_revolution|political change]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbc.com.ph/the-mbc/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he fought with his third cousin [[Andres Soriano Jr.|Andrés Soriano, Jr.]] for control of [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC). After losing the battle for control, he sold the Zóbel de Ayala family's shares (equivalent to 19% of SMC) in SMC to [[Danding Cojuangco|Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/97/1212/biz2.html&lt;/ref&gt; His controversial move was met with the displeasure of his aunt, Doña Mercedes, and cost him his position at Ayala. He was succeeded by his first cousin [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Zóbel de Ayala]] in 1984.

On his own, he took on projects of unprecedented dimensions in 1984, building the [[Istana Nurul Iman]] (official residence of the [[Sultan of Brunei]], [[Hassanal Bolkiah]]) at a total cost of around $1.4 Billion USD under his company, Ayala International, Inc.

==Philanthropy==

The [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School|De La Salle-Santiago Zóbel School]] located in [[Ayala Alabang Village]] (an Ayala real estate development) was named in memory of son, Jacobo Santiago "Santi" (1954-1965), who died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 11.

In 1990, he established the Enrique Zóbel Foundation, which focuses on social and economic development projects in [[Calatagan]], [[Batangas]].

==Later life==

On May 10, 1991, Zóbel suffered a spinal injury and was paralyzed from the waist down after an accident in [[Sotogrande]], [[Spain]] while playing [[polo]]. He had to stop all physical activities and instead devoted his time to his foundation.

He was a recipient of the [[TOFIL Award]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tofil.ph/awardee_profile.php?id=70&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a consummate pilot and was equally at home with jets and propeller [[airplane]]s. Even just before his death, he was looking for a small jet that could fly the distance from Manila to Hawaii, where he had a vacation home.

==Personal life==

He was first married to [[Rocio Urquijo]] with whom he had three children - Jacobo Santiago "Santi" (1954-1965), Mercedes and Iñigo. He later separated from Urquijo and married Dee Anne Hora, an American. After his death, Hora became the chairwoman of the Enrique Zobel Foundation and continues his good works.

He was also known by his employees as a fluent Tagalog speaker with a twist of Batangueno accent given his sojourn in Batangas. 

==Death==

Zóbel died on May 17, 2004 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/headlines/250442/enrique-zobel-ayala-founder-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/be/be002837.htm Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous==

Zóbel was an avid [[polo]] player and was the first Filipino president of Manila Polo Club (1963-1964).  In honor of his memory, the East Polo Field of the club was renamed Enrique Zóbel Field on January 9, 2005. The Enrique Zóbel Memorial Polo Cup was launched on January 30, 2005 at the club and has been held annually since.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20060317&amp;id=ylM1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=943,13725142&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europatat''', or '''European Potato Trade Association''', is a [[trade association]] of [[Europe]]an national associations and companies involved in the trade of seed [[potato]]es and ware potatoes. Europatat was established in 1952 and is located in [[Brussels]].

== History ==
Europatat was established on 12 January 1952 under the name ''European Union for the Wholesale Trade in Potatoes'' in [[Paris]]. Its first members were Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.potatopro.com/news/2012/europatat-european-potato-trade-association-celebrates-60th-anniversary|title=Europatat, the European potato trade association celebrates 60th anniversary|website=Potatopro.com|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Raquel Izquierdo de Santiago replaced Frédéric Rosseneu as Secretary general of Europata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.potatopro.com/news/2014/europatat-appoints-raquel-izquierdo-de-santiago-new-secretary-general|title=Europatat appoints Raquel Izquierdo de Santiago as new Secretary General|website=Potatopro.com|date=29 September 2014|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">The '''European Economic Senate (EES)''' is a neutral and independent body of enterprises and individuals that represent European business interests. The EES with its national sections in six EU-countries was founded in 2003. EES-President is the former Vice-President of the [[European Parliament]], German conservative politician Dr. [[Ingo Friedrich]].

== Members ==

Currently, 162 companies and economic leaders form the EES. Among these socalled Senators are the CEO of [[Deutsche Bahn AG]], [[Rüdiger Grube]], the [[Prime Minister]] of [[Luxembourg]] and President of the [[Euro Group]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], and [[Roland Koch]], former German head of government of [[Hesse]] and now CEO of [[Bilfinger Berger]].

National sections have been founded in middle and eastern European countries: in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Slovakia]]. With 49 Senators, [[Germany]] represents the biggest national EES-section.

EES-President Dr. [[Ingo Friedrich]] was a long-time [[Member of the European Parliament]] (1979-2009). From July 2004 to January 2007, he was one of the 14 Vice-Presidents of the [[European Parliament]]. In 2007, he was elected one of its 6 [[Quaestors]]. Secretary-General of the European Economic Senate is Wolfgang Franken, Michael Jäger is Chief Executive Officer.

== Guidelines ==

The EES represents the interests of its members in [[Europe]]. "We have the courage, the obligation and the confidence to create a ‘culture of responsibility and trust’. Our dialogues with the politicians and society are less emotional. We campaign against the organised lack of responsibility in almost all areas, and to work with our partners in assuming responsibilities for the economic and social interests of the businesses we represent", states the Secretary-General Wolfgang Franken regarding the EES-guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu-wirtschaftssenat.eu/english/Alias_Kopie_von_sort1.html Secretary-General Wolfgang Franken about the EES-guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; The EES deals with current issues such as the German nuclear pullout,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu-wirtschaftssenat.eu/english/nuclear-pullout-has-to-be-linked-to-a-wider-eu-energy-policy-framework.html EES President Ingo Friedrich about the German nuclear pullout, 26 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; the Euro-crisis&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu-wirtschaftssenat.eu/english/368.html „Europe’s strength must be used“ by EES Secretary General Wolfgang Franken, 20 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and the debt crisis in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu-wirtschaftssenat.eu/english/stumbling-block-in-greece--touchstone-for-europe.html EES President Ingo Friedrich about the debt-crisis in Greece, 18 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12531">The '''Evaporating Cloud''' is one of the six [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] in the [[Theory of Constraints]]. The Evaporating Cloud (EC) - also referred to in the literature as "the cloud", or as a "conflict resolution diagram"&lt;ref&gt;Dettmer, H,W. 1999. The conflict resolution diagram: Creating win-win solutions, Quality Progress,32(3):41&lt;/ref&gt; - is a logical diagram representing a problem that has no obvious satisfactory solution.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;Fedurko, Jelena. Behind the cloud: Enhancing logical thinking. TOC Strategic Solutions Ltd (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- need peer-reviewed examples/refs. This is internally published. --&gt;

== Overview ==
The most commonly used of the TOC tools,{{refn|group=note|name=note0|The EC is reported to be used in 77% of TOC case-studies, according to one report.&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;Kim, Seonmin, Victoria Jane Mabin, and John Davies. "The theory of constraints thinking processes: retrospect and prospect." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 28.2 (2008): 155-184.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the EC was designed to address conﬂict or [[dilemma]] situations (trade-off situations where there is no acceptable compromise) by diagramming the logic behind the conflict and methodically examining the assumptions behind the logic.
&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC has a set format with five boxes, labelled A, B, C, D, D’, that are usually laid out as follows:&lt;ref name=mabin2001&gt;Victoria J. Mabin, Steve Forgeson and Lawrence Green. Harnessing resistance: using the theory of constraints to assist change management. Journal of European Industrial Training. 25/2/3/4 [2001] 168±191&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Evaporating Cloud - Overview.svg|thumb|280px|The generic structure of an Evaporating Cloud diagram.]]

    [B] ← [D ]                      [A]
   /       ↑                       /   \
 [A]       conflict      OR      [B]   [C]
   \       ↓                      ↑     ↑
    [C] ← [D’]                   [D] ↔ [D’]

The boxes represent two opposing ''wants'' that represent the conflict (D, D’){{refn|group=note|The conflict can take the form of either "do this vs don't do this", or "do action 1 vs do action 2" where both actions can't be done at once.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=10}} }}, the ''needs'' that each want is trying to satisfy (B, C), and a common ''objective'' or goal (A) that both needs are trying to fulfil.{{refn|group=note|For example, a cloud based on an airlines case study&lt;ref name=polito2006&gt;Polito, Tony, Kevin Watson, and Robert J. Vokurka. "Using the theory of constraints to improve competitiveness: an airline case study." Competitiveness Review: An International Business Journal incorporating Journal of Global Competitiveness 16.1 (2006): 44-50.&lt;/ref&gt; has the conflict (D vs D’) stated as "minimize service costs" vs "do not minimize service costs." The needs (B, C) are stated respectively as "have the least cost" and "have superior service", with the common objective (A) being to "provide quality".}}

The lines or arrows connecting the nodes represent the rationale or causal assumptions that are used to link the nodes. When communicating the cloud, the arrows should be read as “in order to” or “because” or “so that”. For example: ''“In order to achieve '''A''' we require '''B''' because there is no way we can have '''A''' without '''B'''.”'' Or: ''“There is no way we can have '''D''' and have '''D’''' ''(read as "D-prime")'' at the same time.”''

== Origin of Name ==
According to Scheinkopf (2002) the Evaporating Cloud is so named in honor of [[Richard Bach]]. In Bach's 1977 book ''[[Illusions_(Bach_novel)|Illusions]]'', the main characters remove storm clouds from the sky by thinking them away.
:''If you really want to remove a cloud from your life, you do not make a big production out of it, you just relax and remove it from your thinking. That’s all there is to it.''&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Richard, Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah. Dell Publishing, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Evaporating Cloud tool is intended to similarly "vapourize" difficult problems by resolving an underlying conflict.
:''[Goldratt teaches] that every problem is a conﬂict, and that conﬂicts arise because we create them by believing at least one erroneous assumption. Thus, simply by thinking about the assumptions that enforce the existence of a conﬂict, we should be able to resolve any conﬂict by evaporating it with the power of our thinking.''&lt;ref&gt;Scheinkopf, Lisa J. Thinking for a change: Putting the TOC thinking processes to use. CRC Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps in problem solving ==
The general process for applying an EC to problem solving is described by Cohen (2010) as follows:&lt;ref name="handbook24"&gt;James F. Cox III, Ph.D, CFPIM, CIRM; John G. Schleier, Jr.: Theory of Constraints Handbook. Daily Management with TOC, Chapter (McGraw-Hill Professional, 2010), AccessEngineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=676}}
# Identify the type of problem (there are variations in the way the diagrams are constructed for different types of problems.)
# Write a storyline of this problem in a factual, objective way, even if the problem causes an emotional upset.
# Build the Cloud (see example guides below).
# Check the logical statements of the Cloud and make necessary corrections and upgrades.
# Surface the assumptions behind the logical connections to find the one that is supporting the conflict.{{refn|group=note|Usually the best connections to examine are the ones between C-D′ or B-D. While addressing the D-D′ connection is ideal, it is not usually feasible.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=681-684}} }}
# Construct your solution and check it for win-win.
# Communicate the solution to the people involved in dealing with the problem.

Clouds are "built" by filling in the appropriate boxes with statements about the situation. Both the wording of the statements and the sequence of filling the boxes can be important. Below is a guide to the recommended sequence and questions for building ''Day-to-day Conflict'' or ''Inner Dilemma'' clouds.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=679, 689}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Box !! Guiding questions
|-
| D || What action does the other side want to do/do I feel under pressure to do?
|-
| D′ || What is the action I ''want'' to do?
|-
| C || What need is satisfied by my action in D′?
|-
| B || What need is satisfied by their/my action in D?
|-
| A || What common objective will be achieved by meeting both need B and need C?
|}

Different types of problems have slightly different requirements when it comes to documenting and communicating the underlying conflict. Below is a summary of different types of problems, and the suggested sequence for building and communicating the cloud.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|page=711}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Cloud  !! Sequence to Build !! Sequence to Communicate
|-

|-
| Day-to-Day Conflict || D-D′-C-B-A || A-B-D A-C-D′
|-
| Fire-Fighting || B-D-D′-C-A || A-B-D A-C-D′{{refn|group=note|name=note1|The given sequence assumes that C-D′ represents your side (or your favorite side), which should be communicated last.&lt;ref name=handbook24&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}
|-
| UDE || B-D-C-D′-A || A-B-D A-C-D′{{refn|group=note|name=note1}}
|-
| Generic Cloud || A-B-C-D-D′ || A-B-D A-C-D′{{refn|group=note|The given sequence assumes that C-D′ represents the side least likely to be defensive. This side of the conflict should be communicated last.&lt;ref name=handbook24&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}
|}

== Example ==
Goldratt has illustrated the use of the evaporating cloud technique in a discussion of the [[Economic production quantity]] model.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990&gt;E.M. Goldratt. What is this thing called the Theory of Constraints and how is it implemented? North River Press: Crofton-on-Hudson NY, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=43}} The prerequisite wants are to ''run large batches'' (D) and yet to ''run small batches'' (D’). These are clearly in conflict. The required need that D is trying to meet is to ''reduce setup cost'' (B), whereas the D’ prerequisite needs to ''reduce carrying cost per unit'' (C). Both requirements are aimed at the objective (A): to ''reduce cost per unit''.

[[Image:Evaporating Cloud Example.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|EC example illustrating the problem of the Economic Batch Quantity.]]
Fedurko (2011) recommends checking the logic of the EC by reading the logical statements aloud, in the following sequence:&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|pages=13, 22}}
#In order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run ''large'' batches.
#in order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce carrying cost per unit we must run ''small'' batches.
#Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict.
#Running ''large'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#Running ''small'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.

According to Fedurko,
:''Reading aloud ... is needed because it explicitly employs the auditory channel as an additional mechanism to process and check the logic.''&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|page=13}}

Goldratt claims that each of the logical connections in the EC represent an (often hidden) assumption.
:''One of the most basic fundamentals of logic is, that behind any logical connection there is an assumption.''&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|page=47}}

The assumptions behind the above connections can be surfaced by again reading the statements with a "because" clause added.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011/&gt;{{rp|page=31}} For example, Goldratt surfaces the following assumptions behind the 2nd statement in the example EC:
*In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run large batches, ''because''
*#setup cost is fixed and can't be reduced.
*#the machine being set up is a bottleneck with no spare capacity.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=48-50}}
And again, with the 5th statement:
*Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict, ''because'':
*#large is the opposite of small.
*#there is only one meaning to the word "batch".&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=50-51}}

The second assumption is challenged by distinguishing between ''production batch'' size (between setups) and ''transfer batch'' size (between workstations), and so allowing different sized batches for different purposes.

== Core Conflict Cloud ==
The '''Core Conflict Cloud''' is an Evaporating Cloud that emerges from analysis of a [[current reality tree (Theory of constraints)|current reality tree]] (CRT), which is one of the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]]. The CRT provides a way for analyzing many system or organizational problems at once, treating them as symptoms of a single core problem.
If an easy solution to such a core problem has not already been implemented, it is likely there is some conflict in the organization that is blocking implementation.&lt;ref name=tocma&gt;
{{cite book |author=Eric Noreen|author2=Debra Smith|author3=James T. Mackey |title=The ''Theory of Constraints'' and its implications for Management Accounting |publisher=North River Press |year=1995 |pages=165 |isbn=0-88427-116-1 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Core Conflict Cloud is to address this inherent conflict that is preventing the sorting out of the core problem.&lt;ref name=handbook24/&gt;{{rp|page=710}}

'''''Figyelő''''' (''{{lang-en|Observer}}'') is a [[Christian democracy|christian-conservative]] [[Hungary|Hungarian]] business magazine published on every Thursday by the Hungarian publishing company K4A Lapkiadó (owned by [[Mária Schmidt]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://atlatszo.hu/2017/05/18/impulziv-eroszakos-orditozos-hatalomatvetel-igy-szerezte-meg-schmidt-maria-cege-a-figyelot/ Ordítozva állította a propagandagépezet szolgálatába Schmidt Mária a Figyelőt - May 18, 2017 - Antónia Rádi – Katalin Erdélyi - atlatszo.hu]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Figyelő'' covers a broad range of subjects, such as politics, business, economy, society, technology, and to some extent culture, its approach being economy- or business-related wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20170407-megujult-a-figyelo.html Teljesen megújult a Figyelő - Tamás Lánczi - April 7, 2017 - origo.hu]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that since the acquisition by K4A Lapkiadó in December 2016 the magazine has actively started to lean heavily in the favour of the policies of [[Viktor Orbán]], for example, in April 2018 it published a list of 200 people claimed to be 'mercenaries' funded by [[George Soros]] to topple the [[Government of Hungary|Hungarian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-victor-orban-magazine-list-journalists-refugee-george-soros-mercenaries-a8301806.html|title=Hungarian magazine publish lists of journalists and refugee advocates among 'mercenaries of Soros'|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/poland-polarization/568324/|title=A Warning From Europe: The Worst Is Yet to Come|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/04/12/alarm-in-hungary-over-intimidatory-list-of-soros-mercenaries-|title=Alarm in Hungary over 'intimidatory' list of ‘Soros mercenaries’|date=2018-04-12|work=euronews|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Figyelő'' was launched in 1957. It has started and covered several infamous stories of Hungarian politics, notably, the "Tocsik-case" in 1996, a corruption scandal related to the then-socialist-liberal government coalition of Hungary. The case was revealed following an article of ''Figyelő'', and later swelled into one of the greatest scandals of the history of post-[[Cold War]] Hungary. At the end of the 1990s the magazine was among the independent and investigative publications in Hungary.&lt;ref name=rita99&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Rita M. Csapo-Sweet| author2=Ildiko Kaposi| title=Mass Media in Post-Communist Hungary| journal=International Communications Bulletin| date=Spring 1999| volume=34| issue=1-2| url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~hasegawa/aejmc-icd/spring99/mediainhungary.html| accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the weekly was owned by the Dutch company [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen|VNU]].&lt;ref name=rita99/&gt; Some years later, in 2003, ''Figyelő'' revealed a huge banking scandal, in which politicians and well-known businessmen were involved. ''Figyelő'' received the Hungarian Pulitzer Memorial Award in 2006, and recently its journalists got some other prestigious awards, such as the Prize of Qualitative Journalism.

The publisher of ''Figyelő'' is Media City, and its [[editor-in-chief]] is Gábor Lambert. The senior editorial staff of the magazine include Melinda Kamasz (deputy editor-in-chief) and  László Sas ([[Copy editing|copy editor]]). ''Figyelő'''s sections are headed by Gergely Brückner (finance, investment), Ágnes Lilla Kovács (society, style), István Váczi (companies, markets, management, small enterprises), György Dózsa ([[Macroeconomics|macroeconomy]]), Zoltán Baka F. (monitor), Gábor Halaska ([[Information technology|IT]]), and Péter Bucsky (science).

According to the Hungarian Circulation Audit Association (Magyar Terjesztésellenőrzési Szövetség, MATESZ) ''Figyelő'' sold an average of 10,086 copies in the first quarter of 2012, which gives the weekly a solid position in the market of Hungarian weekly publications.&lt;ref&gt;[Matesz]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Figyelő'' has an online version. Its brand name is also used for the quarterly, thematic publication ''Figyelő Trend'' that covers some major market fields each year. The yearly publication ''Figyelő Top 200'' contains listings, details and figures concerning the 200 biggest companies of the Hungarian economy. The publisher also arranges professional conferences under ''Figyelő'''s name. Figyelő Top 200 awards are handed over on Gala nights called Figyelő Top 200 Gála, (arranged in the mid of October each year), with the participation of top dogs of the Hungarian economy.

In a contribution published in Entrepreneur Magazine in August 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298754|title=Entrepreneurship is the Key for MENA region|accessdate= 15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, he analysed the measures that should governments in the MENA region put in place to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Among the main actions that need to be taken, there are a better access to financing through government guarantees to banks, co-investments between the private and public sectors, tax incentives for start-ups, better access to education, laws to protect against bankruptcy and a stronger role for women.

==Cultural dialogue==
Nasrawin is involved in cultural dialogues between Europe, Africa and the Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpifinancial.net/flipbooks/BA/2013/Jun/#38|title=Dubai the bridge to Africa|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview on French TV in 2015, he mentioned that Arab countries must focus more on communication and mainly on helping the rest of the countries to understand their culture, which would contribute not only to peace but also to strengthen business relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR6Zdixu4tQ|title=Houssam Nasrawin sur TV5|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The university was granted a charter by the government of [[Pakistan]] in March 1985. The LUMS Board of Trustees comprises members of the domestic business community, academics and government representatives. The principal functions of the board are to set policy guidelines and to review the operations of the university. The Board of Governors, as the sponsor of LUMS, raises funds for the university's operation and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originpakistan.com/careers/viewtopic.php?f=189&amp;p=294{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, a business school by the name of Lahore Business School was established for an MBA Programme. Later the school was renamed and is known as Suleman Dawood Business School.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070324/saturday/main1.htm |title=The Tribune&amp;nbsp;– Magazine section&amp;nbsp;– Saturday Extra |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the construction of the current campus, LUMS started undergraduate programmes in Economics and Computer Sciences in 1994. In 1996, the School of Arts and Science was introduced to oversee the undergraduate programmes.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com" /&gt; LUMS established the School of Humanities, Social Sciences and Law to oversee the Social Sciences, Economics and Law departments. The School of Sciences and Engineering, for the disciplines of Mathematics, Computer Science and Computer Engineering, was established in 2008.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com" /&gt; As of 2016, the university charges Rs. 272,400 tuition fee per semester for undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1144509/university-asked-withdraw-fee-hike/|title=LUMS asked to withdraw 10% fee hike - The Express Tribune|date=2016-07-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LUMS launched the [[National Outreach Programme (LUMS)|National Outreach Programme]] (NOP) in 2011&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com" /&gt; to reach out to bright students from underprivileged areas of Pakistan. Under this initiative, induction of selected candidates into the academic programs will be facilitated by preparation for the University's admission criteria and then by a provision of full financial assistance to those who qualify. Many students are admitted to LUMS on the basis of NOP. There are also a number of scholarships which are offered on need/academic achievement basis. LUMS loan scheme covers 20%-100% of the tuition fee component of the student. LUMS loans are interest-free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lums.edu.pk/financial_assistance/overview.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413145938/http://lums.edu.pk/financial_assistance/overview.php|date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LUMS, it has disbursed PKR 3.2 Billion in financial assistance, with approximately 30% of the student body receiving some form of financial assistance each year. During the academic year 2015-16 alone, LUMS has disbursed more than PKR 500 Million as financial aid to its students. As of 2016, more than 800 scholars have benefited from the LUMS National Outreach Programme (NOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lums.edu.pk/news/general-news/shahid-hussain-foundation-establishes-scholarships-international-students|title=SHAHID HUSSAIN FOUNDATION ESTABLISHES SCHOLARSHIPS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Shahid Hussain Foundation established scholarships for international undergraduate students from [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lums.edu.pk/news/general-news/shahid-hussain-foundation-establishes-scholarships-international-students|title=Shahid Hussain Foundation Establishes Scholarships for International Students|date=2017-01-06|newspaper=LUMS|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; LUMS also offers a variety of scholarships to MBA students such as SAARC scholarship, MCB interest-free loans. &lt;ref&gt;lums.edu.pk/news/general-news/lums-mba-best-educational-experience-full-scholarships&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only institute in Pakistan offering the Asian Development Bank-Japan Scholarship Program (ADB-JSP)&lt;ref&gt;lums.edu.pk/news/general-news/asian-development-bank-japan-scholarships-lums&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, '''Issachar Bärmann''' by name (died August 23, 1675), was the son of the [[Talmud]]ic scholar '''Isaac Cohen of Borkum'''; and the name "''Behrends''" was adopted by ''Liepmann'' in honor of his father. His first wife, Jente (died 1695), was a daughter of Joseph Hameln, president of the congregation; his second, Feile (died 1727), a daughter of Judah Selkele Dilmann. Liepmann had the following children by his first marriage: Naphtali Hirz (died 1709), who became president of the congregation; Moses Jacob (died 1697), praised as a Talmudic scholar and philanthropist; Gumpert and Isaac, who, in 1721, were accused of an attempt at fraudulent bankruptcy, in consequence of which they were compelled to leave Hanover (1726). Behrend's daughter Genendel became the wife of the chief [[rabbi]] of [[Prague]], [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]]. She died at Hanover June 13, 1712.

Behrend's services as president of the congregation, in his endeavors to preserve the congregational cemetery, and to secure a special rabbinate and other privileges for Hanover, were valuable in the extreme. In 1683 Duke Rudolph August appointed him chief supervisor of the bleacheries of his community in the Harz. He stood in close relation to a number of princes, assisted Talmudic scholars, and established a "bet ha-midrash" in his own house. The library of his son-in-law David Oppenheimer, which he had himself enlarged, and which his son-in-law, owing to the censorship and other reasons, did not wish to keep at Prague, was removed by Behrends to Hanover, thus enabling the pastor Johann Christian Wolf of Hamburg to avail himself of it in preparing the ''Bibliotheca Hebræa''. Together with his son Naphtali Hirz, Liepmann in 1703 had a new [[synagogue]] erected upon the site of the old one, which, constructed by order of the duke of Hanover in 1609, had been torn down four years after its erection. The fate of Liepmann's two sons Gumbert and Isaac is related in a family "megillah", published by Jost in the second volume of the ''Jahrbuch für die Geschichte der Juden''.

[[File:AACSB Accredited.svg|thumbnail|Logo of accredited schools]]
There are 182 schools that hold the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business's]] (AACSB) [[Accounting]] [[Accreditation]]. The AACSB accredits [[business school]]s by evaluating critical areas of each school to ensure that it provides top-quality education,&lt;ref name="AACSB Accreditation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/aacsb.asp|publisher=AACSB International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and schools can apply for the [[accounting]] accreditation, which focusses on the schools' accounting programs, in addition to business accreditation.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/|publisher=AACSB International|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation is gained and maintained via a peer-review system, and schools are assessed in the context of their respective missions rather than against a fixed standard.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=B-School Accrediting Body Retools Standards|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323820304578411071717286236|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To apply for accounting accreditation, a school is required either to already hold the business accreditation, or to apply for both the business and accounting accreditations at the same time.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt;

The initial accounting accreditation process starts with the submission of an eligibility application, and includes self-evaluations and peer reviews.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt; The business school and the accounting academic unit are evaluated on their alignment with the AACSB's accreditation standards; under the standard for accounting accreditation, an accounting academic unit is evaluated based on its mission, intellectual contributions, and financial strategies for achieving its mission. For example, one of the bases of evaluation is whether the academic unit has produced intellectual contributions that have affected [[accounting]], [[business]] and [[management]] "in ways that are consistent with the mission, expected outcomes, and strategies of the unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation Standards for Accounting Accreditation |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108093650/http://aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the accounting accreditation is extended via 5-year review cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook For Joint Business And Accounting Continuous Improvement Reviews |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175301/http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the AACSB estimated that 5% of all business programs internationally, and most top business programs in the [[United States]], held AACSB accreditation.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013" /&gt; AACSB accreditation is seen as a standard requirement in graduate business education, and universities are more likely to accept [[transfer credit]] earned from accredited schools;&lt;ref name="HK 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilpert|first=Ditmar|author2=Thomas Kern |title=Success Factors of American Business Schools or "How Business Schools Attract Promising Students"|journal=Applied Marketing|year=2003|pages=995–1012|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18981-4_87|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has been called "the hallmark of excellence in business education".&lt;ref name=SMU&gt;{{cite web|title=SMU is one of the youngest universities to receive accreditation from oldest global accrediting body AACSB International|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/news/2011/04/11/smu-one-youngest-universities-receive-accreditation-oldest-global-accrediting-body|publisher=Singapore Management University|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loss given default''' or '''LGD''' is the share of an asset that is lost if a borrower defaults.

It is a common parameter in risk models and also a parameter used in the calculation of [[economic capital]], [[expected loss]] or [[regulatory capital]] under [[Basel II]] for a [[banking institution]]. This is an attribute of any exposure on bank's client. Exposure is the amount that one may lose in an investment.

The LGD is closely linked to the [[expected loss]], which is defined as the product of the LGD, the [[probability of default]] (PD) and the [[exposure at default]] (EAD).

==Definition==

LGD is the share of an asset that is lost when a borrower defaults. The ''recovery rate'' is defined as 1 minus the LGD, the share of an asset that is recovered when a borrower defaults.&lt;ref name="Altman2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altman|first1=Edward|last2=Resti|first2=Andrea|last3=Sironi|first3=Andrea|title=Default Recovery Rates in Credit Risk Modelling: A Review of the Literature and Empirical Evidence|journal=Economic Notes|date=July 2004|volume=33|issue=2|pages=183–208|doi=10.1111/j.0391-5026.2004.00129.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss given default is facility-specific because such losses are generally understood to be influenced by key transaction characteristics such as the presence of collateral and the degree of subordination.

==How to calculate LGD==

The LGD calculation is easily understood with the help of an example: If the client defaults with an outstanding debt of $200,000 and the bank or insurance is able to sell the security (e.g. a condo) for a net price of $160,000 (including costs related to the repurchase), then the LGD is 20% (= $40,000 / $200,000).

Theoretically, LGD is calculated in different ways, but the most popular is 'Gross' LGD, where total losses are divided by [[exposure at default]] (EAD). Another method is to divide Losses by the unsecured portion of a credit line (where security covers a portion of EAD). This is known as 'Blanco' LGD. If collateral value is zero in the last case then Blanco LGD is equivalent to Gross LGD. Different types of statistical methods can be used to do this.

Gross LGD is most popular amongst academics because of its simplicity and because academics only have access to bond market data, where collateral values often are unknown, uncalculated or irrelevant. Blanco LGD is popular amongst some practitioners (banks) because banks often have many secured facilities, and banks would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on secured portions due to depreciation of collateral quality. The latter calculation is also a subtle requirement of [[Basel II]], but most banks are not sophisticated enough at this time to make those types of calculations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Calculating LGD under the foundation approach (for corporate, sovereign and bank exposure)===

To determine required capital for a bank or financial institution under Basel II, the institution has to calculate risk-weighted assets. This requires estimating the LGD for each corporate, sovereign and bank exposure. There are two approaches for deriving this estimate: a foundation approach and an advanced approach.

====Exposure without Collateral====

Under the foundation approach, BIS prescribes fixed LGD ratios for certain classes of unsecured exposures:

* Senior claims on corporates, sovereigns and banks not secured by recognized collateral attract a 45% LGD.
* All subordinated claims on corporates, sovereigns and banks attract a 75% LGD.

====Exposure with Collateral====

Simple LGD example: If the client defaults, with an outstanding debt of 200,000 (EAD) and the bank is able to sell the security for a net price of 160,000 (including costs related to the repurchase), then 40,000, or 20%, of the EAD are lost - the LGD is 20%.

The effective loss given default (&lt;math&gt;L_{GD}^*&lt;/math&gt;) applicable to a collateralized transaction can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;
L_{GD}^* = L_{GD}\cdot\frac{E^*}{E}
&lt;/math&gt;
Haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the collateral and exposure (The standard supervisory haircut for currency risk where exposure and collateral are denominated in different currencies is 8%)

The *He and *Hc has to be derived from the following table of standard supervisory haircuts:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Haircut.gif]] --&gt;

However, under certain special circumstances the supervisors, i.e. the local central banks may choose not to apply the haircuts specified under the comprehensive approach, but instead to apply a zero H.

=== Calculating LGD under the advanced approach (and for the retail-portfolio under the foundation approach) ===

Under the [[A-IRB]] approach and for the retail-portfolio under the [[F-IRB]] approach, the bank itself determines the appropriate loss given default to be applied to each exposure, on the basis of robust data and analysis. The analysis must be capable of being validated both internally and by supervisors. Thus, a bank using internal loss given default estimates for capital purposes might be able to differentiate loss given default values on the basis of a wider set of transaction characteristics (e.g. product type, wider range of collateral types) as well as borrower characteristics. These values would be expected to represent a conservative view of long-run averages. A bank wishing to use its own estimates of LGD will need to demonstrate to its supervisor that it can meet additional minimum requirements pertinent to the integrity and reliability of these estimates.

An LGD model assesses the value and/or the quality of a security the bank holds for providing the loan – securities can be either machinery like cars, trucks or construction machines. It can be mortgages or it can be a custody account or a commodity. The higher the value of the security the lower the LGD and thus the potential loss the bank or insurance faces in the case of a default. Banks using the [[A-IRB]] approach have to determine LGD values, whereas banks within the [[F-IRB]] do only have to do so for the retail-portfolio. For example, as of 2013, there were nine companies in the United Kingdom with their own mortgage LGD models. In Switzerland there were two banks as of 2013. In Germany many thrifts – especially the market leader [[Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall]] – have their own mortgage LGD models. In the corporate asset class many German banks still only use the values given by the regulator under the [[F-IRB]] approach.

Repurchase Value Estimators (RVEs) have proven to be the best kind of tools for LGD estimates. The repurchase value ratio
provides the percentage of the value of the house/apartment (mortgages) or machinery at a given time compared to its purchase price.

==Downturn LGD==

Under Basel II, banks and other financial institutions are recommended to calculate 'Downturn LGD' (downturn loss given default), which reflects the losses occurring during a 'Downturn' in a business cycle for regulatory purposes. Downturn LGD is interpreted in many ways, and most financial institutions that are applying for IRB approval under BIS II often have differing definitions of what Downturn conditions are. One definition is at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in real GDP. Often, negative growth is also accompanied by a negative output gap in an economy (where potential production exceeds actual demand).

The calculation of LGD (or Downturn LGD) poses significant challenges to modelers and practitioners. Final resolutions of defaults can take many years and final losses, and hence final LGD, cannot be calculated until all of this information is ripe. Furthermore, practitioners are of want of data since BIS II implementation is rather new and financial institutions may have only just started collecting the information necessary for calculating the individual elements that LGD is composed of: EAD, direct and indirect Losses, security values and potential, expected future recoveries. Another challenge, and maybe the most significant, is the fact that the default definitions between institutions vary. This often results in a so-called differing cure-rates or percentage of defaults without losses. Calculation of LGD (average) is often composed of defaults with losses and defaults without. Naturally, when more defaults without losses are added to a sample pool of observations LGD becomes lower. This is often the case when default definitions become more 'sensitive' to credit deterioration or 'early' signs of defaults. When institutions use different definitions, LGD parameters therefore become non-comparable.

Many institutions are scrambling to produce estimates of Downturn LGD, but often resort to 'mapping' since Downturn data is often lacking. Mapping is the process of [[Guesstimate|guesstimating]] losses under a downturn by taking existing LGD and adding a supplement or buffer, which is supposed to represent a potential increase in LGD when Downturn occurs. LGD often decreases for some segments during Downturn since there is a relatively larger increase of defaults that result in higher cure-rates, often the result of temporary credit deterioration that disappears after the Downturn Period is over. Furthermore, LGD values decrease for defaulting financial institutions under economic Downturns because governments and central banks often rescue these institutions in order to maintain financial stability.

In 2010 researchers at Moody’s Analytics quantify an LGD in line with the target probability event intended to be captured under Basel. They illustrate that the Basel downturn LGD guidelines may not be sufficiently conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Amnon|last2=Meng|first2=Qiang|last3=Kaplin|first3=Andrew|last4=Wang|first4=Yashan|last5=Hu|first5=Zhenya|date=2010|title=Implications of PD-LGD Correlation in a Portfolio Setting|url=https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/whitepaper/before-2011/10-05-02-implications-of-pd-lgd-correlation-in-a-portfolio-setting.pdf|journal=Moody's Analytics Whitepaper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results are based on a structural model that incorporates systematic risk in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Amnon|last2=Hu|first2=Zhenya|date=2007|title=Incorporating Systematic Risk in Recovery: Theory and Evidence|url=https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/whitepaper/before-2011/04-20-07-incorporating-systemic-risk-in-recovery-theory-and-evidence.pdf|journal=Moody's Analytics Whitepaper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Correcting for different default definitions ==
One problem facing practitioners is the comparison of LGD estimates (usually averages) arising from different time periods where differing default definitions have been in place. The following formula can be used to compare LGD estimates from one time period (say x) with another time period (say y):

LGD&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;=LGD&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;*(1-Cure Rate&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)/(1-Cure Rate&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Country-specific LGD==

In Australia, the prudential regulator [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority|APRA]] has set an interim minimum downturn LGD of 20 per cent on residential mortgages for all applicants for the advanced Basel II approaches. The 20 per cent floor is not risk sensitive and is designed to encourage the [[Authorised Deposit-Taking Institution|ADI]]s to undertake further work, which APRA believes would be closer to the 20 per cent on average than ADIs’ original estimates.

== Importance ==

LGD warrants more attention than what has been given to it in the past decade, where credit risk models often assumed that LGD was time-invariant. Movements in LGD result in often proportional movements in required economic capital. According to BIS (2006) institutions implementing Advanced-IRB instead of Foundation-IRB will experience larger decreases in Tier 1 capital, and the internal calculation of LGD is a factor separating the two Methods.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''New Kanpur City''' is a satellite city of [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Kanpur is one of the biggest industrial cities of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and will soon have a brand new satellite city named New Kanpur City. The new city will spread over 10,000 acres of prime land on the banks of the [[Ganges]].
Co-operative housing societies will get preference for allotment of plots in this new city. The remaining land will be allotted to the private developers with the clause that they will develop houses covering minimum 25 per cent of the plot area. According to Mr. Sushil Kumar new Kanpur city will be the most modern and well planned city in the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.accommodationtimes.com/indian-city/kanpur/new-kanpur-city-in-offing/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land Proposed==

Over 10,000 acres of land is proposed for New Kanpur City Between Bithoor and Azad Nagar on a 4 lane Road Kanpur-Bithoor Road or Mainawati Marg.

==Economy==

Various IT Firms and Multi National Companies have been invited by Uttar Pradesh government to set up their regional offices in Kanpur and Lucknow. There is a strong  potential of New Kanpur City being developed as IT neighbourhood of Kanpur in coming years as it is in close proximity to IIT-Kanpur and Kanpur University. The place is also ideal for the Multi National Companies as the weather in the region of North West Kanpur is pleasant as compared.to other regions. The Agra Lucknow Expressway is also in close proximity from the region which makes it easier for the residents to travel to Delhi and Agra. Beside, there has been a proposal of setting up a large international airport on the road to [[Kannauj]] from Kanpur which is in close proximity from the region. Railways have also extended their connectivity to Bithoor via New Kanpur City and there have been plans to operate rail services from Bithoor to Delhi via [[Kanpur Anwarganj railway station]], [[Govindpuri railway station]] and [[Panki railway station]] on Horwah-Delhi main line.

The '''Office of Technology Assessment''' ('''OTA''') was an office of the [[United States Congress]] from 1972 to 1995. OTA's purpose was to provide Congressional members and committees with objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century, i.e. [[technology assessment]]. It was a leader in practicing and encouraging delivery of public services in innovative and inexpensive ways, including early involvement in the distribution of government documents through [[electronic publishing]]. Its model was widely copied around the world.

[[Princeton University]] hosts The OTA Legacy site, which holds "the complete collection of OTA publications along with additional materials that illuminate the history and impact of the agency". On July 23, 2008 the [[Federation of American Scientists]] launched a similar archive that includes interviews and additional documents about OTA.

==History==
Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment with the Technology Assessment Act of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg797.pdf |title=Technology Assessment Act of 1972 ~ Public Law 92-484 |date=October 13, 1972 |series=86 Stat. 797 ~ House Bill 10243 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}} ([http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/ns20/act_f.html HTML version])&lt;/ref&gt; It was governed by a twelve-member board, comprising six members of Congress from each party — half from the Senate and half from the House of Representatives.  During its twenty-four-year life it produced about 750 studies on a wide range of topics, including [[acid rain]], [[health care]], global [[climate change]], and [[polygraphs]].

===Closure===
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal |align=right|image1=OTAShirt-Front.png|image2=OTAShirt-Back.png|footer=The front and back of a tee shirt created and worn by some staff of the OTA to express their sentiments about the intent of the 104th Congress to terminate their service while simultaneously increasing the Library of Congress' budget by an amount equal to nearly twice that of OTA's. Compare to the official seal above, and note the arm of Congress strangling the symbolic U.S.A. in the satirical version.}}

Criticism of the agency was fueled by ''Fat City'', a 1980 book by [[Donald Lambro]] that was regarded favorably by the Reagan administration; it called OTA an "unnecessary agency" that duplicated government work done elsewhere.  OTA was abolished (technically "de-funded") in the "[[Contract with America]]" period of [[Newt Gingrich]]'s Republican ascendancy in Congress.

When the [[104th Congress]] withdrew funding for OTA, it had a full-time staff of 143 people and an annual budget of $21.9 million.  The Office of Technology Assessment closed on September 29, 1995. The move was criticized at the time, including by Republican representative [[Amo Houghton]], who commented at the time of OTA’s defunding that "we are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2010/06/nader-proposes-reviving-congressional-office-of-technology-assessment/ Nader proposes reviving Congressional Office of Technology Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the closure saw it as an example of politics overriding science, and a variety of scientists have called for the agency's reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/09/14/bring-back-the-ota/ |title=Bring back the OTA |accessdate=2013-03-12 |author=PZ Myers |date=September 14, 2007|publisher=[[Scienceblogs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
While the OTA was closed down, the idea of [[technology assessment]] survived, in particular in Europe. The [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network coordinates members of [[technology assessment]] units working for various European governments. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] has meanwhile established a TA unit, taking on former duties of the OTA.

While campaigning in the [[2008 US presidential election]], [[Hillary Clinton]] pledged to work to restore the OTA if elected [[United States President|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Healy |author2=Cornelia Dean |title=Clinton Says She Would Shield Science From Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/us/politics/05clinton.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page= |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=3570 |title=Scientific Integrity and Innovation: Remarks at the Carnegie Institution for Science |accessdate=2007-10-05 |date=October 4, 2007}} Text of Clinton's speech to the [[Carnegie Institution]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 29, 2009, House of Representatives member [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] of New Jersey wrote an op-ed piece articulating the argument for restoring the OTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/fromthefields-holt/ |first=Rush |last=Holt |authorlink=Rush D. Holt, Jr. |title=Lobotomy |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2009-04-29 |date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 The [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] released a report entitled "Reinventing Technology Assessment" that emphasized citizen engagement and called for performing the functions of the OTA by creating a nationwide network of non-partisan policy research organizations, universities, and science museums: the Expert &amp; Citizen Assessment of Science &amp; Technology (ECAST) network. ECAST would conduct both expert and participatory technology assessments for Congress and other clients.  The author of the report was Dr. Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute.  The report states that the drive to modernize OTA was initiated by [[Darlene Cavalier]], a popular citizen science advocate and author of the Science Cheerleader blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/ReinventingTechnologyAssessment1.pdf |title= Reinventing Technology Assessment: A 21st Century Model |accessdate=2010-05-05 | author=Richard Sclove |date=April 2010 |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalier outlined the idea of the citizen network in a guest blog post for [[Discover Magazine]]'s The Intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/29/a-little-respect-involving-citizens-in-technology-assessment/ |title=A Little Respect: Involving Citizens in Technology Assessment |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Discover}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced the concept in an article in Science Progress in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/07/harnessing-citizen-scientists/ |title=Harnessing Citizen Scientists |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=July 7, 2008|publisher=Science Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open allocation''' refers to a management style in which employees are given a high degree of freedom in choosing what projects to work on, and how to allocate their time. They do not necessarily answer to a single manager, but to the company and their peers. They can [[internal hiring|transfer]] between projects regardless of headcount allowances, performance reviews, or tenure at the company, as long as they are providing value to projects that are useful to the business goals of the company.&lt;ref name='fastcolabs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcolabs.com/3020181/open-company/inside-githubs-super-lean-management-strategy-and-how-it-drives-innovation|title=Inside GitHub's Super-Lean Management Strategy--And How It Drives Innovation|work=Fastcolabs|date=18 October 2013|accessdate=28 October 2013|last=Dannen|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open allocation has been described as a process of self-organization. Rather than teams and leadership arrangements existing permanently in a company, such relationships form as they are needed (around important projects) and disband when they are no longer necessary. Additionally, open allocation implies that projects are not unilaterally created and staffed by executive mandate. Rather, the person forming the project (who might not be an official manager) is responsible for convincing others to invest their time, energy, and careers into the effort.

== History ==

The term '''lattice organization''' for an organization using open allocation was coined by [[Bill Gore]] in 1967. He used the term to describe the company he founded, [[W. L. Gore and Associates]].

[[Google]] introduced and publicised an unusual perk known as [[20% time]], in which - in theory - employees have freedom over one-fifth of their working time, which may be put into a personal project or a high-priority internal effort outside of management's direction. However, the other 80% of the time employees would be still working under closed allocation, and also may not in practice be able to use their 20% time all of the time, for example due to deadline pressures.

While [[startup company|startups]] vary wildly in work environment quality and employee autonomy, one of the main selling points of technology startups in the early 21st century has been a claim - demonstrably true of the best startups, but not of all of them - that employees enjoy a high level of autonomy, at a level traditionally only seen in [[basic research]] labs.&lt;ref name='ssrn'&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=2170954|title=Founder or Joiner? The Role of Preferences and Context in Shaping Different Entrepreneurial Interests|journal=Management Science|via=Social Science Research Network|date=24 September 2014|last=Roach|first=Michael|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2014.2100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GitHub]] and [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], in the early 2010s, became well known for having such environments. In 2013, [[Tom Preston-Werner]] gave a talk at [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention|Oscon]] in which he spoke about the importance of open allocation to GitHub's success.

== Leadership under open allocation ==

Organizations using open allocation do not give [[middle manager]]s unilateral control over their reports' work. People management, product direction, and project-specific leadership are, in this way, decoupled. One argument in favor of this is that when the people defining projects no longer have the unilateral ability to [[termination of employment|terminate]] employees or deprive them of opportunity, better projects and leaders (those that can convince, rather than coerce) will emerge. Middle management may play roles, however, in mentoring, handling of conflict (as an absolute last line of dispute resolution), and (especially) ensuring that new hires are appropriately "onboarded" into the open allocation system.

Leadership in an open-allocation organization is typically organic; the person to propose the project will lead it, if he or she can convince others to follow.&lt;ref name='fastcolabs'/&gt;&lt;ref name='guardian-gore'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/02/gore-tex-textiles-terri-kelly|title=Gore-Tex gets made without managers|date=2 November 2008|first=Simon|last=Caulkin|work=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When projects end, the leaders may rotate back into being "followers", and there is no stigma attached to this.&lt;ref name='newell-interview'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-27/why-there-are-no-bosses-at-valve|title=Why There Are No Bosses at Valve|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=27 April 2012|work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading and following are temporary distinctions and largely by choice; one may choose to follow in order to learn more about a different part of the business, for example. Ideally, the leader for each project will be the most committed, capable or passionate person involved, and companywide rank (which may not exist at all) has little to no bearing on the selection.

Performance reviews in open allocation companies are handled in a variety of ways. Valve uses [[stack ranking]] driven by [[peer review]] to determine raises and bonuses, but unlike the hated stack-ranking regimes of some other technology companies, these do not initiate termination or interfere with internal mobility, but are strictly used to determine compensation.&lt;ref name='bbc-valve'/&gt;

== Benefits of open allocation ==

* '''Information:''' In a closed-allocation company, the people doing the work and those deciding what is to be worked on are typically disjoint sets. This means that impractical projects are often proposed because the people responsible for the firm's executive function are deprived of important knowledge—in particular, whether the people doing the work consider the project worth investing their time, energy, and reputation. (If the answer is negative, they typically cannot communicate it, especially in [[at-will employment]] situations.) 
* '''[[Peer review]]''' can be used and encouraged not only for source code, but also design, business strategy, and publicity.&lt;ref name='fastcolabs'/&gt; More people are allowed input into the issues they consider important. 
* '''Motivation:''' Employees who have chosen their projects are more likely to be productive and highly motivated. There is more personal pride at stake when the person selected or defined where to put his or her efforts. 
* '''Personal responsibility''': People can no longer blame bad project assignments or inept immediate managers for underperformance, since those are results of their own choices. A person who worked on a bad project, in an open-allocation environment, is at fault. 
* '''Efficiency''': Hierarchies of people (which frequently duplicate efforts) are replaced with conceptual hierarchies, but extra-hierarchical collaboration (the norm, in an open-allocation company) allows cross-domain knowledge to be formed and deployed. An employee who wants to start a new project that may add value to the business can do so immediately, but those that require investment of others' resources and time require convincing them that the idea is valuable.&lt;ref name='bbc-valve'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24205497|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Valve: How going boss-free empowered the games-maker|first=Leo|last=Kelion|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, workers are trusted with their own time, but disallowed from attempting to control others' time. 
* '''Communication''': In the ideal open-allocation environment, anyone can communicate with anyone else in the company, without having to pass a message up and down a management relay.  
* '''Less waste''': One theory on the causes of corporate efficiency is that much unused or low-quality work is the "promotion-oriented" kind, directed by a manager for his or her career goals while generating little or no value for the company. Under open allocation, it is difficult to staff such projects. However, unpleasant but important work ''will'' get done, because performing it well will lead to more esteem among peers, and make it easier to lead others in the future. 
* '''Low turnover''': Open-allocation companies typically have low turnover.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} People rarely leave, because the work environment is considered superior to the norm; they are rarely fired, because there are so many avenues toward success that most people can find a project where they can perform well.

== Problems ==

Because open allocation is an unusual  organizational style, it can be at odds with external demands on an organization. For example, consulting companies that promise a certain number of staff will work on a project must assign work to people in order to meet those commitments. Additionally, regulatory pressures such as [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] may require that people are assigned to certain duties.

Additionally, open allocation's strongest successes are in businesses in the areas of science, technology, and in particular, software - the most successful of which are typically staffed by highly competent and educated people. Whether the successes of open allocation apply more generally to other types of organizations is an open question.

Finally, terminating employees in an open-allocation environment can be challenging, because establishing a performance-based case in such a flexible environment is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} While open allocation generally creates fewer of the "unlucky" low-performers who landed on the poorly-fitting projects or with incompatible managers, and therefore tends to reduce turnover (voluntary and involuntary) dramatically, it doesn't provide a mechanism for getting rid of severe under- or non-performers who "hide" in the organization. This has not been an issue to this point, if only because the companies using open allocation have been highly selective ones that can hire people with strong track records. Furthermore, the increase in performance among high performers under open allocation is typically [[10x programmer|so dramatic]] as to counteract any risk of decline among the lower performers.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Mechanics ===

At Valve Corporation, employees' desks have wheels under them, allowing them to move to another team with ease - a symbolic as well as practical marker of Valve's open allocation approach - and physically reorganize as their projects demand.&lt;ref name='bbc-valve'/&gt;

GitHub, on the other hand, has many [[telecommuting|remote employees]], so team membership is to some extent determined by which [[chat room]]s an employee is in.&lt;ref name='fastcolabs'/&gt;

Treehouse allows any team member to switch teams at any time, but says that it is "not cool" to leave a team at a critical time or when you are needed by your team-mates, and such an action would be reflected in poor performance reviews.&lt;ref name='treehouse'/&gt;

'''Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno''' (born 28 June 1969) is an Indonesian businessman, investor and politician who was the Deputy Governor of [[Jakarta]]. He was elected along with [[Anies Baswedan]] in the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017|2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election]] after defeating incumbent pair [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]] (widely known as "Ahok") and [[Djarot Saiful Hidayat]]. He resigned the office to run as [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s running mate for the [[Indonesian general election, 2019|2019 Indonesian presidential election]].

A graduate of [[George Washington University]], Sandiaga worked for several companies and rose in rank before founding his own business, which led him to become one of the richest people in Indonesia. In 2015, he resigned from his companies to join [[Great Indonesia Movement Party|Gerindra]].

== Career ==
=== Business ===
Sandi Uno graduated from [[Wichita State University]] in 1990 and from [[George Washington University]] with an MBA in 1992, paid by William Soerjadjaja, because his mother personally knew the Astra International group founder.&lt;ref&gt;https://sandiagauno.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/sisi-kelam-pengusaha-muda-sandiaga-uno/&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}} He began his career with Summa Bank in 1990. In 1994, he joined MP Group Holding Limited as an investment manager. The following year, he began working for NTI Resources Ltd in [[Canada]] and worked as an Executive Vice President in the company. The 1997 financial crisis hit NTI Resources Ltd hard and caused it to go into administration, leaving him unemployed.&lt;ref name="kompas"/&gt;

In 1997, he co-founded PT. Recapital Advisors with his high school friend, [[Rosan Perkasa Roeslani]]. the following year, he co-founded Saratoga Capital with Edwin Soeryadjaya, son of William Soerjadjaja. Both businesses continue to flourish today. Listed as 29th richest man in Indonesia according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in 2009,&lt;ref name="kompas"&gt;{{cite news|language=id|last=Grahadyarini|first=BM Lukita|work=Kompas|date=4 September 2008|url=http://cetak.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/09/04/0124478/kebangkitan.hidup.sandiaga.uno|title=Kebangkitan Hidup Sandiaga Uno|accessdate=13 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905071646/http://cetak.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/09/04/0124478/kebangkitan.hidup.sandiaga.uno|archivedate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he continued to grow his businesses, buying a controlling (51%) stake in [[Mandala Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detikfinance.com/read/2011/05/20/075823/1642986/4/sandiaga-uno-berharap-mandala-bisa-terbang-lagi-juni|title=Sandiaga Uno Berharap Mandala Bisa Terbang Lagi Juni|author=Suhendra|work=detikFinance|date=20 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521001839/http://us.detikfinance.com/read/2011/05/20/075823/1642986/4/sandiaga-uno-berharap-mandala-bisa-terbang-lagi-juni|archivedate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2011. He was listed as 47th richest man in Indonesia according to ''Forbes'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sandiaga-salahuddin-uno/|website=Forbes|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, his name appeared on the list of [[Panama Papers]] (known as Tax Scandal), although he denies he evaded taxes or broke the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nailufar|first1=Nibras Nada|editor-last1=Djumena|editor-first1=Erlangga|title=Sandiaga Uno Benarkan Perusahaannya Ada di "Panama Papers"|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2016/04/06/12025491/Sandiaga.Uno.Benarkan.Perusahaannya.Ada.di.Panama.Papers.|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Kompas]]|date=6 April 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
He decided to leave the business world, entering politics in mid-2015. In the period from April to July 2015, he officially resigned from various positions in 16 subsidiaries of Saratoga and Recapital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narita|first1=Indrastiti|editor-last1=Ali|editor-first1=Fidel|title=Sandiaga Uno Lepaskan 16 jabatan di Saratoga|url=http://bisniskeuangan.kompas.com/read/2015/06/04/094317026/Sandiaga.Uno.Lepaskan.16.jabatan.di.Saratoga|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Kompas]]|date=4 June 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the [[Gerindra]] party as vice chairman of the board of supervisors, he was catapulted to the second highest office after [[Prabowo Subianto|Prabowo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ningtyas|first1=Ika|editor-last1=|editor-first1=|title=Tinggalkan Bisnis, Sandiaga Uno Akhirnya Masuk Gerindra|url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2015/05/07/093664440/tinggalkan-bisnis-sandiaga-uno-akhirnya-masuk-gerindra|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Tempo]]|date=7 May 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name began to be considered by Gerindra to be nominated in the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017|2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election]].

Late in 2015, several volunteer community support groups began to emerge, including "''Sahabat Sandiaga Uno''" (Friends of Sandiaga Uno or SSU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudi|first1=Alsadad|editor-last1=Afrianti|editor-first1=Desy|title=Datang ke "Car Free Day", Sandiaga Uno Sapa Pendukungnya|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/10/11/09145001/Datang.ke.Car.Free.Day.Sandiaga.Uno.Sapa.Pendukungnya|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Kompas|date=11 October 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began making visits to various locations within Jakarta. In early 2016, Sandiaga Uno, with assistance of his supporters, began to intensify visits to various locations in Jakarta. Performing visits to up to 7 different locations a day, for the 6-month period from February to August 2016. The rumour of his candidacy intensified, as news leaked of the desire of 7 political parties to form a grand coalition in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adyatama|first1=Egi|editor-last1=|editor-first1=|title=Pilkada DKI, 7 Partai Bentuk Koalisi Kekeluargaan Lawan Ahok|url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2016/08/08/231794172/pilkada-dki-7-partai-bentuk-koalisi-kekeluargaan-lawan-ahok|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Tempo]]|date=8 August 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This desire was not realised following the withdrawal the ruling [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle|PDI-P]] party, which threw its weight behind incumbent governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama|Ahok]], along with [[Golkar]], [[People's Conscience Party|Hanura]] and [[Nasdem Party|Nasdem]]. The [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]], [[National Mandate Party|PAN]], [[National Awakening Party|PKB]] and [[United Development Party|PPP]] then announced it planned to nominate [[Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono]] (son of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carina|first1=Jessi|editor-last1=Rastika|editor-first1=Icha|title=Agus-Sylvi Nomor 1, Ahok-Djarot Nomor 2, dan Anies-Sandiaga Nomor 3|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2016/10/25/20421221/agus-sylvi.nomor.urut.1.ahok-djarot.nomor.2.dan.anies-sandiaga.nomor.urut.3|accessdate=21 December 2016|work=Kompas|date=25 October 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining parties, Gerindra and [[Prosperous Justice Party|PKS]], agreed to remain in the coalition, selecting former Education Minister [[Anies Baswedan]] as their candidate, and Sandiaga Uno as his running mate. Sandi said, he had suggested Baswedan to Prabowo because he felt that Baswedan would be more suitable for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yulika|first1=Nila Chrisna|editor-last1=Sunariyah|editor-first1=Sunariyah|title=Mengapa Sandiaga Uno Berikan Posisi Cagub ke Anies Baswedan?|url=http://pilkada.liputan6.com/read/2611015/mengapa-sandiaga-uno-berikan-posisi-cagub-ke-anies-baswedan|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Liputan 6|date=26 September 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following victory in the election, which an editorial described as "the most polarizing and most divisive the nation has ever seen in Indonesian political history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/17/asia/jakarta-election-indonesia/index.html|title=Religious tensions rise in Jakarta as crucial vote gets underway|last=CNN|first=Ben Westcott,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the incarceration of [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama|Ahok]], he was made vice governor on 16 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supporters greet new Jakarta leaders at Sunda Kelapa Mosque|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/16/supporters-greet-new-jakarta-leaders-at-sunda-kelapa-mosque.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, he was accused of paying opposition parties [[National Mandate Party|PAN]] and [[Prosperous Justice Party|PKS]] Rp 500 billion (USD 35 million) each to approve him as [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s vice presidential candidate for the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political uproar after Sandiaga Uno accused of paying PAN &amp; PKS IDR500 billion each to be Prabowo’s VP pick|url=https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/political-uproar-sandiaga-uno-accused-paying-pan-pks-idr500-billion-prabowos-vp-pick/ |accessdate=9 August 2018 |work=Coconuts Jakarta |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, he declared his resignation from his office to participate in the election on 10 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.viva.co.id/berita/politik/1063417-sandiaga-uno-resmi-mundur-dari-wakil-gubernur-dki|title=Sandiaga Uno resmi mundur dari wakil gubernur DKI|date=10 August 2018|work=VIVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation was made official on 18 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabar24.bisnis.com/read/20180918/15/839406/dirjen-otonomi-daerah-disetujui-presiden-jokowi-sandiaga-uno-resmi-tak-jabat-wagub-dki- Dirjen Otonomi Daerah: Disetujui Presiden Jokowi, Sandiaga Uno Resmi Tak Jabat Wagub DKI]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paradise Papers ===
{{See also|Paradise Papers}}In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalism]] cited his name in [[List of people and organisations named in the Paradise Papers|the list of politicians named in]] "[[Paradise Papers]]" allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=Explore The Politicians in the Paradise Papers - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was claimed to have own an offshore company named NTI resources, as well as several shell companies in British Virgin Islands. Regarding this, the Indonesian Minister of Finance, [[Sri Mulyani|Sri Mulyani]], vowed to study the legitimacy of the paper, and will take an appropriate measure if there was any wrongdoing conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1031425/perusahaan-prabowo-dan-sandiaga-tersangkut-paradise-papers/|title=Perusahaan Prabowo dan Sandiaga tersangkut Paradise Papers - Tempo|work=Tempo.co|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program===
Even before his appointment to the vice governorship, Sandiaga proceeded to execute plans mentioned during his campaigning. In early October, an entrepreneurship program dubbed ''OK OCE'' (One Kecamatan, One Center for Entrepreneurship), which he had called for during the election, was initiated with his elder brother Indra initially acting as president, although the following day he was replaced due to nepotism concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haq|first1=Muhammad Fida Ul|title=Kakak Sandiaga akan Pimpin Program OK OCE, Dapat Dana APBD Rp 1,5 M|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/3678855/kakak-sandiaga-akan-pimpin-program-ok-oce-dapat-dana-apbd-rp-15-m|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=detiknews|date=11 October 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keputusan Sandiaga Uno Copot Kakaknya Dari Ketua OK OCE Diapresiasi|url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2017/10/12/keputusan-sandiaga-uno-copot-kakaknya-dari-ketua-ok-oce-diapresiasi|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=Wartakota|publisher=[[Kompas Gramedia]]|date=12 October 2017|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle''''' is a 2009 book by [[Dan Senor]] and [[Saul Singer]] about the [[economy of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saul Singer interview on Startup Camel Podcast about the challenges Israel is facing as a global innovation leader.|url=http://startupcamel.com/ep-30-saul-singer-startup-nation|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Startup Camel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines how Israel, a 60-year-old nation with a population of 7.1 million, was able to reach such economic growth that "at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the [[NASDAQ]], more than those of any other foreign country."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

In 2010, ''Start-up Nation'' was ranked fifth on the business [[bestseller]] list of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/bestseller/besthardbusiness.html NYT Hardcover Business Best Sellers]&lt;/ref&gt; It also reached ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjp.org/local_includes/downloads/46889.pdf The Massachusetts-Israel Economic Relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book overview==
The [[Council on Foreign Relations]] states in its publisher's blurb for the book that ''Start-up Nation'' addresses the question: "How is it that Israel—a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources—produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom?"&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' notes that Israel now has more high-tech [[Startup company|start-ups]] and a larger [[Venture capital in Israel|venture capital industry]] per capita than any other country in the world. The success of Israel's high-tech sector over the past two decades has attracted recent attention from business journalists and ''The Economist'' describes ''Start-up Nation'' as the most notable of a "growing pile" of books on the subject.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard "the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are [[Conscription in Israel|mandatory military service]] and [[Aliyah|immigration]].&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt;

The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued.&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt; IDF soldiers "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Neither [[Military rank|rank]]s nor ages matter much "when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles," and "Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

The book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: "Immigrants are not averse to start from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose."&lt;ref name=inaglobal/&gt;

Additional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, a culture where individuals frequently tinker with technology, and government policies friendly to start-ups.&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt;

Using stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them "the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts."&lt;ref name="The Weekly Standard"/&gt;

While the book describes Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, in the words of one reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own [[Nokia]], [[Samsung]], or [[IBM]]. According to the book's authors, this is partly because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.&lt;ref name=Monitor/&gt;

Senor and Singer interviewed over 100 people to write the book, among them leading Israeli venture investors including key players in [[Google]], [[Intel]], and [[Cisco]]; and historians, U.S. military leaders, and Israeli heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Senor and Singer, pp. 240-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Their conclusion is that "while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Senor and Singer, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==

Dan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the [[United States]] government. He served as chief spokesmen for the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in [[Iraq]] and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former [[editorial page]] editor for ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Praise===
Jon Rosen OF ''[[USA Today]]'' believes that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and may irk those with reservations about Israeli foreign policy, but it is still an accomplishment, "not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; In ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[James K. Glassman]] says that "the greatest strength of ''Start-up Nation'' is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'"&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' states that "the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"/&gt;

In ''[[The Economic Times]]'', [[R Gopalakrishnan]] writes that the use of [[Hebrew]] expressions makes the book "alive and eminently-readable."&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt; Besides ''chutzpah'', the authors use the word ''bitzua'', which roughly means "getting things done." Another Hebrew expression used in the book is ''rosh gadol'', literally "big head", which could be translated "can-do and responsible attitude with scant respect for the limitations of formal authority." Gopalakrishnan concludes that the ideas demonstrated in the book "are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture."&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt;

[[David Horovitz]] of ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' says that conclusions of ''Start-up Nation'' find confirmation in the real world, such as  how the life of Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]] was saved when an emergency medical team applied a revolutionary elasticized bandage developed in Israel to staunch her head wounds.&lt;ref name=TJP/&gt;

A review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' says that "the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs" such as the story of [[Shvat Shaked]], who "founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software."&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt; The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing "straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies".&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt;

Maureen Farrell of ''[[Forbes]]'' was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of U.S. foreign aid, but says the book "is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

===Criticism===
Ruth Schuster, reviewing the book for ''[[Haaretz]]'', feels that it is "tarnished by a jarring, tub-thumping patriotism."&lt;ref name=haaretzrev /&gt; A review in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' notes that "critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq-listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be."&lt;ref name=Monitor/&gt;

Economist [[Yusuf Mansur]], writing in the ''[[Jordan Times]]'', argues that two of the factors to which Senor and Singer attribute Israel's success, the IDF and Soviet-Jewish immigration, have only been sustainable because of the foreign aid that Israel receives from the United States and private sources. Mansur also faults the authors for suggesting that the disparity between entrepreneurship in Israel's Arab and Jewish sectors is rooted in the exemption of Arabs from military service rather than what Mansour perceives to be "the discriminatory policies of Israel against its Arab citizens," particularly in education and the labor market.&lt;ref name=jordantimes&gt;[http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=25450 "Financing 'the start-up nation'"], ''Jordan Times'', April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gal Beckerman, writing in ''[[The Forward]]'' magazine, observes that the book "presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians, or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements."&lt;ref name=beckerman&gt;Beckerman, Gal: [http://www.forward.com/articles/126843/ "Senor Decides Against Running for Senate, Citing Family and Business"], ''[[The Forward]]'', March 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended ''Start-up Nation'' as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship. A review of the book in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0626/1224273322693.html What Ireland has to learn from Israel's high tech companies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrius Kubilius]], the prime minister of Lithuania, has cited ''Start-up Nation'' as his favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.themarker.com/startup-nation-without-physics-teachers-1.333940 Startup nation without physics teachers], [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yrjö Ojasaar, managing partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia, says "there is much to be learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solonpartners.com/?p=961 Solon Partners: Start-up Nation. The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle]&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's [[Fareed Zakaria]] called ''Start-up Nation'' "a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2009/11/09/gps.book.of.the.week.cnn |title=Book of the Week |work=[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]] |publisher=CNN |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is cited as a handbook of "classic economics." It teaches small businesses "how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team places an emphasis on [[chutzpah]] first."&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbiztrends.com/2009/12/start-up-nation-business-lessons-from-israel.html Start-Up Nation: Business Lessons from Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]] reportedly keeps a copy of ''Start-up Nation'' on his desk as a source of inspiration for the [[West Bank]]'s own burgeoning technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli Technology Companies Turn to West Bank for Outsourcing |author=Gwen Ackerman |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-15/israeli-technology-companies-turn-to-west-bank-for-outsourcing.html |newspaper=Bloomberg News |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd headquarters building Kobe01s5s2040.jpg|thumb|Headquarters ([[Kobe]], [[Japan]])]]
{{nihongo|'''Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd.'''|住友ゴム工業株式会社|Sumitomo Gomu Kōgyo Kabushiki-gaisha}} is a global [[tire]] and [[rubber]] company based in [[Japan]].  It is part of the [[Sumitomo Group]]. The company makes a wide range of [[rubber]] based products, including automobile [[tire]]s, golf balls and tennis balls. Sumitomo brands include [[Dunlop Tyres]], [[Falken Tire]] and Ohtsu Tire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohtsu Tires |url=https://ohtsu-tires.com |publisher=Ohtsu-Tires.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The company traces its origins to 1909, when the [[Sumitomo Group]] made an investment in '''Dunlop Japan''', the newly formed Japanese subsidiary of the British company [[Dunlop Rubber]].  Over the years Sumitomo and Dunlop developed a close business relationship, and in 1963 the Sumitomo Group acquired control of Dunlop Japan and renamed it '''Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd'''.

In 1985, when Dunlop Rubber was taken over by [[BTR plc]], the company acquired the automobile tire assets of Dunlop, including the right to use the Dunlop brand on automobile tires.  The acquisition did not include the US and Australian businesses, which were separately owned, but in 1986 Sumitomo also acquired the Dunlop Tire Corporation of the US from its management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4D9143FF932A15752C1A960948260 |title=Dunlop Stake For Sumitomo |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=November 21, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Sumitomo formed a joint venture with [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], by which Goodyear and Sumitomo agreed to manufacture tires for each other's markets, including Dunlop branded tires.  As part of the agreement, Goodyear acquired 75% interests in [[Dunlop Tyres]], the UK company which Sumitomo had formed, and in Dunlop Tire Corporation.  Goodyear and Sumitomo also made investments in each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/0000950152-99-006544.txt |title=Goodyear form 10-Q for quarter ended June 30, 1999 |page=28 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2014, Goodyear announced its intention to dissolve its partnership with Sumitomo due to alleged  "anticompetitive conduct". On June 4, 2015, Goodyear announced the end of its joint venture with SRI, effective end of year 2015. The brand Dunlop will be shared between the 2 companies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodyear-and-sumitomo-rubber-scrap-dunlop-alliance-1433418546 |title=Goodyear and Sumitomo Rubber Scrap Dunlop Alliance |author=Yoko Kubota |date=June 4, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in North America, Goodyear will control the Dunlop brand for replacement tires and for new cars made by non-Japanese auto makers. Sumitomo Rubber will hold rights to the Dunlop brand for new cars made by Japanese auto makers, as well as for motorcycles
* in most parts of Europe, Goodyear will control the Dunlop brand
* in Japan, Sumitomo Rubber will retain rights to the Dunlop brand

In December 2013 Sumitomo Rubber Industries acquired Apollo Tyres South Africa (Pty) Ltd from [[Apollo Tyres]], which owned the Dunlop tyre brand in South Africa, as part of its strategic global development plans. It subsequently renamed the company '''Sumitomo Rubber South Africa (Pty) Ltd'''. 

Sumitomo Rubber South Africa manufactures the Dunlop, Sumitomo and Falken passenger car tyre brands in [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal]]. 

The Ladysmith plant began to produce Dunlop truck and bus radial tyres in July 2018, following the second of two large investments by Sumitomo Rubber Industries to upgrade and modernise the plant.

Dunlop truck and bus radial tyres produced in Ladysmith will be sold in the South African market and will also be exported to several African states from 2019.

==Falken Tire==

The [[Falken Tire]] brand was launched by Sumitomo in Japan in 1983, and was introduced in North America two years later.

In January 2016, after the dissolution of the partnership with Goodyear, the Sumitomo Rubber USA factory in Tonawanda, New York began to produce Falken Tire-branded tires.

==SRI Sports Limited==

'''SRI Sports Limited''' is the subsidiary of Sumitomo that specializes in [[sports equipment]], with the main focus being [[tennis]] and [[golf]]. SRI Sports owns [[Srixon]], [[Cleveland Golf]], its subsidiary, Never Compromise, as well as rights to the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] name in most parts of the world.

Srixon produces [[tennis ball]]s, [[golf ball]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]], and a full range of golfing accessories. It holds several [[professional golfer]]s under endorsement deals including [[Graeme McDowell]] and [[Keegan Bradley]].

Cleveland Golf also makes a full range of [[golf equipment]], and has endorsement deals with [[Vijay Singh]] and [[Boo Weekley]] among others.

Following the acquisition of Cleveland Golf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSWEN204620071031 |title=Quiksilver sells Cleveland Golf unit |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |date=October 30, 2007 |publisher=[[Reuters]] | first=Emily | last=Chasan}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRI Sports announced their intention to consolidate its operations, with Cleveland overseeing marketing and distribution across North America, with Srixon doing the same in Europe and Australia, and Dunlop taking over in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clubandresortbusiness.com/2008/06/30/sri-sports-announces-worldwide-clevelandsrixon-consolidation/ |title=SRI Sports Announces Worldwide Cleveland/Srixon Consolidation |date=June 30, 2008 |publisher=Club &amp; Resort Business |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition of Dunlop brands from Sports Direct ==
In 2016, Sumitomo Rubber filed for regulatory approval before the [[Philippine Competition Commission]] in connection with its planned acquisition of Dunlop-related wholesale, manufacturing, and licensing business from [[Sports Direct]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phcc.gov.ph/commission-decision-no-06-m-0772016-acquisition-sumitomorubber-dunlopbrands/|title=Commission Decision No. 06-M-077/2016: Acquisition by Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. of Shares in Dunlop Brands Limited, et al. and Assets Owned by Dunlop Sports Group Americas, Inc. - Philippine Competition Commission|website=phcc.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company intended to acquire the entire issued share capital of Dunlop Brands Limited, Dunlop Slazenger 1902 Limited, and Dunlop Australia Limited, and the Dunlop-related business of Dunlop Sports Group Americas, Inc. which are subsidiaries of Sports Direct.

Sumitomo Rubber manufactures and sells tires under the Dunlop brand name in many countries including Japan, as well as sports goods in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The Philippine Competition Commission has approved the regulatory filing for the said acquisition in the same year. The acquisition allowed Sumitomo Rubber to consolidate the Dunlop brand across various products including sports goods worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
