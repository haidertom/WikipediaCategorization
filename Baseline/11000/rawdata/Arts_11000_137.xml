[[File:Antoine Watteau - Actors from the Comédie Française - WGA25475.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], {{Circa|1720}}.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who portrays a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a performance (also '''actress'''; [[#The term actress|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such" (Elam 1980, 110).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the [[theatre]] or in modern mediums such as [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]]. The analogous Greek term is {{wikt-lang|grc|ὑποκριτής|italic=yes}} ({{grc-transl|ὑποκριτής}}), literally "one who answers".&lt;ref name="hypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/actor?q=actor|title=Definition of actor}}''Hypokrites'' (related to our word for [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]]) also means, less often, "to answer" the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term ''hypocrisis'' ([[acting]]) (1994, 257, 265–267).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of [[acting]]—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental [[performance art]].

Formerly, in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], and the time of [[William Shakespeare]], only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/narrativelyricdrama.htm|title=narrative, lyric, drama|last=Neziroski |first=Lirim|year=2003|work=Theories of Media :: Keywords Glossary :: multimedia|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=For example, until the late 1600s, audiences were opposed to seeing women on stage, because of the belief stage performance reduced them to the status of showgirls and prostitutes. Even Shakespeare's plays were performed by boys dressed in drag.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-sj.org/pdfs/St-Dusinberre-web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Boys Becoming Women in Shakespeare’s Plays|author=JULIET DUSINBERRE|website=S-sj.org\accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term actress==
After 1660 in [[Kingdom of England|England]], when women first started to appear on stage, the terms ''actor'' or ''actress'' were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French {{wikt-lang|fr|actrice}}, ''actress'' became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The [[etymology]] is a simple derivation from ''actor'' with {{Wikt-lang|en|-ess}} added.&lt;ref name="OED2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=3|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=actress, n.|quote=Although ''actor'' refers to a person who acts regardless of gender, where this term "is increasingly preferred", actress remains in general use; actor is increasingly preferred for performers of both sexes as a gender-neutral term.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, ''actors'' is preferred.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/sep/25/readers-editor-actor-or-actress|title=The readers' editor on... Actor or actress?|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Actor'' is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.

Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the [[post-war]] period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed.&lt;ref name="De GayGoodman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Lizbeth|authorlink1=Lizbeth Goodman|last2=Holledge|first2=Julie|title=The Routledge reader in gender and performance|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-16583-0|pages=8; 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated "Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The guide's authors stated that "actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men)." (See ''[[male as norm]]''). "As [[Whoopi Goldberg]] put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The UK performers' union [[Equity (British trade union)|Equity]] has no policy on the use of "actor" or "actress". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the "...subject divides the profession".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Actress" remains the common term used in major [[acting]] awards given to female recipients&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/18/entertainment/ca-actress18|title=From actor to actress and back again|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=18 January 2009 |work=Entertainment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=It would be several decades before the word "actress" appeared – 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word "actor" was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding "player."}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]).

With regard to the [[cinema of the United States]], the gender-neutral term "player" was common in film in the [[silent film]] era and the early days of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed [[archaism|archaic]]. However, "player" remains in use in the [[theatre]], often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the [[American Players Theatre|American Players]], the [[East West Players]], etc. Also, actors in [[improvisational theatre]] may be referred to as "players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spolin|first1=Viola|title=Improvisation for the Theater: A Handbook of Teaching and Directing Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Northwestern Univ Press|location=Evanston, Ill|ISBN=0810140004|pages=Introduction to the 3rd Edition|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improvisation-for-the-theater-a-handbook-of-teaching-and-directing-techniques/oclc/41176682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped onto the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in [[song]], dance, and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. The exclusively male actors in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] performed in three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt; Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]].

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and [[pagan]]. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. The [[Feast of Fools]] encouraged the development of comedy. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] often contained [[comedy]], with actors playing [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.

There were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.

[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the [[mystery plays]], "[[morality play]]s", and the "university drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan stage]].

The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when [[Puritan]] opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.

===19th century===
[[File:Henry Irving Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|Henry Irving in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', 1874.]]

In the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wilmeth, Don B. |author2=Bigsby, C.W.E. | title=The Cambridge history of American theatre | year=1998 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-0-521-65179-0 | pages=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite "stars". A new role emerged for the [[actor-manager]]s, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing.&lt;ref&gt;James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian era'' (2004) 1:2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. [[Henry Irving]] (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.&lt;ref&gt;George Rowell, ''Theatre in the Age of Irving'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22Xp03gBd-MC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:The_Shubert_Theatre00.jpg|border|right|frameless]]
By the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as [[Stage management|stage managers]] and later [[theatre director]]s emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], [[Edward Laurillard]], and especially [[The Shubert Organization]]. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.&lt;ref&gt;Foster Hirsch, ''The Boys from Syracuse: The Shuberts' Theatrical Empire'' (Cooper Square Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|List of acting techniques}}
* [[Classical acting]] is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. 
* In [[Stanislavski's system]], also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the "truth" of the character they portray. Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character, finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character.
* [[Method acting]] is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of [[Stella Adler]] and [[Sanford Meisner]], but these are not considered "method acting".&lt;ref&gt;Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) [https://tribecafilminstitute.org/blog/detail/what_it_means_to_be_method What It Means To Be ‘Method’]. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meisner technique]] requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system.

==As opposite sex==
Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_52_fri_04.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 4 - Woman's Hour -Women Actors in Ancient Rome|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in [[Venice]]. In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"/&gt;

When an eighteen-year [[Puritan]] prohibition of [[Restoration drama|drama]] was lifted after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. [[Margaret Hughes]] is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1534673,00.html |title=Smallweed |last=Smallweed |date=23 July 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote="Whereas women's parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women ... we do permit and give leave for the time to come that all women's parts be acted by women," Charles II ordained in 1662. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the first actress to exploit this new freedom was Margaret Hughes, as Desdemona in Othello on December 8, 1660. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422150043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0%2C%2C1534673%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition ended during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/10/18/103638994.pdf |title=Women as actresses |date=18 October 1885 |work=Notes and Queries |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote=There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage. Charles II, must have brought the usage from the Continent, where women had long been employed instead of boys or youths in the representation of female characters. |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120210/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/10/18/103638994.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Charles II issued [[letters patent]] to [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]], granting them the [[monopoly]] right to form two London theatre companies to perform "serious" drama, and the letters patent were reissued in 1662 with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborah Payne (2001). "The Restoration Actress". In Owen, Susan J. ''A companion to restoration drama'', pg. 73, (1. publ. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631219231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term ''actress'' was in 1608 according to the [[OED]] and is ascribed to [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]]. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often [[courtesans]] and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting "stars", most notably [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Studies in hysteria’: actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], ''[[onnagata]]'', men taking on female roles, were used in ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the [[Edo period]]. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] drama involve women playing all roles.

In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of [[Peter Pan]] is traditionally played by a woman, as are most [[principal boy]]s in British [[pantomime]]. [[Opera]] has several "[[breeches role]]s" traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s. Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, [[Stina Ekblad]] played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'', and [[Linda Hunt]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Billy Kwan in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. In 2007, [[Cate Blanchett]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 1960s, in ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in [[comic theatre]] and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt [[cross-dressing]], such as [[Francis Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The movie ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' stars [[Jack Gilford]] dressing as a young bride. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the [[Carry On films]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] have each appeared in a hit comedy film (''[[Tootsie]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.

Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', or [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. In ''[[It's Pat: The Movie]]'', filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]] and Chris (played by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Dave Foley]]). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.

A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' was played by [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 original film]], [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], and [[John Travolta]] in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 movie musical]]. [[Felicity Huffman]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing Bree Osbourne (a [[male-to-female transsexual]]) in 2005's ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''.

==Types==
Actors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.

===In theatre===
To act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as "Stage Left" and "Stage Right". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions "Upstage" (away from the audience) and "Downstage" (towards the audience)&lt;ref name="sft.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title= Industry Tips |url=http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326100456/http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is "...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

Some theater actors need to learn [[stage combat]], which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by [[fight director]]s, who help them learn the [[choreography|choreographed sequence]] of fight actions.

===In film===
====Silent films====
From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were [[silent film]]s. Silent film actors emphasized [[body language]] and [[facial expression]], so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or [[camp (style)|campy]]. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. [[Vaudeville]] theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=American Film: A History|date=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97922-0|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pervading presence of [[stage actor]]s in film was the cause of this outburst from director [[Marshall Neilan]] in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures." In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.{{sfn|brownlow|1968|pages=344-353}}

Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as [[D W Griffith]], cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary [[close up]] shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company [[Biograph Studios]], became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/movies-flicks-film/film-acting-vs-theater-acting.html|title=Movies and Film|publisher=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian Gish]] has been called film's "first true actress" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between [[Stage acting|stage]] and [[screen acting]]. Directors such as [[Albert Capellani]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]] began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', were still being released. {{sfn|Brownlow|1968|pages=344–353}}

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the [[Weimar Republic]], "including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Silent Cinema|last = Kaes|first = Anton|date = 1990|journal = Monatshefte|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advent of sound in film====
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/auditions-for-film.html|title=Auditions for Film: Movie Acting Tips and Techniques|website=Ace-your-audition.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their "mark." This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on [[screen test]]s. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.

Unlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater." "The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt; Some theatre stars "...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully ([[Laurence Olivier]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Julie Andrews]], for instance), others have not..."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

===In television===
"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to learn to use lav mics ([[Lavaliere microphone]]s).&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to understand the concept of "frame". "The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt;
Within the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a ''series regular''—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in ''recurring'' roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A ''co-star'' role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A ''guest star'' is a larger role than a ''co-star'' role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.

===In radio===
[[File:Opname van een hoorspel Recording a radio play.jpg|thumb|Recording a radio play in the Netherlands (1949; [[Spaarnestad Photo]]).]]
Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic [[performance]], broadcast on [[radio]] or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio [[drama]] depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Crook: [http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf ''Radio drama. Theory and practice''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701103558/http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf |date=July 1, 2014 }}. London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR ([[old-time radio]]) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as [[Internet Archive]].

{{as of|2011}}, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or [[podcast]]s of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the [[BBC]] produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]]. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms "audio drama"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the entry to ''Hörspiel'' e.g. in: [http://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/H%C3%B6rspiel.html dict.cc – Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch]&lt;/ref&gt; or "audio theatre" are sometimes used synonymously with "radio drama" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on [[CD]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[webcast]]s and conventional broadcast radio.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | author = Newman, Barry |date = 2010-02-25 | title = Return With Us to the Thrilling Days Of Yesteryear — Via the Internet  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704240004575085313479028540 | publisher = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''American Art Directory''''' is a yearly publication covering [[art museum]]s, [[Arts centre|arts centers]], and [[Art school|art educational institutions]] as well as news, obituaries, book and magazine publications, etc. related to the artistic community in the [[United States]].  Established in 1898, it was originally entitled ''American Art Annual''.

Art consultant, advisor, author, and independent appraiser [[Alan Bamberger]] describes the Directory as "...a required reference for art museums, libraries, arts organizations, art schools, and corporations with art holdings."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A yearly feature is the "Review of the Year" article discussing the touring exhibitions, commissions, grants to organizations, construction starts at museums and other facilities, and various other events that occur within the art community.

Initially the directory was the work of the [[New York City|New York]] area artist [[Florence Nightingale Levy]] and published by [[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{Citation

[[File:The-Twa-Corbies.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] of the Scots ballad "[[The Twa Corbies]]"]]
A '''ballad''' {{IPAc-en|'|b|æ|l|ə|d}} is a form of verse, often a [[narrative]] set to [[music]]. Ballads derive from the medieval [[Music of France|French]] ''chanson balladée'' or ''[[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]'', which were originally "danced songs". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century. They were widely used across [[Europe]], and later in [[Australia]], [[North Africa]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines.

Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular [[love song]] and is often used for any love song, particularly the [[sentimental ballad]] of [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]].

==Origins==
[[File:Here begynneth a gest of Robyn Hode.png|thumb|upright|A sixteenth-century printed ballad, the [[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]]]
The ballad derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or "ballares" ([[Latin|L]]: ''ballare'', to dance),&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; from which 'ballet' is also derived, as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt; As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].&lt;ref name=Houseman1952&gt;J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Musically they were influenced by the [[Minnesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in [[England]] is "[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]" in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"&gt;A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that the two words, ballad and ballet, are both derived from the French language.

==Ballad form==
{{See also|AABA form}}
Ballads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Most northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"&gt;D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in this stanza from "[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]":

The '''horse''' | fair '''Ann''' | et '''rode''' | up'''on''' |&lt;br /&gt;
He '''amb''' | led '''like''' | the '''wind''' |,&lt;br /&gt;
With '''sil''' | ver '''he''' | was '''shod''' | be'''fore''',&lt;br /&gt;
With '''burn''' | ing '''gold''' | be'''hind''' |.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

There is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. [[Scotland]]'s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the [[Fairy]] Kingdom in the [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad "Tam Lin".&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', pp. 610-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Thomas Percy]] (1729–1811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"/&gt;

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"/&gt; Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/980|title=Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in Eighteenth-Century Britain {{!}} Reviews in History|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:Scott's Minstrelsy Of The Scottish Border.JPG|thumb|A copy of [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] ''The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''.]]
Scholars of ballads have been divided into "communalists", such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and "individualists" such as [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was one single original author.&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Finnegan, ''Oral Poetry: Its Nature, Significance and Social Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] argued a need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence'.&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of transmission on the English Ballads", ''Modern Language Review'' 11 (1916), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Classification==
[[File:Illustration to the ballad Young Beckie from "Some British Ballads".jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
{{See also|Child Ballads}}
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' indicates that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is [[Wynkyn de Worde|Wynkyn de Worde's]] collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.&lt;ref name=Sweers2005&gt;B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early collections of English ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st (1784), which paralleled the work in Scotland by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Burns]].&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt; Inspired by his reading as a teenager of ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' by [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. Burns collaborated with [[James Johnson (engraver)|James Johnson]] on the multi-volume ''[[Scots Musical Museum]]'', a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with [[George Thomson (musician)|George Thompson]] on ''[[A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice]]''.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=E. David |title=Victorian Songhunters: The Recovery and Editing of English Vernacular Ballads and Folk Lyrics, 1820-1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1tI8sPaqBwC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=August 30, 2017|date=April 13, 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-7417-7|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of [[Border ballads]], particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of "[[The Ballad of Chevy Chase]]" sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel [[Richard Sheale]].&lt;ref name="Gregory2006"&gt;D. Gregory, '"The Songs of the People for Me": The Victorian Rediscovery of Lancashire Vernacular Song', ''Canadian Folk Music/Musique folklorique canadienne'', 40 (2006), pp. 12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ganev,''Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in 18th Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use (at least in England) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enterprise.gre.ac.uk/news/articles/2011/gmi-ballads-talk]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}}

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by [[Svend Grundtvig]] and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor [[Francis James Child]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad," ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadsides===
{{Main article|Broadside (music)}}
[[File:Tragical Ballad 18th century.png|right|thumb|An 18th-century broadside ballad: ''The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man''.]]
Broadside ballads (also known as 'broadsheet', 'stall', 'vulgar' or 'come all ye' ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nebeker, [http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/page/heyday-of-the-broadside-ballad "The Heyday of the Broadside Ballad"], ''English Broadside Ballad Archive, University of California-Santa Barbara'', retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as "slip songs." Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or "chapbooks" which often drew on ballad stories.&lt;ref&gt;G. Newman and L. E. Brown, ''Britain in the Hanoverian Age, 1714–1837: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety, 1550-1640'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sold by travelling [[chapmen]] in city streets or at fairs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Spufford, ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, marriage, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' in 1798 that included Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling's "[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]" (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poet [[Christina Rossetti]] used ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues and to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Ballad operas==
{{Main article|Ballad opera}}
[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]
In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50485/ballad-opera "Ballad opera"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]] ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas d'Urfey]] (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe|Isaac Bickerstaffe's]] ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' as well as in the modern musical.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Bertolt Brecht's]] (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century "British" Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy|Peter Bellamy's]] ''The Transports'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Aby and P. Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lehrman, ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-bibliography'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Europe==

===Native American ballads===
[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] outside the town of Talcott in [[Summers County, West Virginia]]]]
Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]).&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include '[[The Streets of Laredo]]', which was found in Britain and Ireland as 'The Unfortunate Rake'; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, '[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]' and '[[Jesse James (folk song)|Jesse James]]'.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by [[George Malcolm Laws]], although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt;

===Blues ballads===
{{Main article|Blues ballad}}
The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt; The most famous blues ballads include those about [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Casey Jones]].&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt;

===Bush ballads===
{{Main article|Bush ballad}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentimental ballads==
{{Main article|Sentimental ballad}}
Sentimental ballads, sometimes called "tear-jerkers" or "drawing-room ballads" owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early "[[Tin Pan Alley]]" music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed). Such songs include "Little Rosewood Casket" (1870), "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" (1892) and "[[Danny Boy]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; The association with sentimentality led to the term "ballad" being used for slow [[love song]]s from the 1950s onwards. Modern variations include "[[jazz ballads]]", "[[pop ballads]]", "[[R&amp;B ballads]]" and "[[power ballads]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005p297&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barack Obama "Hope" poster''' is an image of [[Barack Obama]] designed by artist [[Shepard Fairey]], which was widely described as iconic and came to represent his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Pasick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|title=Iconic Obama poster based on Reuters photo|last=Pasick|first=Adam|date=January 15, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=January 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032224/http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|archivedate=January 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7872253.stm Copyright battle over Obama image]", BBC News, February 5, 2009. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a stylized [[stencil]] portrait of Obama in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word "progress", "hope" or "change" below (and other  words in some versions).

The design was created in one day and printed first as a poster. Fairey sold 290 of the posters on the street immediately after printing them. It was then more widely distributed&amp;mdash;both as a digital image and other paraphernalia&amp;mdash;during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election season]], initially independently but with the approval of the official Obama campaign.  The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Laura Barton]] to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of [[Che Guevara (photo)#Jim Fitzpatrick|Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster]], and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/10/barackobama-usa Hope - the Image that is Already an American Classic] by Laura Barton, ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's [[mixed-media]] stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for its [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].  Later in January 2009, the photograph on which Fairey based the poster was revealed: a June 2006 shot by former [[Associated Press]] freelance photographer [[Mannie Garcia]].  In response to claims by the [[Associated Press]] for compensation, Fairey sued for a [[declaratory judgment]] that his poster was a [[fair use]] of the original photograph. The parties settled out of court in January 2011, with details of the settlement remaining confidential.

On February 29, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty in a New York federal court to destroying and fabricating documents during his legal battle with the Associated Press. Fairey had sued the news service in 2008 after it claimed that the famous poster was based on one of its photos. Fairey claimed that he used a different photograph for the poster. But he admitted that, in fact, he was wrong and tried to hide the error by destroying documents and manufacturing others, which is the source of the one count of criminal contempt to which he pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/creator-of-popular-obama-hope-poster-pleads-to-criminal-contempt-charge-in-nyc/2012/02/24/gIQAoEH3XR_story.html|title=- The Washington Post|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Fairey was sentenced to two years of [[probation]], 300 hours of [[community service]], and a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-shepard-fairey-20120908,0,6021274.story|title=Shepard Fairey sentenced to probation, fine in Obama 'Hope' case|author=David Ng|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 8, 2012|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Fairey's Obama portrait was featured in the book ''[[Art For Obama: Designing Manifest Hope and the Campaign for Change]]'' which Fairey also edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-09-11/columns/yosi-sergant-and-the-art-of-change-the-publicist-behind-shepard-fairey-39-s-obama-hope-posters/|title=Yosi Sergant and the Art of Change: The Publicist Behind Shepard Fairey's Obama Hope Posters|first=Seven|last=Mcdonald|date=September 10, 2008|website=laweekly.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obeygiant.com/headlines/art-for-obama-book Obeythegiant.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 2015 Fairey said that Obama had not lived up, "not even close," to his expectations. He continued, "Obama has had a really tough time, but there have been a lot of things that he's compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a35288/shepard-fairey-street-art-obama-hope-poster/|title=Fairey: Obama Didn't Live Up to My 'Hope' Poster|author=|date=May 28, 2015|website=esquire.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and design ==
[[Shepard Fairey]], who had created earlier political [[street art]] critical of government and of [[George W. Bush]], discussed the nascent Obama campaign with publicist [[Yosi Sergant]] in late October 2007.  Sergant suggested Fairey create some art in support of Obama.  Sergant contacted the Obama campaign to seek its permission for Fairey to design an Obama poster, which was granted a few weeks before [[Super Tuesday]]. Fairey has said that his decision to create a portrait of Obama stemmed from Fairey's feeling that Obama's "power and sincerity as a speaker would create a positive association with his likeness."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt; Fairey found a photograph of Obama using [[Google Image Search]] (eventually revealed to be an April 2006 photo by freelancer [[Mannie Garcia]] for The [[Associated Press]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/manniegarcia/iWeb/mannie%20garcia/Hope.html Mannie Garcia] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gralish2"/&gt; and created the original poster design in a single day.  The original image had the word "{{smallcaps|progress}}" and featured Fairey's signature {{smallcaps|obey}} star&amp;mdash;a symbol associated with his ''[[Andre the Giant Has a Posse]]'' street art campaign&amp;mdash;embedded in the Obama campaign's [[Obama logo|sunrise logo]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Ben Arnon, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-arnon/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874.html How the Obama "Hope" Poster Reached a Tipping Point and Became a Cultural Phenomenon: An Interview With the Artist Shepard Fairey]", ''[[Huffington Post]]'', October 13, 2009. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Obama campaign's concerns about the troublesome connotations of the original wording, Fairey changed the slogan printed under Obama's image from "{{smallcaps|progress}}" to "{{smallcaps|hope}}."&lt;ref name=JOLT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher III|first=William W. |author2=Frank Cost |author3=Shepard Fairey |author4=Meir Feder |author5=Edwin Fountain |author6=Geoffrey Stewart |author7=Marita Sturken|title=Reflections on the Hope Poster Case|journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Technology|date=Spring 2012|volume=25|issue=2|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech243.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to design writer [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], the poster was inspired by [[Social Realism]] and, while widely praised as original and unique, can be seen as part of a long tradition of contemporary artists drawing inspiration from political candidates and producing "posters that break the mold not only in terms of color and style but also in message and tone."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heller, "[http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/shepard-fairey/ Beyond Red, White and Blue]", ''Campaign Stops Blog'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 15, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey has said, "My historical inspiration was the well-known JFK portrait where he is posed in a three-quarters view looking slightly upward and out into the distance. The image of Lincoln on the five-dollar bill has a similar feel."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

==Distribution during the 2008 campaign==
Fairey began [[screen-printing]] posters soon after completing the design and showing it to Yosi Sergant. Initially, he sold 350 and put 350 more up in public. Beginning with that sale and continuing throughout the campaign, Fairey used proceeds from selling the image to produce more of it; after first printing, he made 4,000 more that were distributed at Obama rallies before [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]]. He also put a printable digital version on his website. As Fairey explained in an October 2008 interview, the image quickly [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]], spreading spontaneously through [[social media]] and [[word of mouth]].&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

After the initial 700 posters, the Obama campaign conveyed through Sergant that they wanted to promote the theme of ''hope'', and most of the posters sold by Fairey subsequently had the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" and later "{{smallcaps|change}}" instead of "{{smallcaps|progress}}"; the {{smallcaps|obey}} star was also absent from later versions. By October 2008, Fairey and Sergant claimed to have printed 300,000 posters (with less than 2,000 sold and the rest given away or displayed) and 1,000,000 stickers, as well as clothing and other items with the image sold through Fairey's website, in addition to copies printed by others.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Booth, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/style/features/2008/obama-poster-051808/graphic.html Street Artist Fairey Gives Obama a Line of Cred], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 18, 2008. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fairey and Sergant, proceeds from sales of the image were used to produce more posters and other merchandise in support of the Obama campaign, rather than direct profit for Fairey.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

==Parodies and imitations==
As the campaign progressed, many [[parody|parodies]] and imitations of Fairey's design appeared.  For example, one anti-Obama version replaced the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" with "{{smallcaps|hype}}", while parody posters featuring opponents [[Sarah Palin]] and [[John McCain]] had the word "{{smallcaps|nope}}".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Linthicum, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/09/nation/na-trailfairey9 Artist’s Obama poster spawns wave of parodies]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 8, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009 ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine launched a site allowing users to create their own versions of the poster.  More than 10,000 images were uploaded to the site in its first two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |title=How you, too, can look and talk like Obama |work=The Star| location=Toronto | deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023010407/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |archive-date=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/paste-s-obama-site-surpasses-magazine-s-online-traffic-less-week|title=Paste’s Obama Site Surpasses Magazine’s Online Traffic in Less Than a Week - Folio:|author=|date=January 19, 2009|website=foliomag.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/make-your-own-o.html|title=ABC News|author=|date=|website=abcnews.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the "{{smallcaps|hope}}" poster with an "[[Alfred E. Neuman]] for President!" poster. Alfred was on the poster, and the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" was replaced with "{{smallcaps|hopeless}}". Anti-Gaddafi protesters in Chicago, in solidarity with the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], have co-opted the image.
[[Dynamite Comics]] released a four-part crossover with Obama and [[Ash Williams]] of their ''[[Army of Darkness (comics)|Army of Darkness]]'' comics and the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' films. One of the issues covers had a picture of Ash Williams (played by [[Bruce Campbell]] in the films) in the style of the "Hope" poster with the bottom text reading "Hope?"

Fairey was also commissioned to create a number of works in the same style. He produced two other versions, based on different photographs, officially on behalf of the Obama campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Powers, "[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Shepard+Fairey%3A+Purveyor+of+Hope/ Shepard Fairey: Purveyor of Hope]", ''[[SuicideGirls]]'', December 12, 2008.

Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a portrait of comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] in the same style, which appeared in an issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' honoring Colbert's television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert, "[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215976/january-15-2009/shepard-fairey Shepard Fairey]", ''The Colbert Report'', January 15, 2009.

Conservative satire site The People's Cube made visual and verbal punning images, such as "Chaos" with an image of [[Rush Limbaugh]] ("Operation Chaos"), "Shrugged" with an image of [[Ayn Rand]] (for her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'') and "Marxism" with an image of [[Groucho Marx]].

The September 2009 issue of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', America's oldest-continuing [[LGBT]] publication, featured a cover image similar to Fairey's design.  The blue and red coloring was replaced with pink and purple, but instead of "{{smallcaps|hope}}", the caption was "{{smallcaps|nope?}}".&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm | title=Obama: Letting down gay supporters? | last=Mirchandani | first=Rajesh | authorlink=Rajesh Mirchandani | date=October 10, 2009 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091013081840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm| archivedate= October 13, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jon Barrett, the magazine's [[editor-in-chief]], said the cover expressed the frustration among some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of the [[Gay community|LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt;

The poster has also been parodied in popular culture. In the [[Futurama]] episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]," a similar poster of President [[Richard Nixon]] can be seen, with the slogan "DESPAIR". In the 2010 movie ''[[Megamind]]'', a version of the poster can be seen using Megamind's visage and the caption "NO YOU CAN'T", parodying Obama's campaign slogan "[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Slogan|Yes we can]]". [[Disney]]'s animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' has two episodes, "Nerds of a Feather" and "She's the Mayor", both with Obama's poster parodied with [[Candace Flynn|Candace's]] face. American heavy metal band [[Five Finger Death Punch]] has released a version with their mascot and the words "WAR", referring to their album ''[[War Is The Answer]]''.  In ''[[Iron Man 2]],'' [[Tony Stark]] receives a similar poster of the [[Iron Man]] armor and hangs it in his Malibu garage, much to the displeasure of his assistant and love interest [[Pepper Potts]]. The 4th season of ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' features Mr. Peanutbutter's version of the poster as he's running for governor.

[[File:Shepard Fairey Occupy Poster.jpg|left|thumb|Fairey's 2011 adaptation for the [[occupy movement]]]]
Sympathizing with the [[Occupy movement]], in November 2011 [[Shepard Fairey]] introduced a variation of his "Hope" poster. In the new poster, he featured a [[Guy Fawkes mask]], and the message "Mister President, we HOPE you're on our side", with the word "HOPE" in large font and the rest of the sentence in small font. The Obama campaign logo on the right was replaced by a similar logo with the inscription "[[We are the 99%]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/shepard-fairey-asks-obama-to-support-occupy/2011/11/18/gIQAvzcQZN_blog.html|title=Shepard Fairey asks Obama to support Occupy|last=Bell|first=Melissa|date=November 20, 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2009, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] announced it had acquired Fairey's hand-finished [[collage]] ([[stencil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] on paper) version of the image (with the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}"), which the gallery said would go on display shortly before [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|Obama's inauguration]] on January 20, 2009.  The work was commissioned and later donated by art collectors Heather and Tony Podesta (Tony is the brother of Obama's transition co-chairman [[John Podesta]]). It is an unusual acquisition, in that the National Portrait Gallery normally collects official portraits as presidents are leaving office rather than before they take office.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://face2face.si.edu/my_weblog/2009/01/npg-acquires-shepard-faireys-portrait-of-barack-obama.html NPG Acquires Shepard Fairey’s Portrait of Barack Obama]," National Portrait Gallery, January 7, 2009.

A judge urged a settlement, stating that AP would win the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/design/29arts-JUDGEURGESRE_BRF.html |date=May 29, 2010 |title=Judge Urges Resolution in Use of Obama Photo |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP and Shepard Fairey settled out of court in January 2011. In a press release, the AP announced that the AP and Fairey "agreed to work together going forward with the Hope image and share the rights to make the posters and merchandise bearing the Hope image and to collaborate on a series of images that Fairey will create based on AP photographs. The parties have agreed to additional financial terms that will remain confidential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_01122011a.html|title=AP and Shepard Fairey announce agreement in Obama poster case|date=January 12, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate criminal action, federal prosecutors suggested that Fairey should face prison time for the destruction of evidence in the case, with the government sentencing request stating that "[a] sentence without any term of imprisonment sends a terrible message to those who might commit the same sort of criminal conduct. Encouraging parties to game the civil litigation system [...] creates terrible incentives and subverts the truth-finding function of civil litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/shepard-fairey-sentencing-report-683412 |title=Feds Seek Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his sentence was ultimately limited to 300 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/shepard-fairey-dodges-prison-683412 |title=No Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist In Federal Contempt Case, Judge Rules |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barefoot''' is the most common term for the state of not wearing any [[footwear]].

Wearing footwear is an exclusively human characteristic, however some animals held by humans are also issued with footwear, such as horses and, more rarely dogs and cats. There are health benefits and some risks associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides protection from cuts, abrasions, bruises, and impacts from objects on the ground or the ground texture itself, as well as from [[frostbite|frost]] or [[Thermal burn|heat burns]],  and parasites like [[hookworm]] in extreme situations. However, shoes can limit the flexibility, strength, and mobility of the foot and can lead to higher incidences of flexible flat foot, bunions, hammer toe, and [[Morton's neuroma]]. Walking and running barefoot results in a more natural gait, allowing for a more rocking motion of the foot, eliminating the hard heel strike and therefore generating less collision force in the foot and lower leg.&lt;ref name="Lieberman_DE"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature08723| title = Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners| year = 2010| last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D.

There are many sports that are performed barefoot, most notably [[gymnastics]] and [[martial arts]], but also [[beach volleyball]], [[barefoot running]], [[barefoot hiking]], and [[barefoot waterskiing|water skiing]]. In modern language, someone who tends not to wear shoes in public or is participating in the aforementioned sports may be described as a '''barefooter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barefoot water skiing: an illustrated guide to learning and mastering the sport|year=1988|publisher=World Publications, Incorporated|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6I2WE5XWIQ8C&amp;q=barefooter&amp;dq=barefooter|author1=Scarpa, R |author2=Dorner, T. |isbn=978-0-944406-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallack|first=R.M.|title=Run for Life: The Anti-Aging, Anti-Injury, Super-Fitness Plan to Keep You Running to 100|year=2009|publisher=Sky Horse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-344-8|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pkjcENkpO6cC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=barefooter#v=onepage&amp;q=barefooter&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in ancient times, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hindu]]s, and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] often went barefoot, as the inhabited terrain mostly mandated no practical necessity for footwear.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless [[sandal]] known as a ''Cleopatra'', which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. Athletes in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] participated barefoot and generally unclothed.&lt;ref name="ancient_olympics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unearthing the First Spartan Boys where not allowed to wear shoes to toughen their feet and allow stronger dexterity in their toes Olympics|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728000414/http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|archivedate=2010-07-28|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who eventually conquered the Greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture, did not adopt the Greek perception of footwear and clothing. [[Clothing in ancient Rome|Roman clothing]] explicitly including footwear was seen as a sign of power and as a necessity of living in a civilized world; accordingly slaves usually were to remain barefoot.&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazine|first=Richard Keith|title=The Barefoot Hiker|year=1993|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-525-8|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/?id=edsITVCd2G0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=barefoot+hiker&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many references to shoes being worn in the [[Bible]]. During weddings of this period, a father would give his son-in-law a pair of shoes to symbolize the transfer of authority.&lt;ref name="ancient_weddings"&gt;{{cite web|title=77 Interesting Facts About Weddings|url=http://facts.randomhistory.com/interesting-facts-about-weddings.html|publisher=randomhistory.com|accessdate=July 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100723234251/http://facts.randomhistory.com/interesting-facts-about-weddings.html| archivedate= 23 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]] in Europe, commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern [[high-heeled footwear|high-heeled shoe]],&lt;ref name="high_heels"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangerous Elegance: A History of High-Heeled Shoes|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/036heels.html|publisher=randomhistory.com|accessdate=July 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728002338/http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/036heels.html| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while menial classes usually wore hand-made footwear out of available materials. Going barefoot was seen as a marker of poverty and the lowest social class, as well as being the mark of a prisoner (see below).&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"/&gt; In the 15th century, [[chopine]]s were created in [[Turkey]] and were usually 7–8&amp;nbsp;inches (17.7–20.3&amp;nbsp;cm) high. These shoes became popular in [[Venice]] and throughout Europe as a [[status symbol]] revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century royalty, such as [[Catherine de Medici]] and [[Mary I of England]], started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as "well-heeled".&lt;ref name="high_heels"/&gt;

The phrase ''[[barefoot and pregnant]]'' is now used to illustrate a woman's traditional role as a [[homemaker]] and thus her lack of opportunities to socialize or to have a career outside of the home.&lt;ref name="barefoot_and_pregnant"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Ruth I.|title=Ozarks Women: Ignorant, Barefoot, and Pregnant?|url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/V9/N8/s87c.htm|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=West River Valley Historical Quarterly|date=December 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in the early 20th century, possibly by Arthur E.

Bare feet have come to symbolize innocence or childhood in a glorifying perception of freedom from real-life requirements. The connection to childhood and innocence, as well as the simple joys of country life, are embodied in the poem "[[The Barefoot Boy]]" by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], published in 1855.&lt;ref name="Whittier_John"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravitch|first=Diane|title=The American reader: words that moved a nation| year=2000| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=0-06-273733-3| pages=140–43| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZhJQCsOCgGgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=the+barefoot+boy+by+john+greenleaf+whittier&amp;q=the%20barefoot%20boy%20by%20john%20greenleaf%20whittier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book ''[[Dancing Barefoot (book)|Dancing Barefoot]]'' by ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' actor [[Wil Wheaton]] features five short stories that chronicle his journey from childhood and youth through to maturity and self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Wheaton_Wil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheaton|first=Wil|title=Dancing Barefoot|year=2004|publisher=Monolith Press|isbn=0-596-00674-8|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gDG67vii624C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dancing+barefoot&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In most religions, the exposure of bare feet is regarded as a sign of humility and subjection. Some religious practitioners have taken a vow of Gospel poverty, while there are certain convents where going barefoot is obligatory ([[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]], [[Poor Clares]], [[Colettine Poor Clares]]). With regard to the use of footwear as a display of status, the religious and common art of many cultures throughout the world shows a person without shoes symbolizing either extreme poverty or the state of captivity and unfree servitude.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|year=2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=barefoot+middle+ages&amp;q=barefoot%20middle%20ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]], Master Jinshen, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, walks {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} per day barefoot as a reminder to others who pursue a material life to protect and be concerned for [[Mother Nature]]. He states that he does this to follow Buddhist rules, to lead the people to the path of virtue, and to develop his Buddhist spirit.&lt;ref name="Buddhist_Monk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lin|first=You Hsueh|title=Thai monk walks million miles on barefoot|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20100213-198496.html|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[Asia One News]]|date=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary in Judaism and some Christian denominations to go barefoot while mourning.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Some Christian churches practice barefoot [[pilgrimage]] traditions, such as the ascent of [[Croagh Patrick]] in Ireland at night while barefoot (although the nighttime part is no longer encouraged).&lt;ref name="Castlebar_News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayo Mountain Rescue Team appeal to pilgrims for safety on holy mountain|url=http://www.castlebar.ie/news/article_2671.shtml|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=Castlebar News|date=July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many religions, it is common to remove shoes when entering a place considered holy. For example, in the [[Book of Exodus]], [[Moses]] was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:

{{cquote|Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground ({{bibleverse|Exodus|3:5|KJV}}).}}

Anyone entering a [[mosque]] or a [[Hindu temple]], including a visitor, is expected to remove his or her shoes; racks for the storage of shoes are usually provided at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/a/mosque-dos-and-donts.htm|title=Mosque etiquette|work=Southeast Asia travel|publisher=about.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html|title=Worship in Hindu temples|publisher=pujaonline|accessdate=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625094917/http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html#|archive-date=2012-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foot washing]], or ceremonial washing of others' feet, is associated with humility in Christianity, and Jesus Christ is recorded in the [[New Testament]] as washing the feet of his disciples to serve them during the [[Last Supper]]. Christians who practice foot washing today do so to bring them closer to Jesus and to fill them with a sense of humility and service. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] show their respect and humility for the [[Pope]] by kissing his feet. In a similar manner, Hindus show love and respect to a [[guru]] by touching his bare feet (called [[pranam]]). It is customary to show one's respect by walking barefoot around [[Raj Ghat]], the monument to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Both United States President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] paid him this honor.&lt;ref name="Barefoot_Bush"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barefoot Bush pays tribute to Mahatma|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Barefoot-Bush-pays-tribute-to-Mahatma/articleshow/1436126.cms|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=March 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Imperial Japan]]ese period, removing one's shoes in the presence of a person of higher status was a sign of showing one's own humility, subordination, and respect towards their status.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;

Christian congregations of men and women that go entirely barefoot or wear sandals include the [[Discalced]], like the [[Discalced Carmelites]] (1568), the [[Congregation of the Feuillants|Feuillants]] ([[Cistercians]], 1575), the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]] (1594), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]] (1604), and the [[Passionist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many branches of [[Romani culture]] across the world, it is traditional for women to dance barefoot.

===Firewalking===
[[Firewalking]] is the practice of walking barefoot over hot coals. It has been practiced by many people and cultures in all parts of the world, with the earliest known reference dating back to [[Iron Age India]] – c. 1200 BC.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willey|first=David|title=Firewalking Myth vs Physics|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=June 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606040454/http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html| archivedate= 6 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a [[rite of passage]], as a test of an individual's strength and courage, or, in religion, as a test of one's faith. Today, it is often used in corporate and team-building seminars and self-help workshops as a confidence-building exercise. Firewalking implies the belief that the feat requires the aid of a supernatural force, strong faith, or on an individual's ability to focus on "mind over matter".&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Modern physics has largely debunked this, showing that the amount of time the foot is in contact with the ground is not enough to induce a burn, combined with the fact that [[coal]] is not a very good conductor of heat.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"/&gt;

==Barefoot customs by country==
{{globalize|date=June 2015}}

===Australia===
It is common for Australians, particularly young people, to be barefoot in public places, especially during summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/season-of-the-shoeless/story-e6frg8h6-1226732901337 |title=Season of the shoeless |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] launched a summer advertisement in 2012 featuring a customer running barefoot through the hot carpark to the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/11/mcdonalds-gets-set-for-summer.html |title=McDonald's gets set for summer with launch of 'Do Summer' campaign via DDB Sydney  |publisher=Campaignbrief.com Australia|date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural and remote areas, such as the [[Northern Territory]], Western NSW, regional Queensland and many islands, students often attend school barefoot. On [[Lord Howe Island]] the [[Lord Howe Island Board]] has described the fact pupils at the government-run Lord Howe Island Central School are allowed to attend school barefoot as a part of the "island lifestyle" and a "community asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhib.nsw.gov.au/sites/lordhowe/files/public/images/documents/lhib/Community/lhi%20community%20strategy%20final%20august%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lord Howe Island Community Strategy |publisher=Lhib.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In 2010, an American lecturer missed out on a job after criticising barefoot locals in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Emma |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3203837/Attack-on-shoeless-Kiwis-costs-lecturer-job |title=Attack on shoeless Kiwis costs lecturer job |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lecturer wrote barefoot locals were "not only backward and uncivilised, but dangerously unhygienic and repulsive to North Americans" in response to an article mocking a no shoes, no service policy in Texas.
In 2012, a travel writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote the number of New Zealanders barefoot in public, including shops was "striking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/striking-number-kiwis-walk-around-barefoot-ny-times-4835491|title='Striking' number of Kiwis walk around barefoot |last=|first=|date=April 16, 2012|website=tvnz.co.nz|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614055413/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/striking-number-kiwis-walk-around-barefoot-ny-times-4835491|archivedate=June 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many expats in New Zealand have been surprised how many people, of all races and classes, carry on daily business barefoot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccabe.net.nz/going-naked-barefoot-in-new-zealand/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528105136/http://mccabe.net.nz/going-naked-barefoot-in-new-zealand/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-05-28 |title=Going naked: barefoot in New Zealand |publisher=Mccabe.net.nz |date=2014-03-26 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being barefoot in public is more common during warmer months, and often accepted as a social norm, however this does not extend to metropolitan cities such as London, but more for rural areas and more common for young children and teenagers. Some British schools also allow children to attend school barefoot in warmer months, and encourage it for indoor and outdoor physical education lessons. The [[National Health Service]] has recommended that people "go barefoot or wear open-toed sandals whenever you can in the hot weather...to help stop your feet getting sweaty and smelly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/foothealth/Pages/Summerfeet.aspx |title=Summer feet tips  |publisher=Nhs.uk Choices|date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa barefoot walking in public is part of the predominantly white Afrikaans speaking culture, although English speaking people also often walk barefoot in public, especially in the summer months and in cities such as Cape Town.
The National Guidelines on School Uniform list shoes as an optional item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=8NYok1lRKBs%3D&amp;tabid=453&amp;mid=469 |title=Schedule : National Guidelines on School Uniform |publisher=Education.gov.za |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Draft Guidelines state "Pupils, especially in lower grades, should also
be permitted to attend without shoes in hot weather". Most children attend school barefoot. In many schools, the dress codes either encourage kids to attend school barefoot or prefer kids to attend school barefoot, especially in the summer months.
Some South African schools have sport uniforms where bare feet are compulsory, such as primary school rugby. Another sport where bare feet for kids are compulsory is "tou trek" or tug of war. Being barefoot in public is generally tolerated.  In South African shopping malls, stores, and events, it is not an uncommon sight to see barefoot adults, kids and especially teenagers and young adults.

=== United States ===
In some parts of the United States, where [[taboos]] against barefoot walking are strong, it is common for people to wear the same shoes indoors and outdoors, and for guests to keep their shoes on when visiting other people's houses. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Imprisonment and slavery ==

Removing the footwear and making a captive go barefoot has been one of the first conventional methods to tag and identify [[prisoner]]s in most civilizations. It was a usual feature and often the principle element of early [[prison uniform]]s. The visual aspect of bare feet is therefore used to contrast the conventional appearance as footwear is regarded an obligatory clothing feature in urbanized cultures.

Besides the indicatory aspect going in bare feet restricts the freedom of action in many situations. A barefooted person is therefore disadvantaged opposite a shod person in many practical respects. This aspect is often used to exercise physical control over individuals in captivity.

A barefoot person is usually disadvantaged in a physical confrontation against shod individuals. Drastically more severe injuries can be sustained especially by a kicking person outfitted with footwear in contrast to a person in bare feet. For this reason shoes are considered [[deadly weapon]]s by [[penal law]]s of most countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Bare feet on the other hand present an opportune and vulnerable target for the application of force. These effects are usually desired by correctional or police officers primarily in confrontational situations with antagonistic individuals. The risk of personal injury is therefore notably reduced and the situation can often be resolved more efficiently.

Another main objective is preventing and counteracting potential attempts of [[prison escape]].
Without the protection of the feet that shoes provide, the locomotion of an unshod person is more difficult in the majority of exterior environments, so a potential fugitive is easier to retrieve in many cases. Detainees are often discouraged from attempting escape by this measure alone.&lt;ref name="Tewksbury escape"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police capture man who escaped from Tewksbury police station.|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_18259469|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A barefoot person experiences certain discomfort in daily life situations. The desire to be protected from the common inconveniences of the ground, mostly due to coarse textures or adverse temperatures, prompted humans to make use of footwear in [[ancient history]]. Incidentally the traditional visual appearance of civilized societies was established, including footwear as an obligatory feature.
A forced exclusion from the conveniences and also appearance of footwear typically creates an frequent awareness of being vulnerable, therefore it can have an intimidating effect on a person. The enforcement of bare feet often creates a consciousness of being powerless and degraded notably on prisoners, as they typically cannot relieve this situation on their own.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=June 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the practical effects are typically achieved effortlessly, keeping captives or prisoners barefoot has been cross-culturally practiced since antiquity.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblical studies: Footwear.|url=https://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/stichwort/27353/|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also commonly practiced to identify [[slavery|slaves]] in former times.

===Slave codes===
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Barefooted oriental slaves (''Jean-Léon Gérôme – The Slave Market'')]]
[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Barefooted slaves in North America, 1780s]]

Since ancient times, it is a common practice in civil societies to wear footwear as a standard feature. In contrast to this convention, ''slave codes'' often decreed that slaves go barefoot. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/public_info/P/82884/3/|publisher=westerncape.gov.za|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot.&lt;ref name="slavery_brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil.|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To quote Brother Riemer (1779): "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted." &lt;ref name="living_conditions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living conditions of slaves.|url=http://surinamslavery.blogspot.com/2008/10/chapter-6-living-conditions-of-slaves.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoes have been regarded as badges of freedom and signs of empowerment since early human history, while going barefoot designated a rather low social rank, often having the status of an unfree person. Using the symbolic meaning of shoes to display a respectable social status and also being vested with authority, people have ceremonially been issued with footwear as is mentioned in the bible "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:22|KJV}})". Forcing individuals to go barefoot by taking away their shoes and disallowing or hindering them to be worn accordingly has the reversed meaning. While since ancient societies the standard form of appearance commonly includes footwear as an implicit feature, the imagery or bare feet is often used to indicate submission, subjugation or dependence, in certain contexts also being disarmed or disempowered. &lt;br&gt;Therefore, this detail has become an informal and sometimes even formal law in societies practicing slavery. A barefooted human could be unmistakably identified as unfree and be attributed with the lowest social status on the spot. As a consequence appearing barefooted in any social situation was proscribed for common citizens and strictly avoided. &lt;br&gt;In many US states this perception is prevalent to this day as everyday shoes are typically also worn in the private space and being barefooted is effectively placed under taboo (see [[Barefoot#Cultural aspects|above]]).

In certain societies this rule pertains to this day where slavery is still unofficially practiced. The [[Tuareg]] are known still to practice slavery and force their slaves to go barefoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Niger: Ehemalige Sklavin erhält Entschädigung |last=Scheen|first=Von Thomas|date=2008-10-31|website=faz.net|language=DE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031151116/http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|archive-date=2008-10-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
In several countries of the world [[prison]] inmates have to remain barefoot under regulatory constraint.
In history this was common practice in most civilizations as bare feet were commonly received as a characteristic of unfree individuals. It also marked the first means of visually marking [[prisoner]]s in terms of a [[prison uniform]].

This is current practice in [[China]],&lt;ref name="www.clearharmony.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearharmony.net/articles/The_Chinese_Prison_System_I_Know-a23068.html|title=The Chinese Prison System I Know|author=A Falun Dafa practitioner in Guangxi Province of China|work=clearharmony.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zimbabwe]],&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meldrum 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/12/pressandpublishing.observercampaignpressfreedom|title=My night in Mugabe's stinking jail|author=Andrew Meldrum|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/chatter/zimbabwes-jails-full-human-kindness|title=Zimbabwe's jails: full of human kindness?|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]],&lt;ref name="Meldrum 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phaseloop.com/foreignprisoners/case-steve_willcox01.html|title=Foreign Prisoners Support Service|work=phaseloop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/trip-inside-phuket-prison-photo-special/ |title=A Trip Inside Phuket Prison: Photo Special |publisher=Phuket Wan |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208131350/http://phuketwan.com/tourism/trip-inside-phuket-prison-photo-special/ |archive-date=2015-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatchesinternational.org/?p=66|title=Open Minds, Closed Doors: Prison Education in Uganda|work=DI News|access-date=2014-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084805/http://www.dispatchesinternational.org/?p=66|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/750184/Barefoot-prisoners-bury-Uganda-cult-bodies.html?pg=all|title=Barefoot prisoners bury Uganda cult bodies|date=20 March 2000|work=DeseretNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.byliner.com/robert-j-rosenthal/stories/inside-a-ugandan-prison-a-nightmare-comes-to-life|title=Inside a Ugandan Prison, a Nightmare Comes to Life|last=Rosenthal|first=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert Jon Rosenthal|date=January 1982|website=byliner.com|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007013357/http://byliner.com/robert-j-rosenthal/stories/inside-a-ugandan-prison-a-nightmare-comes-to-life|archivedate=October 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] it was common practice during the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]] to keep especially female prisoners uniformly barefoot. In particular camps the women also had to perform forced labor in their bare feet, at times even under adverse weather conditions. This was implemented as means to intimidate the detained individuals and dampen renitency as well as to reduce the expenses for clothing items. It was also part of the then prevalent practice in Nazi-Germany to victimize prisoners.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Women of Ravensbrück Concentration Camp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Rochelle G. |last=Saidel |title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbruck Concentration Camp |url=

Within women's penitentiaries in [[socialism|socialist]] [[East Germany]] (German Democratic Republic) especially [[political prisoner]]s who were regarded as opponents of the regime could have their footwear seized and be detained barefoot as an aggravation of their penalty.&lt;ref name="DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/familie/article1924314/Das-Unrecht-verfolgt-mich-bis-an-mein-Lebensende.html|title=DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck: 'Das Unrecht verfolgt mich – bis an mein Lebensende'  |author=Maggie Riepl|date=10 March 2012|work=Berliner Morgenpost |location= Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earmarking of captives by forcing them to go in bare feet was also practiced specifically on imprisoned women in parts of the United States until the early 20th century. It was then common practice by penal institutions particularly in [[Texas]] to exclude female prisoners from being issued with any kind of footwear, by this means keeping them barefoot throughout. Contrary to this measure adequate shoes were provided for male convicts as a matter of course. There were no apparent security motives for this unequal treatment; it was however practiced to point out the evident [[hierarchy]] between male and female detainees. The according structure of subordination of the female prisoners also towards the male convicts was therefore showcased in an evident and palpable way. It also conformed to the notion of the criminal courts, who widely saw prisoners as official slaves of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|title=Prisoners' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522040456/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|archive-date=2016-05-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this an [[analogy]] to actual former slaves was drawn, who were often forced to remain barefoot as well (see above). As going shoeless is placed under a more or less strict social taboo in most regions of the US (see above), being forced to go entirely barefoot determined the degradation to the lowest social rank for the incarcerated women. This arbitrary and victimizing measure was an apparent token for the general [[discrimination]] against incarcerated women, who unlike male prisoners did not have the right to claim legal remedies at that time.&lt;ref name="Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anne M. |last=Butler |title=Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4IdxKAdM8cC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |title= Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpSjVQ0u9zwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women in the American West"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gordon Moris Bakken |author2=Brenda Farrington |title=Encyclopedia of Women in the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9zIeyugktEC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present ISIS usually deprives their captives of footwear, presumably in order to identify them more readily and prevent escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestgore.com/execution/isis-video-truckloads-men-lead-to-slaughter-execution/|title=ISIS removes shoes of captives|work=smh.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bible there are multiple passages stating that a potent way to inflict humiliation on another human being lies in taking away his or her shoes and forcing the individual to go barefoot. Ritual customs therefore consisted of publicly taking away a disgraced person's shoes. This resulted in the individual being defamed as a "barefooter" culminating in the loss of social standing. On the other hand, taking off the shoes of one's own will and voluntarily exposing one's bare feet is regarded as a token of submission and humility by the bible. This included the subjection under higher powers as well as a mundane authority. Therefore, it was concluded to be imperative that prisoners or captives were to be kept barefoot and in light clothing as a token of their subjugation.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"/&gt;

===Inquisition and witch trials===
During the era of the Catholic [[Inquisition]] it was commonly believed that women practicing [[witchcraft]] had their ability to use sinister powers largely diminished if they were forced to remain barefoot. As a consequence first of all the just arrested woman routinely had her footwear taken away, ensuring that her feet remained unclothed at all events. Due to interpretations of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' it was believed that in case a witch was not strictly kept in her bare feet she could still cast a spell on people by just looking at them. As the prosecutors wanted to avoid any risk, it was seen to it that the bare feet of the accused woman were constantly visible, so to convince themselves at any moment.

During questioning or in court the accused women often had to stand on a consecrated spot with the soles of their bare feet touching the sanctified area. This was believed to completely inhibit any of their purported magic powers. Accordingly, the women were forbidden to look at the prosecutors when their bare feet were not strictly in place. To further ensure safety they were often lead in walking backwards when facing the prosecution. They were allowed to turn around only if their bare feet could clearly be seen to be within the bounded spot.
As the accused women naturally could not use any magic while they were tried, this assumption became an accepted doctrine.
Accordingly, contemporary depictions about inquisition proceedings or similar situations portray the tried women barefooted in almost every case.&lt;ref name=Memminger&gt;''Das verhexte Kloster: Nach den Akten dargestellt'' (trans. ''The bewitched cloister: portrayed according to official records'') by [[Anton Memminger]], published 1904. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporal punishment==
[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|Demonstration of "bastinado"]]
The [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of a person's bare feet also serve as a target for [[corporal punishment]], commonly referred to as "bastinado" ([[foot whipping]]). This method is mainly used in the context of penal functions and situations of detention or incarceration.

The practice of foot whipping is still officially employed in several [[Middle East]]ern nations where the term ''falaka'' is customary. In history, bastinado was frequently practiced in Western countries as well. Among others, it was commonly used in [[Germany|German]] territories, where it was employed until the end of the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]], mainly within the [[reformatory]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] system. In certain facilities it even continued to be used during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen|url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261|work=kurier.at| accessdate=2014-03-03|trans-title=Wimmersdorf: 270 blows on the soles of the feet|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Berichte_ueber_Folter_in_Kinder-Heim_auf_der_Hohen_Warte-Schwere_Vorwuerfe-Story-316489|title=Berichte über Folter in Kinder-Heim auf der Hohen Warte|work=krone.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rejali&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' von Darius Rejali.

The beatings usually aim at the muscular tissue within the vaults of the foot ([[longitudinal arch of the foot]]), omitting the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are highly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve endings]].

As bastinado causes substantial suffering for the victim while [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]] in rogue regimes as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' by Darius Rejali. pp. 275f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and entertainment==
Many singers and dancers perform on stage barefoot. The classical dance of [[Cambodia]] had its roots in the holy dances of the legendary seductresses (''[[apsaras]]'') of ancient Cambodia and attained its high point during the [[Angkor]] period in its interpretations of the Indian epics, especially the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Cambodian dancers were well-born women of the king's harem and danced barefoot, with the feet turned outwards and the legs slightly bent at the knee to cushion the movements of the upper body. The unimpeded movement of the foot was essential to the art. When the land was invaded by the Thai, the dancers were taken to the Thai court, where their art was adapted and continued to flourish.&lt;ref name="Cambodian_Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Colet, John|author2=Joshua Eliot|author3=Abigail Vertigan |year=2002 |title=Cambodian Handbook |publisher=Footprint |isbn=1-903471-40-0 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3nVUxKL29ZwC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambodia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Ian |year=2000 |title=Cambodia |publisher=Oxfam GB |isbn=0-85598-430-9 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bK11j2IdbC0C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barefoot dance movement of the early 20th century challenged the received laws of classical dance and the broader laws of social decorum. For decades, the bare foot had been perceived as obscene, and no matter how determined barefoot dancers were to validate their art with reference to spiritual, artistic, historic, and organic concepts, barefoot dancing was inextricably linked in the public mind with indecency and sexual taboo. In 1908, [[Maud Allan]] shocked and fascinated London theatre-goers with her barefoot dance of desire in ''Salome'', and scandalous tributes positioned her as the embodiment of lust. For many, barefoot dancing represented not only the freedom and horror of modern sexuality but the progress and decline of high culture.&lt;ref name="Benstock"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Benstock, Shari |editor2=Ferriss, Suzanne |year=2001 |title=Footnotes: On Shoes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-2870-4 |pages=276–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tUK8BP7OOJQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Footnotes:+On+Shoes&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isadora Duncan (grayscale).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] performing barefoot during her 1915–18 American tour]]
[[California]]n [[Isadora Duncan]] revolutionized dance in the Western world by jettisoning the [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and the [[pointe shoe]] of classical [[ballet]] and scandalized audiences by performing works of her own choreography in flowing draperies and bare feet. She anticipated the modern [[women's liberation movement]] by urging women to rid themselves of corsets and matrimony.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Maureen |year=2002 |title=I See America Dancing: Selected Readings, 1685–2000 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-06999-4|page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=powGjotbu9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=I+See+America+Dancing:+Selected+Readings,+1685-2000&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan divorced the bare foot from perceptions of obscenity and made a conscious effort to link barefoot dancing to ideals such as "nudity, childhood, the idyllic past, flowing lines, health, nobility, ease, freedom, simplicity, order, and harmony". She believed her utopian dance vision and program would ameliorate the perceived ills of modern life and restore the world to the imagined perfection of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Benstock" /&gt;

The 1954 film ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' tells the fictional story of Maria Vargas (portrayed by [[Ava Gardner]]), a Spanish [[cabaret]] dancer of simple origins who frequently went barefoot. She was cast in a movie by writer and director Harry Dawes (portrayed by [[Humphrey Bogart]]) and became a major star. In 1978, [[Ina Garten]] purchased a specialty food store in [[The Hamptons]] named ''[[Barefoot Contessa]]'', after the movie. She liked the name because it went well with her simple and elegant cooking style. She sold the store in 1999 and wrote her first book, ''The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'', which became one of the best-selling cookbooks of the year. She would go on to write more cookbooks and, in 2002, started production of a television show on the [[Food Network]], also named the ''Barefoot Contessa'', which continues to run.&lt;ref name="Ina_Garten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ina Garten (biography)|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html|publisher=[[Food Network]]|accessdate=July 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630134851/http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are risks and benefits associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides some protection from puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns as well as abrasions, bruises, heat burns, electrical shock, and [[frostbite]]—but studies of people who habitually walk barefoot have consistently found that these problems are minimal, with only about 0.89% of barefoot people having any kind of foot complaint linked to walking barefoot (including temporary conditions such as abrasions) or having the tops of the feet uncovered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Feet that have never worn shoes rarely exhibit problems such as bunions, corns, and "[[Flat feet|fallen arches]]",&lt;ref name="2300 children"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao UB, Joseph B |title=The influence of footwear on the prevalence of flat foot.

Walking barefoot results in a more natural gait.

A 2007 study examined 180 modern humans and compared their feet with 2,000-year-old skeletons. They concluded that, before the invention of shoes, humans overall had healthier feet.&lt;ref name="NYmag"/&gt; A 1991 study found that children who wore shoes were three times more likely to have [[flat feet]] than those who did not, and suggested that wearing shoes in early childhood can be detrimental to the longitudinal arch of the foot.&lt;ref name="2300 children" /&gt; Children who habitually go barefoot were found to have stronger feet, with better flexibility and mobility, fewer deformities like flat feet or toes that curve inwards, and fewer complaints.&lt;ref name="Angier_Natalie"&gt;{{cite news|last=Angier|first=Natalie|title=Which Shoes Are Best For Children?

Since there is no artificial protection of the bare foot, some of the possible issues include cuts, abrasions, bruises, or puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns, as well as poisonous plants, animals, or [[parasite]]s that can enter the body through the cuts on an injured bare foot.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staheli LT |title=Shoes for children: a review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=371–75 |year=1991 |pmid=1861942 |doi= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people who are not habitually barefoot, [[Athlete's foot]] is spread by fungal spores coming into contact with skin that has been weakened and made moist. The fungus is known to only affect around 0.75% of habitually barefoot people in one study and can be prevented by reducing shoe use and keeping the feet dry, particularly after walking through a damp environment where people communally walk barefoot as the fungus only develops under the right conditions, such as when people fail to properly dry their feet after swimming or showering and then put on shoes. Wearing shoes such as flip flops or sandals in these areas can reduce the risk.&lt;ref name="athletes_foot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Patricia|title=Athlete's Foot|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/health_problems/skin/athletes_foot.html|publisher=kidshealth.org|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the fungus is very unlikely to develop on a person who goes barefoot all the time.

The [[hookworm]] parasite, found only in warm, moist climates where human [[feces]] contaminated with hookworm larvae has been left in places where it might come into contact with human skin, can burrow through a bare human foot (or any part of the body that comes into contact with it).&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |title=Hookworm Infection |date=September 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000301095412/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |archivedate=March 1, 2000 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the parasite tends to occur mainly in mud and cesspools, its spread cannot be stopped by most standard shoes{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} since the larvae can penetrate fabric and small holes. The parasite may spread through contaminated material coming into contact with any part of the body, such as through flecks of mud splashing on an ankle or leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trop|first=Am J|title=Penetration by Infective Hookworm Larvae of the Materials Used in the Manufacture of Shoes|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/s1-9/1/79.citation|accessdate=26 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hookworm]] parasite is relatively mild, has few symptoms, and can pass completely unnoticed when the infestation level is low enough. Since the hookworm infection is very cheap and easy to treat, and since it requires infected feces to come into contact with human skin within a particular time period, eradicating hookworm is mainly a matter of hygiene (including the building of proper toilet and waste-disposal facilities) and mass-treatment. In very cold weather, shoes can provide thermal insulation, protecting against [[frostbite]].

Issues that can develop as a result of someone who has always worn shoes going barefoot include calf pain or [[Achilles tendinitis]] or [[plantar fasciitis]] due to shortening of the Achilles tendon and the foot being underdeveloped, due to regular use of shoes.

== Laws ==
In the United States, there have been myths that regulations require the wearing of footwear. In the United States, during the period of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement of the 1960s]], business establishments would deny admittance to barefoot [[hippie]]s arguing that health regulations required that shoes be worn.&lt;ref name="MillerJoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |title=Going barefoot |last=Miller |first=Joe |date=May 29, 2008 |work=[[The News and Observer]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602011040/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |archivedate=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a belief by many in nonexistent [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] or local health department regulations preventing people from going to stores, restaurants, and other establishments without shoes.

==Sports and recreation==
[[File:Blue leggings.jpg|thumb|right|A woman sitting in a library with her bare feet on a chair.]]
There are several recreational activities one can participate in while barefoot. Those involved in [[water sports]] such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[water polo]] almost always participate barefoot due to the difficulty of swimming with footwear.

Other common activities performed barefoot include yoga, pilates, [[hiking]], running, driving, water skiing, [[touch rugby]], [[soccer]], [[beach volleyball]], [[surfing]], [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]], [[gymnastics]], [[Slacklining]], and [[martial arts]]. [[Wrestling]] can be done barefoot. Although most modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestlers wear shoes, [[sumo wrestling]], [[Yağlı güreş]] (oil or "Turkish" wrestling), and [[mud wrestling]] are commonly done while barefoot. [[Fiji]]an wrestler [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]] of the WWE has wrestled barefoot as well.&lt;ref name="Traina_Jimmy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Traina |first=Jimmy |title=Favorite Wrestlers of All Time |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=June 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407185431/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football]] is not traditionally a barefoot sport, though several [[placekicker]]s have preferred to kick barefoot, including [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Rich Karlis]] of the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref name="Gehman_Jim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gehman|first=Jim|title=Where Are They Now: PK Tony Franklin|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Eagles]]|date=May 5, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100619135621/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521| archivedate= 19 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss_Irv"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Irv|title=Karlis a standout as barefoot kicker|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_11559948?source=bb|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools of thought involved in barefoot placekicking were that the lack of a shoe provided the kicker with a better "feel" for the ball and greater control over its trajectory. The second theory is that shoes and socks absorbed kinetic energy, and kicking flesh-to-leather created more [[torque]].&lt;ref name="Klosterman_Chuck"&gt;{{cite news|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=A brilliant idea!

===Hiking===
People of all ages all over the world can participate in barefoot hiking, gathering for walks through forest and hiking trails sans footwear. Barefoot hikers claim that they feel a sense of communion with the earth and enjoy the sheer pleasure of feeling more of the world with their feet.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Todras-Whitehill|first=Ethan|title=Footloose and Boot Free: Barefoot Hiking.|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/travel/escapes/22hike.html|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several clubs throughout North America practicing regular barefoot hikes, including the Barefoot Hikers of Minnesota, Seattle Barefoot Hikers, East Bay Barefoot Hikers, the Barefoot Hikers and Grass Walkers of Greater Kansas City, and the Barefoot Hikers of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LADailyNews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauly |first=Brett |title=Sole Survivors: New shoeless joes are hitting dusty trails around San Francisco Bay and beyond. |url=http://barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961029205731/http://www.barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 29, 1996 |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |date=March 21, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barefoot Hiking Groups|url=http://www.barefoothub.com/barefoot-hiking-groups/|website=The Barefoot Hub|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European nations, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, there are barefoot parks or walks.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barefoot_walk 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Wena Alun|title=Challenge senses on barefoot walk. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7955356.stm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barfuss_park"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Barefoot Parks in Europe.|url=http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm|publisher=barfusspark.info|accessdate=June 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605081950/http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parks are kept clean and maintained on a regular basis, so that barefoot hiking can be done in an environment suitable for people who are habitually shod. Barefoot parks usually include a lot of adventure stations, allowing visitors to experience the feeling of soil textures underfoot; to wade through rivers, mud, brooks, or ponds; and to exercise [[foot gymnastics]], [[Equilibrioception|balancing]], and climbing. The ''Barfußpfad'' (barefoot trail) at Bad Sobernheim in Germany attracts over 100,000 visitors annually and has seen approximately 1 million visitors since its inception in 1999.&lt;ref name="BadSobernheim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast eine Million Menschen.|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/region/bad-kreuznach-bad-sobernheim-kirn/vg-bad-sobernheim/sobernheim/7927509.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=Allgemeine Beitung |date=November 25, 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was first developed in the 19th century by [[Sebastian Kneipp]], one of the founders of the [[Naturopathy|Naturopathic medicine]] movement. He believed that applying your feet to a range of natural stimuli would have therapeutic benefits. This is related to the ancient practice of [[reflexology]], practiced in China for thousands of years for relaxation and to promote longevity.&lt;ref name="Wignall_Alice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wignall|first=Alice|title=Get your socks off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/25/healthandwellbeing.walkingholidays|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barefoot running can be dangerous, especially to runners who do not adequately prepare or give their feet time to adapt to the new style. Many injuries are possible, such as injuries to the [[Achilles tendon]] or [[plantar fascia]], or [[stress fracture]]s in the [[metatarsal]] bones or lower leg. Barefoot runners who do not prepare their bodies could provide, "a stimulus plan for podiatrists, orthopedists, and physical therapists."&lt;ref name="Carey_Art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey |first=Art |title=Well Being: Running barefoot has not-so-obvious hazards |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html |accessdate=July 2, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100702011452/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html| archivedate= 2 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position on barefoot running by the [[American Podiatric Medical Association]] states that there is not enough research on the immediate- and long-term benefits of the practice and that individuals should consult a podiatrist with a strong background in sports medicine to make an informed decision on all aspects of their running and training programs.&lt;ref name="APMA_statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=APMA Position Statement on Barefoot Running|url=http://www.apma.org/Media/position.cfm?ItemNumber=995|publisher=[[American Podiatric Medical Association]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative to barefoot running is to wear thin-soled shoes with minimal padding, such as [[moccasin]]s, [[plimsolls]], or [[huarache (running shoe)|huaraches]], which result in similar gait to going barefoot but protect the skin and keep dirt and water off.&lt;ref name="Hersher_Rebecca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Perfect Landing. |url=http://alumni.harvard.edu/stories/perfect-landing |accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[Harvard University]]|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to maintain optimum flexibility while providing a minimum amount of protection.

The '''Bernward Column''' ({{lang-de|Bernwardssäule}}) also known as the '''Christ Column''' ({{lang-de|Christussäule}}) is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] bronze column, made {{circa|1000}} for [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St. Michael's Church]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, and regarded as a masterpiece of [[Ottonian art]]. It was commissioned by  [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]], thirteenth bishop of Hildesheim. It depicts images from the life of [[Jesus]], arranged in a helix similar to [[Trajan's Column]]: it was originally topped with a cross or [[crucifix]]. During the 19th century, it was moved to a courtyard and later to [[Hildesheim Cathedral]]. During the restoration of the cathedral from 2010 to 2014, it was moved back to its original location in St. Michael's, but was returned to the Cathedral in August 2014.&lt;ref name="Column" /&gt;

== Original location and history ==
The Bernward Column was made for [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim]], the foundation and final resting place of Bishop Bernward. It initially stood in the east choir, behind the altar, with a triumphal cross. This location under the triumphal arch was proposed by Gallistl using the literary sources&lt;ref&gt;Lit. Gallistl (1993) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed in 2006 by excavations.&lt;ref&gt;"Grabungszeichnung Harenberg", in Christiane Segers-Glocke (ed.), ''St. Michael in Hildesheim: Forschungsergebnisse zur bauarchäologischen Untersuchung im Jahr 2006'', CW Niemeyer Buchverlage GmbH, Hameln 2008, Copyright: 2008 [[Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Denkmalpflege]] (= Arbeitshefte zur Denkmalpflege in Niedersachsen 34) {{ISBN|978-3-8271-8034-6}}: S. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a copper-coated marble column stood in front of the altar, whose stone came from the eastern Mediterranean and, according to later sources, was a gift from [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] to Bernward.

The altar was equated with the offering table in the forehall of the [[Temple of Solomon]], which also stood between two columns ([[Boaz and Jachin]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gallistl, ''Der Dom zu Hildesheim und sein Weltkulturerbe, Bernwardstür und Christussäule'', pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[wheel chandelier]], which was meant to have been a gift from Otto III to Bernward, hung above the Bernward Column until 1662, with a porphyry jug in the centre that was claimed to derive from the [[Wedding at Cana]]. This arrangement of a column topped with a cross, an altar and a wheel chandelier was modelled on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], which was also equated with the fore hall of the Temple of Solomon. Furthermore, the distance of roughly {{convert|42|m}} between the original location of the column and the grave of Bernward in the west crypt of St. Michael's matched the distance between the Rotunda of the Resurrection and [[Golgotha]] in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to the reports of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig Beseler, Hans Roggenkamp. ''Die Michaeliskirche in Hildesheim.'' Berlin 1954. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, during the chaos of the [[Reformation]] in Hildesheim, the cross on top of the column was removed by iconoclasts. It was melted down and recast as a cannon, suggesting that it was of considerable size. After the demolition of the east choir of St. Michael's in 1650 and the resulting collapse of the east [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]], the column's [[capital (architecture)|capital]], which "weighed about a hundred pounds", was also melted down and replaced by a wooden capital of identical shape and size, meant to hide the replacement. An engraving by Johann Ludwig Brandes (1730) indicates that it was decorated with figures. Since figural capitals of this kind are otherwise only attested from the twelfth century, it has been suggested that the capital that was melted down was not the Bernwardian original either, and that this original was replaced during the renovation of the cloister church in the second half of the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lit. Olchawa (2008) S. 70 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the column was not melted down in the following years (despite its value as raw material) because of its ancient significance as a [[contact relic]], since it was believed to have been made personally by St. Bernward.

In 1810, after the [[German mediatization|secularisation]] of the Catholic cloister (1803) and the abolition of the Protestant parish of St. Michael's (1810), the column was removed on the private initiative of diocese officials and installed in the north of the [[Domhof, Hildesheim|Domhof]] between the cathedral and the Bishop's house. In 1870 the Hildesheim sculptor [[Karl Küsthardt]] gave the column a new bronze capital, which was meant to imitate the wooden capital or an illustration of it and to indirectly preserve the appearance of the old bronze capital, which had supported an [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] topped by a bronze crucifix. In 1893 it was moved into the cathedral.

On 30 September 2009 it was moved back to St. Michael's for the duration of the cathedral renovations, which lasted until August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dom-hildesheim.de/en/content/ancient-world-heritage-new-light "ANCIENT WORLD HERITAGE IN A NEW LIGHT"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Bernward column, which is {{convert|3.79|m}} high and {{convert|58|cm}} in diameter, is a [[Victory column]] that Bernward had cast from bronze in conscious imitation of the marble [[Trajan's Column]] and the [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] in [[Rome]]. Just as those stone columns depict the military deeds of the Emperor in an upward spiralling frieze, so the Bernward column depicts the peaceful deeds of Christ, beginning with his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] at the [[Jordan]] and ending with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]. The column was originally crowned with a [[triumphal cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domsanierung.de/de/bernwards%C3%A4ule-christuss%C3%A4ule Bernwardsäule (Christussäule)] domsanierung.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrhardt"&gt;[http://www.alfred-ehrhardt-stiftung.de/index.php?alfred-ehrhardt-the-bernward-column-of-hildesheim-photography-and-film-1964 Alfred Ehrhardt: The Bernward Column of Hildesheim. / Photography and film 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXS0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 Medieval Treasures from Hildesheim]'' Yale University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The column is significant for the vitality of the figural relief, which is unusual for the time. The relief complements the [[Bernward Doors]], which picture the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and [[resurrection]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ehrhardt" /&gt; Both artworks, like the rest of Bernward's artistic and architectural programme, reflect his efforts to put his seat in the position of a northern Rome in the context of the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s renewed Christian Roman Empire and also to emphasise Christ as a model of just and godly kingship for the rulers. For this reason, the execution of [[John the Baptist]] by the weak and unjust king [[Herod Antipas]] is given a great deal of space.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Liturgical significance ==
An important indicator of the liturgical significance of the Bernward column is its original location on the central axis of St. Michael's near the altar since that is where communion was distributed and the sacrament was stored. In the reliefs the importance of the gospels on [[Palm Sunday]] is emphasised, which might be connected with the [[Cluniac reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Olchawa 2008. S. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--!?--&gt; The references to the Lenten and penitential rites, which are also found in the imagery of the Bernward Doors, support this.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Gallistl, "In Faciem Angelici Templi. Kultgeschichtliche Bemerkungen zu Inschrift und ursprünglicher Platzierung der Bernwardstür." ''Jahrbuch für Geschichte und Kunst im Bistum Hildesheim'' 75/76 (2007/2008) p. 84 n. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--!?--&gt;

== Cast ==
Since 1874 there has been a [[plaster cast]] of the column in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], bought for £18 from one F. Künsthardt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/15500|title=Scenes from the Life of Christ|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=2012|work=The Cast Court Collection|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezantée''', '''bezantie''' or '''bezanty''' is an ornamentation consisting of [[roundel]]s. The word derives from ''[[bezant]]'', a [[gold]] [[coin]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which was in common European use until circa 1250.

In architecture, '''bezantée''' moulding was much used in the Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bezantée |volume=3 |page=840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[heraldry]] the word is shorthand for ''semé of bezants'', i.e. strewn (literally "seeded") with bezants. A bezant is a [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] whose [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] is ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]''. In English heraldry, a field ''sable bezanty'' often alludes to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]].
An ounce (leopard) bezanty appears as a supporter in the English bearings of [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/east_anglia_essex.html St Edmundsbury Borough Council]; a bordure bezanty appears in the coat of [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/thames_valley_chilterns.html Berkhamstead Town Council].

'''Burqush''' or '''Burkush''' ({{lang-ar|برقش}}) is an archaeological site situated {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Beattie|author2=Timothy Pepper|title=The Rough Guide to Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iCfkTe8v2EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-718-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuprechtsbergerErtel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwin Maria Ruprechtsberger|author2=Christine Ertel|title=Vom Mount Hermon zum Djebel Burqush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KkKMAEACAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Stadtmuseum Linz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby [[Wadi al-Qarn – Burqush Important Bird Area|Wadi al-Qarn]] is an important breeding site for wild [[bird]]s in the [[Middle East]] and has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref name="EvansEast1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. I. Evans |title=Important bird areas in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZrwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=BirdLife International|isbn=978-0-946888-28-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site sits at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|1580|m|ft}} and overlooks the [[Damascus]] plain and surrounding hill country where herds of [[goat]]s and [[camel]]s wander the area. Due to the sensitive nature of the territory close to the borders with [[Lebanon]] and the [[Golan]], visitors may need a military escort to access the site, which is a ten-minute walk along a steep track away from the main road.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

Julien Aliquot suggested that the site may have been called '''Barkousa''' in ancient times. This was contrary to the location of '''Barkusha''' that had previously been suggested by [[Albrecht Alt]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, it was renamed '''Justinianopolis''' ({{lang-el|Ἰουστινιανούπολις}}, "city of Justinian") after the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnadk/Lovell_2011.pdf Klein, Konstantin., Review of Aliquot, J., Inscriptions Grecques et Latines de la Syrie - Tome 11: Mount Hermon (Liban et Syrie) Beirut: Presses de l'IFPO (Bibliothèque archéologique et historique 183) Reviews, Levant, Vol 43, No 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potts2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Byzantine basilica and Roman temple==
There are the ruins of two [[Roman temple]]s in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer20082"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=Aliquot, Julien., Sanctuaries and villages on Mount Hermon in the Roman period in The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dar1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimʻon Dar|title=Settlements and cult sites on Mount Hermon, Israel: Ituraean culture in the Hellenistic and Roman periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuwtAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1993|publisher=Tempus Reparatum|isbn=978-0-86054-756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of a 6th-century CE [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]] lie on the top of a hill which has been artificially flattened to form a two level plateau. The area around features numerous rock cut rooms and crypts. The podium on which the basilica is constructed is suggested to be that of a previous [[Roman temple]] suggested to date to the 1st century CE. The Roman temple itself is thought to have been built on the remains of a previous temple that had been in use for secular purposes for at least four hundred years earlier and possibly for many generations prior. The basilica is constructed of massive blocks of stone and the site is littered with other confusing blocks, some of which possibly resemble buildings or unusual [[geological]] outcrops.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

The temple complex at Burqush was mentioned by the [[Germany|German]] archaeological mission to [[Baalbek]] in 1903 and has received little study since then. A [[topographic]] and architectural survey of the site was conducted in 1999 by Gunnar Brands for the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. A dissertation covering the results of the survey is in progress by Frederike von Bargen.&lt;ref name="brands"&gt;[http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/digs/burqush/burqush.htm Burqush (Syria) - Archaeological Survey 1999, Funded by the German Research Foundation, Director: Prof. Dr. Gunnar Brands, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg Institut für Altertumswissenschaften, Seminar für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Bargen, Friederike., Die Kirchenanlage von Burqush im Hermongebirge und ihre Ausstattung, Institut für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunst (in progress)&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey noted complex substructures, and intended to document the surrounding settlements, [[tomb]]s, [[quarries]] and a [[propylon]] temple ruins. The survey was hampered by the remoteness and altitude of the site, tank shelling, and finding a settlement in the area that was twice as large as expected with numerous rock cut tombs nearby. The basement of the basilica was constructed from bedrock and showed a high technical quality of construction. Traces of bronze [[candle]] holders were found along with remnants of a [[marble]] cover that was white with gray veining. Twelve [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] were recorded in 1903, of which only eight remained in place, with three more displaced nearby, one reused for [[medieval]] farming. The twelfth capital had been covered in rubble and totally obscured. The east wall of the basilica features a [[portico]]. Foundations of what were thought to be a [[peristyle]] for the basilica were found to its north west, some of the area to the north was cleared and leveled by the military.&lt;ref name="brands"/&gt;  The remains of the settlement are dispersed on the east slope of the hill are also large buildings on the west slope.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Yukon''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the Canadian territory of [[Yukon]]. The arms was commissioned by the federal [[Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] and designed by well-known heraldry expert [[Alan Beddoe]] in the early 1950s. It was officially approved by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1956.

The lower part of the shield represents Yukon's mountains,&lt;ref name="cansymbols"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/symboles-histoire-symbols-stories/symbole_canada_symbols-eng.pdf|title=Symbols of Canada|year=2008|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=20 November 2008|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the gold disks (called "[[bezants]]," a medieval gold coin) representing the territory's mineral resources and its birth in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. The two white wavy lines represents the territory's rivers.

In chief, the red cross represents England,&lt;ref name="cansymbols"/&gt; the disk surmounting it is in a pattern called "vair," a type of [[heraldic fur]] (literally squirrel fur), and representing the territory's wealth of fur-bearing animals.

The crest is an [[Alaskan Malamute]] dog standing on a mound of snow.

==Blazon==
Shield: ''Azure, on a pallet wavy Argent, a like pallet of the field, issuant from base two piles reversed Gules, fimbriated also Argent, each charged with two bezants in pale, on a chief Argent a cross Gules, surmounted of a roundel vair.''

Crest: ''On a wreath Or and Gules, standing on a mound of snow Proper, an Alaskan Malamute statant Proper.''

'''Copyright''' is a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]], existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.{{Citation needed|reason=1.

Copyright is applicable to certain forms of creative work. Some, but not all jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.{{Citation needed|reason=ref 1 describes US situation only; ref 2 links not to any content relevant to this article; ref 3. is only related to sports, not suitable to use for a general article: ref 4. is a standarised form with an agreement written for US jurisdiction, not suitable as reference |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Copyright|publisher=University of California|year=2014|url=http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetlaw.org/publish/journal-conventions/|title=Journal Conventions - Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment &amp; Technology Law|website=www.jetlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=kz1F6uAHtaEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIHDAA&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Sports Marketing Agreements: Legal, Fiscal and Practical Aspects|first=Ian S.|last=Blackshaw|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xD_iBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT465&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIKDAC&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Publishing Forms and Contracts|first=Roy|last=Kaufman|date=16 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights frequently include reproduction, control over [[derivative work]]s, distribution, [[Performing rights|public performance]], and [[moral rights]] such as attribution.{{Citation needed|reason=ref refers to Section 106 of the Copyright Law of the United States, not suitable as source for general article on copyright |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=17 U.S.C. § 106|publisher=United States of America|year=2011|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="International Copyright Law Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcopyrightlaw.com/copyrightsurvey|title=International Copyright Law Survey|publisher=Mincov Law Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the public law [[Copyright term|duration of a copyright]] expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain [[copyright formalities]] to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] matter, though some jurisdictions do apply [[criminal law|criminal]] sanctions.

Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing "fair" exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to the philosophical basis of copyright law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright, such as those in the music business, have advocated the extension and expansion of copyright and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8472957/bmg-reports-3-percent-revenue-bump-during-first-half-of-2018 |title=BMG Reports Revenue Bump During First Half of 2018 |last=Spahr |first=Wolfgang |date=2018-08-30 |website=Billboard |language=en |access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Copyright licenses can also be granted by those deputized by the original claimant, and private companies may request this as a condition of doing business with them. Services of internet platform providers like YouTube, Facebook, GitHub, Hotmail, DropBox, Instagram, WhatsApp or Twitter only can be used when users grant the platform provider beforehand the right to co-use all uploaded content, including all material exchanged per email, chat or cloud-storage. These copyrights only apply for the firm that operates such a platform, no matter in what jurisdiction the platform-services are being offered. Private companies in general do not recognize exceptions or give users more rights than the right to use the platform according certain rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/10/new-site-grades-those-pesky-terms-of-service-agreements-you-never-read/|title=Those Pesky "Terms of Service" Agreements you never read|publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=24 June 2018 |quote=Facebook — yet to be graded by the new site — has grown notorious over the years for fiddling with its terms of service and privacy policies.

==History==
{{main|History of copyright law}}

===Background===
Copyright came about with the invention of [[Printing press|the printing press]] and with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century. The English [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was concerned about the unregulated [[copying]] of books and passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.

Copyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&amp;nbsp;se.&lt;ref&gt;Bettig, Ronald V. (1996). ''Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property. Westview Press''. p. 9–17. {{ISBN|0-8133-1385-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], films, photographs, software, and architectural works.

===National copyrights===
{{See also|Statute of Anne|History of US Copyright Law}}
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Statute of Anne]] (the Copyright Act 1709) came into force in 1710.]]
Often seen as the first real copyright law, the 1709 British [[Statute of Anne]] gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.&lt;ref name="Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |page=13 |author=Ronan, Deazley |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The act also alluded to individual rights of the artist. It began, "Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing&amp;nbsp;... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors&amp;nbsp;... to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html |title=Statute of Anne |publisher=Copyrighthistory.com |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.

The [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.

The original length of copyright in the United States was 14&amp;nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the [[public domain]], so it could be used and built upon by others.

Copyright law was enacted rather [[Copyright in Germany|late in German states]], and the historian Eckhard Höffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.&lt;ref name="thad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html | author=Frank Thadeusz |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date= 18 August 2010 |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International copyright treaties===
{{See also|International copyright agreements|List of parties to international copyright agreements}}
[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|'' The Pirate Publisher—An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886, satirizes the then-existing situation where a publisher could profit by simply stealing newly published works from one country, and publishing them in another, and vice versa.]]
The 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5 |accessdate=18 November 2011 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100&amp;nbsp;years later with the passage of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkle, Ann M; Fries, Janet; Lopez, Daniel; Possessky, Laura (1997). "Art conservation and the legal obligation to preserve artistic intent". [[JAIC]] 36 (2): 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and most [[Latin America]]n countries instead entered into the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] in 1910, which required a copyright notice on the work (such as ''[[all rights reserved]]''), and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf "International Copyright Relations of the United States"], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Copyright Office Circular No.&amp;nbsp;38a, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Parties to the Geneva Act of the Universal Copyright Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }} as of 1 January 2000: the dates given in the document are dates of ratification, not dates of coming into force. The Geneva Act came into force on 16 September 1955, for the first twelve to have ratified (which included four non-members of the Berne Union as required by Art.&amp;nbsp;9.1), or three months after ratification for other countries. {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.ht/en 165&amp;nbsp;Parties to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306215357/http://copyright.ht/en |date=6 March 2016 }} as of May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the [[Soviet Union]] and developing nations.

The regulations of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] are incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC |page=39 |author1=MacQueen, Hector L |author2=Charlotte Waelde |author3=Graeme T Laurie |isbn=978-0-19-926339-4 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]] signed the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations]]. In 1996, this organization was succeeded by the founding of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], which launched the 1996 [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]] and the 2002 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]], which enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it. The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] includes [[Trans-Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Provisions|intellectual Property Provisions]] relating to copyright.

Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through these international conventions such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and [[Universal Copyright Convention]]. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and [[international organizations]] such as the [[European Union]] or [[World Trade Organization]] require their member states to comply with them.

==Obtaining protection==
===Ownership===
The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself if the work is a "[[work for hire]]".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 201(b); Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[English law]] the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a "Work for Hire". Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the [[author]].&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-ownership/|title=Copyright Ownership: Who Owns What? - Copyright Overview by Rich Stim - Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center|website=fairuse.stanford.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"/&gt; But when more than one person creates the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met.

===Eligible works===
Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Specifics vary by [[jurisdiction]], but these can include [[poem]]s, [[theses]], [[Copyright Protection for Fictional Characters|fictional characters]] [[drama|plays]] and other [[book|literary works]], [[film|motion pictures]], [[choreography]], [[music|musical compositions]], [[sound recording]]s, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[computer software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]], and [[industrial design]]s. Graphic [[designs]] and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;as_brr=3|page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4081 |format=PDF|last=World Intellectual Property Organization|title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=1 December 2017|page=8|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and copyright|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;as_brr=3|pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the copyright to a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating [[derivative work]]s based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] particular [[anthropomorphic]] mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"/&gt; Note additionally that Mickey Mouse is not copyrighted because characters cannot be copyrighted; rather, [[Steamboat Willie]] is copyrighted and Mickey Mouse, as a character in that copyrighted work, is afforded protection.

===Originality===
{{main|Threshold of originality}}
Typically, a work must meet [[Threshold of originality|minimal standards of originality]] in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some "skill, labour, and judgment" that has gone into it.&lt;ref&gt;''Express Newspaper Plc v News (UK) Plc'', F.S.R. 36 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.

Copyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.

===Registration===
{{main|Copyright registration}}
[[File:Fermat Last Theorem "proof" registered by Ukraine officials.jpg|thumb|right|A copyright certificate for proof of the [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of Ukraine.]]
In all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"/&gt; However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright|url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf|website=copyright.gov|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)

A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]]. It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the [[postmark]] to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "This technique has not been recognized by any United States court" is overbroad because not all such cases are reported, and it is impossible to know whether this is correct.--&gt; The United States Copyright Office says the technique is not a substitute for actual registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright in General (FAQ)|url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman|publisher=U.S Copyright Office|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique and notes that the technique (as well as commercial registries) does not constitute dispositive proof that the work is original or establish who created the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm "Copyright Registers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014901/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm |date=5 October 2013 }}, United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-about/c-auto.htm "Automatic right"], United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use." overstates the UK IPO position; the IPO does NOT recommend against the PMC approach.--&gt;

===Fixing===
The [[Berne Convention]] allows member countries to decide whether creative works must be "fixed" to enjoy copyright. Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: "It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form." Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be "fixed in a tangible medium of expression" to obtain copyright protection.&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"&gt;See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law'']. See also Tyler T. Ochoa, [http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol20/iss4/5 ''Copyright, Derivative Works and Fixation: Is Galoob a Mirage, or Does the Form(GEN) of the Alleged Derivative Work Matter?''], 20 {{smallcaps|Santa Clara High Tech.}} L.J. 991, 999–1002 (2003) ("Thus, both the text of the Act and its legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended that a derivative work does not need to be fixed in order to infringe."). The legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act says this difference was intended to address transitory works such as ballets, pantomimes, improvised performances, dumb shows, mime performances, and dancing.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be "perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be "expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance."&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

===Copyright notice===
{{main|Copyright notice}}
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|upright|A copyright symbol used in copyright notice]]
Before 1989, United States law required the use of a copyright notice, consisting of the [[copyright symbol]] (©, the letter '''C''' inside a circle), the abbreviation "Copr.", or the word "Copyright", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act of 1976, {{USPL|94|553}}, 90 Stat. 2541, § 401(a) (19 October 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), {{USPL|100|568}}, 102 Stat. 2853, 2857. One of the changes introduced by the BCIA was to section&amp;nbsp;401, which governs copyright notices on published copies, specifying that notices "may be placed on" such copies; prior to the BCIA, the statute read that notices "shall be placed on all" such copies. An analogous change was made in section&amp;nbsp;402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (℗, the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' indicating a "phonorecord". In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age.|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador|year=2014|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|location=New York City, New York, USA|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&amp;nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |title=U.S. Copyright Office – Information Circular |format=PDF |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit&amp;nbsp;– using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of "innocent infringement" being successful.&lt;ref&gt;[[17 U.S.C.]]{{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])

In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.

"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Astra|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|date=2014|publisher=Picador|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement===
{{main|Copyright infringement}}
For a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Improper use of materials outside of legislation is deemed "unauthorized edition", not copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1087/09531510125100313 | title = Piracy | journal = Learned Publishing | volume = 14 | pages = 67–70 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics regarding the effects of copyright infringement are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to determine whether there is a monetary loss for industries affected by copyright infringement by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, S. Piracy Losses "Billboard" 199(36)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports indicate that copyright infringement does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry, and can have a positive effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/mi/2011/2011-11-30.html |title=Urheberrechtsverletzungen im Internet: Der bestehende rechtliche Rahmen genügt |publisher=Ejpd.admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a 2014 university study concluded that free music content, accessed on YouTube, does not necessarily hurt sales, instead has the potential to increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing|ssrn=2425386|title=Video Killed the Radio Star? Online Music Videos and Digital Music Sales|ISSN=2042-2695|year=2014|authors=Tobias Kretschmer &amp; Christian Peukert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights granted==
===Exclusive rights===
Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright:
* protection of the work
* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.
* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)
* to import or export the work
* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)
* to perform or display the work publicly
* to sell or cede these rights to others
* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase "exclusive right" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a "negative right", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf "Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?"] Accessed 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] --&gt;
{{main|Copyright term|List of countries' copyright length}}
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (currently based on the date of creation or publication).]]
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA|last=Nimmer|first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2003|isbn=  978-90-411-8876-2|oclc=50606064|page=63|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].", ''[[Cornell University]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter B. Hirtle, "Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.

But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.

In 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and exceptions==
{{main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}

In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. US copyright does NOT cover names, title, short phrases or Listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover – such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.

There are some exceptions to what copyright will protect. Copyright will not protect:
* Names of products
* Names of businesses, organizations, or groups
* Pseudonyms of individuals
* Titles of works
* Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes, slogans, or short advertising expressions
* Listings of ingredients in recipes, labels, and formulas, though the directions can be copyrighted

===Idea–expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine===
{{main|Idea–expression divide}}

The idea–expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).

===The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights===

{{main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}
Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.

Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.

In ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.

In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.

===Fair use and fair dealing===
{{main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[Fair use|fair use doctrine]], codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:
# the purpose and character of one's use
# the nature of the copyrighted work
# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to “format shift” that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to “time shift” a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.

In the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.

:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''

:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''

Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"/&gt; An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.

The [[copyright directive]] allows EU member states to implement a set of exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:
*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,
*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial
*archival reproductions of broadcasts,
*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,
*for demonstration or repair of equipment,
*for non-commercial research or private study
*when used in [[parody]]

===Accessible copies===
It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 - U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp|title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force|publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Transfer and licensing, and assignment}} Transfer, assignment and licensing==
{{see also|Collective rights management|Extended collective licensing|Compulsory license|Copyright transfer agreement}}
[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]
A copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.

A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.

Copyright may also be [[license]]d.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"/&gt; Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.

===Free licenses===
Copyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].

Founded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website|website=creativecommons.org|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt;

Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Opposition to copyright}}
Some sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].

The interests of big internet platform service providers like Google, Amazon, Facebook or Microsoft, partly depending on users uploading content for free to their servers, collide with those of original content creators and right holders, both big, like Sony, Getty Images, Warner Bros, Elsevier, Springer and small, like local bands, national newspapers and TV-channels. In Germany the national public organisation GEMA, that collects copyright fees for composers, copywriters and music-publishers, won a juridical fight with Google over payment for songs published on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/kultur/gema-gewinnt-gegen-youtube-2782939.html|title=Gema gewinnt gegen YouTube |publisher=Saechsische Zeitung |accessdate= 24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns are often couched in the language of [[Digital rights|digital rights, digital freedom]], [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship|publisher=European Digital Rights |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, a political party has been grown out of it, ''The Pirates''. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].

==Public domain==
{{main|Public domain}}
Copyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.

'''''Cry Freedom''''' is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by [[Richard Attenborough]], set in late-1970s  [[apartheid]] era [[South Africa]]. The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

The film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by [[MCA Home Video]] for home media. ''Cry Freedom'' premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nyTimesCryFreedom"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]], liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.

After speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.

Later, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&amp;nbsp;020&amp;nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.

Woods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to [[London]], where they were granted [[political asylum]].

The film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]
The premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]]; and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the [[Black People's Convention]] working on social upliftment projects around Durban.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrican&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/stevebiko/a/bio-Biko.htm |title=Stephen Bantu (Steve) Biko |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko's death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those closely associated with Biko.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life,&lt;ref name=BBCuk /&gt; Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government.&lt;ref name=BBCuk&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/1/newsid_2459000/2459845.stm 1978: Newspaper editor flees South Africa]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved 20 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: ''[[Biko (book)|Biko]]'', exposing police complicity in his death.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; That book, along with Woods's autobiography ''Asking For Trouble'', both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.&lt;ref name=SouthAfricanHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/bios/biko-s.htm |title=Stephen Bantu Biko |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal filming took place primarily in the Republic of [[Zimbabwe]] because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting. Other filming locations included [[Kenya]], as well as film studios in [[Shepperton, England|Shepperton]] and [[Middlesex, England]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Attenborough|Attenborough, Richard]] (Director).

Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of African schoolchildren during a protest march.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt;

===Music===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''Cry Freedom'' was released by [[MCA Records]] on 25 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5E |title=Cry Freedom: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |accessdate=2010-06-15 |publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features songs composed by veteran musicians [[George Fenton]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]] and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko's funeral they sing the hymn [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]. Jonathan Bates edited the film's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800052312/cast |title=Cry Freedom |accessdate=2010-06-15 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said actor Washington gave a "zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25."&lt;ref&gt;Kempley, Rita (6 November 1987).

He saw director Attenborough's aims as "more academic and political than dramatic". Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, "In a country busier than Chile with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods' slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;Howe, Desson (6 November 1987).

But on a negative front, he noted how the film "promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that [[Night Crossing|Disney movie]] where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (6 November 1987).

[[Janet Maslin]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the film as "bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others" but pointed out that "it isn't dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form." She also complimented the African scenery, noting that "''Cry Freedom'' can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor's picturesque cinematography".&lt;ref name="maslin"/&gt; The ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Staff]]'', felt Washington did "a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulate and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup." On Kline's performance, they noticed how his "low-key screen presence served him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist."&lt;ref&gt;Variety Staff (1 January 1987).

Mark Salisbury of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|TimeOut]]'' boasted on the film's merits by declaring the lead acting to be "excellent" and the crowd scenes "astonishing", while equally observing how the climax was "truly nerve-wracking".

'''David Hammons''' (born 1943) is an American artist especially known for his works in and around [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==

David Hammons was born in 1943 in [[Springfield, Illinois]], the youngest of ten children of a single mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schjeldahl|first=Peter|title=The Walker|journal=The New Yorker|date=December 23, 2002|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/12/23/021223craw_artworld|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962 he moved to Los Angeles, where he started attending Chouinard Art Institute (now [[CalArts]]) from 1966 to 1968 and the [[Otis Art Institute]] from 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hammons - Biography|url=http://www.lmgallery.com/artists/david-hammons/?view=bio|publisher=L&amp;M Arts|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he was influenced by internationally known artists such as [[Bruce Nauman]], [[John Baldessari]], and [[Chris Burden]], but was also part of a pioneering group of [[African-American]] artists and jazz musicians in Los Angeles, with influence outside the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960–1980|url=http://www.momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/352|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 Hammons settled in New York City, where he slowly became better known nationally. He still lives and works in New York.

==Art practice==
Much of his work reflects his commitment to the civil rights and [[Black Power]] movements. A good example is the early ''Spade with Chains'' (1973), where the artist employs a provocative, derogatory term, coupled with the literal [[spade|gardening instrument]], in order to make a visual pun between the blade of a shovel and an African mask, and a contemporary statement about the issues of bondage and resistance. This was part of a larger series of "Spade" works in the 1970s, including ''Bird'' (1973), where [[Charlie Parker]] is evoked by a spade emerging from a saxophone, and ''Spade'', a 1974 print where the artist pressed his face against the shape leaving a caricature-like imprint of Negroid features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Hammons took part in [[Colab]]'s ground-breaking ''The Times Square Show'', which acted as a forum for exchange of ideas for a younger set of alternative artists in New York. His installation was made of glistening scattered shards of glass (from broken bottles of Night Train wine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahern|first=Charles|title=The Times Square Show revisited|url=http://timessquareshowrevisited.com/accounts/charlie-ahearn.html|work=(as told to Shawna Cooper, August 8, 2011)|publisher=Hunter College Gallery, CUNY|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works play on the association of basketball and young black men, such as drawings made by repeatedly bouncing a dirty basketball on huge sheets of clean white paper set on the floor; a series of larger-than-life basketball hoops, meticulously decorated with bottle caps, evoking Islamic mosaic and design; and ''Higher Goals'' (1986), where an ordinary basketball hoop, net, and backboard are set on a three-story high pole - commenting on the almost impossible aspirations of sports stardom as a way out of the ghetto.

Through his varied work and media, and frequent changes in direction, Hammons has managed to avoid one signature visual style. Much of his work makes allusions to, and shares concerns with minimalism and post-minimal art, but with added Duchampian references to the place of Black people in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[James Turrell]]'s works concerning perception of light, Hammons said "I wish I could make art like that, but we're too oppressed for me to be dabbling out there.... I would love to do that because that could also be very black. You know, as a black artist, dealing just with light. They would say, "how in the hell could he deal with that, coming from where he did?" I want to get to that, I'm trying to get to that, but I'm not free enough yet. I still feel I have to get my message out."&lt;ref&gt;Mcfadden, Jane. "Here, here, or there : on the whereabouts of art in the seventies." ''Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980''. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his focus on cultural overtones, Hammons’s work also discusses the notions of public and private spaces, as well as what constitutes a valuable commodity. An illustration of these concepts can be seen in ''Bliz-aard Ball Sale'' (1983), a performance piece in which Hammons situates himself alongside street vendors in downtown [[Manhattan]] in order to sell snowballs which are priced according to size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Can you remove the rainbow from happening?|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=13122|work=InEnArt|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act serves both as a parody on commodity exchange and a commentary on the capitalistic nature of art fostered by art galleries. Furthermore, it puts a satirical premium on "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", ridiculing the superficial luxury of racial classification as well as critiquing the hard social realities of street vending experienced by those who have been discriminated against in terms of race or class.

Also noteworthy is the artist's use of discarded or [[Abject Art|abject]] materials, including but not limited to elephant dung, chicken parts, strands of African-American hair, and bottles of cheap wine. Many critics see these objects as evocative of the desperation of the poor, Black urban class, but Hammons reportedly saw a sort of sacrosanct or ritualistic power in these materials, which is why he utilized them so extensively.

==Others==

In "The Window: Rented Earth: David Hammons,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Window: Rented Earth: David Hammons |url=http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/27 |publisher=New Museum archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early solo exhibition at the [[New Museum]], Hammons dealt with the diametrically opposed relationship between spirituality and technology by juxtaposing an African tribal mask with a modern-day invention—a child’s toy television set.

Hammons explored the [[video]] medium, collaborating with artist [[Alex Harsley]] on a number of video works, including ''Phat Free'' (originally titled ''Kick the Bucket''), which was included in the [[Whitney Biennial]] and other venues. Hammons and Harsley have also collaborated on [[Installation art|installations]] at New York's 4th Street Photo Gallery, a noted East Village artist exhibition and project space.

In a show at L &amp; M Arts in uptown Manhattan (January 18–March 31, 2007, his first authorized New York show since 2002, although there have been unauthorized surveys), Hammons collaborated with Japanese artist Chie (Hasegawa) Hammons in a piece that enjoyed public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Rail'' (April 2007), "David and Chie Hammons," review by Jen Schwarting; ''The Village Voice'' (February 27, 2007), "Fur What It's Worth," by Jerry Saltz; among others.&lt;/ref&gt; In the posh uptown gallery specially selected by Hammons (who does not accept to be associated with any one gallery), they installed full-length fur coats on antique dress forms—two minks, a fox, a sable, a wolf and a chinchilla: "Hammons and his wife have also painted, burned, burnished, and stained the backs of all of these coats, turning them into aesthetic/ethical/sartorial traps.... Hammons has said that he wants 'to slide away from visuals and get deeper.' At L &amp; M, not only does Hammons do this; along the way he conjures thoughts of shamanism, politics, consumerism, animism, genre painting, animal rights, and jokes. Here, we're treated to a sensibility as barbed, serious, maybe fearsome, and as passionate as any in the art world."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, "Fur What It's Worth", ''[[The Village Voice]]'', February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and awards==
Hammons’s ''African American Flag'' is a part of the permanent collection of New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]]. He also has work in the permanent collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York; [[Fogg Art Museum]], Cambridge; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington DC]]; [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]], Chicago; [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]; [[Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain]], [[Paris]]; [[The Tate]], [[London]]; and other museums and collections.

Hammons received the [[MacArthur Fellowship]] (popularly known as the "Genius Grant") in July 1991.

The '''Early English Text Society''' ('''EETS''') is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1864, dedicated to the editing and publication of early English texts, especially those only available in manuscript. Most of its volumes contain editions of [[Middle English]] or [[Old English]] texts. It is known for having been the first to print many important English manuscripts, including [[Cotton Library|Cotton Nero A.x]], which contains ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and other poems.

==History==
[[File:Blickling homilies leaf 141.png|thumb|left|A page of the [[Blickling Homilies]] in facsimile, as reproduced in ''The Blickling Homilies of the Tenth Century: from the Marquis of Lothian's unique MS A.D. 971'', edited and translated by [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]], EETS o.s. vols 58, 63, 73 (1874–80)]]
The Society was founded in England in 1864 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]]. Its stated goal in a report of its first year of existence was, "on the one hand, to print all that is most valuable of the yet unprinted {{abbr|MSS.|manuscripts}} in English, and, on the other, to re-edit and reprint all that is most valuable in printed English books, which from their scarcity or price are not within the reach of the student of moderate means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 Nov 2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17000/17000-h/17000-h.htm#report |title=Report of the Committee, January, 1865 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2016, the Society had published 347 volumes in its Original Series; 126 volumes in its Extra Series, published between 1867 and 1935, comprising texts previously printed, but only in unsatisfactory or rare editions; and 25 volumes in its Supplementary Series, an occasional and irregular series initiated in 1970. The Society keeps the majority of its older publications in print, excepting only those which have been superseded by subsequent editions in its own series. Volumes are now published on behalf of the Society by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~eets/list-of-all-publications-2015.pdf |title=List of Publications 2015 |publisher=Early English Text Society |accessdate=30 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]]]]
The Society emblem is a modified representation of the Anglo-Saxon [[Alfred Jewel]], incorporating a scroll bearing the name of the Society.

==Notable members==
Notable members of the society when it was formed in 1864 included [[Frederick James Furnivall|Furnivall]] himself, [[Alfred Tennyson]] ([[poet laureate]]), [[Warren de la Rue]] (inventor of the [[lightbulb]]), [[Richard Chenevix Trench]] (Irish ecclesiastic), Stephen Austin (a [[Hertford]]-based printer), Edith Coleridge (granddaughter of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), the Rev. [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]] (the editor of 12 volumes between 1862 and 1880), and others.

'''''Fake or Fortune?''''' is a [[BBC One]] television series which examines the [[provenance]] and attribution of notable [[art]]works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-west-england-awards-2016|title=RTS West of England Awards 2016 {{!}} Royal Television Society|website=rts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first series aired in 2011, ''Fake or Fortune?'' has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz |title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=4 December 2016 |work=The Times |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest for an arts show in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/fake-or-fortune|title=Fake or Fortune|website=www.bbcstudios.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| ShortSummary       = [[Queensland]] residents Joe and Rosanna Natoli bought a painting with the signature "[[Tom Roberts]]" at auction for £7,500. Expert opinion after the purchase, however, was that it was not by the important Australian impressionist of that name. [[Infrared]] examination revealed that the back had the title "Rejected", the name Tom Roberts and an address in London's [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] that was shown to be Roberts' address while studying at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. Roberts' sketchbooks showed initial studies which appeared to be preliminaries for the work under investigation. One of the leading authorities on Roberts' work, Mary Eagle of the [[State Library of New South Wales]], accepts it as genuine and Mould values it in excess of £200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/04/fake-tom-roberts-painting-lost-for-136-years-revealed-to-be-worth-325000|title=Lost for 136 years: ‘fake’ Tom Roberts painting bought for £7,500 could sell for $1m|first=Susan|last=Chenery|date=3 September 2017|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Title            = Paul Gauguin
| DirectedBy    = Rachel Jardine
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|13|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = A [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicolson]] painting, of a glass jug, plates and two pears, was purchased by a collector from the estate of her aunt, [[Lillian Browse]], a respected gallery owner and author of Nicholson's catalogue raisonné. The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson. Reed does not change her opinion, however, stating that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was definitely by Nicholson.&lt;ref name=Express2018-08-12/&gt; and not someone working alongside him.&lt;ref name="BBC-b0bg6f43"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicholson |series=''Fake or Fortune?'' |serieslink=Fake or Fortune? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bg6f43/fake-or-fortune-series-7-1-nicholson |accessdate=18 August 2018 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 12 August 2018  |seriesno=7 |number=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Title            = Lautrec
| DirectedBy    = Rachel Jardine
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|19|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

| DirectedBy    = Lucy Swigler
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|08|26|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate whether a small watercolour sketch could be by the British 20th-century sculptor [[Henry Moore]], thought to be the only piece by a British artist in a private collection of around 1,500 works discovered in Germany in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drawing-in-the-gurlitt-hoard-an-unknown-henry-moore-1193831&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Gurlitt Hoard]], it is suspected to contain many objects of art looted by the Nazis, and the team is now asked by the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, to find out if the sketch is among these. Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| Title             = A Double Whodunnit
| DirectedBy        = Francis Welch
| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2018|09|02|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

| ShortSummary       = Answering the programme's call for works of art other than paintings, Philip and Fiona investigate what appears to be a [[plaster cast|plaster]] sculpture of [[Alberto Giacometti]]'s early work ''Tete qui regarde'' or ''[[Gazing Head]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-set-to-appear-in-the-new-series-of-the-fake-or-fortune-television-show-1-4970438|title=Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts set to appear in the new series of the Fake or Fortune? television show|first=Emma|last=Knights|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti"&gt;https://twitter.com/philipmould/status/1038857131821281281&lt;/ref&gt; The object shows signs of extensive damage, and a [[CT scan]] reveals it has been stapled, stitched and glued back together several times. Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

==Reception==
{{update|section|reason=reviews and coverage of later series|date=August 2017}}
Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery. But I couldn't entirely shift the suspicion that some of it was just a little too good to be true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|title=The Weekend's TV: ''Fake or Fortune?''

Reviewing an episode of the seventh season, Michael Hogan of The Telegraph wrote "Arts programming is an increasingly endangered beast on prime time television.

'''International Children's Book Day''' ('''ICBD''') is a yearly event sponsored by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] (IBBY), an international non-profit organization. Founded in 1967, the day is observed on or around [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s birthday, April 2. Activities include writing competitions, announcements of book awards and events with authors of [[children's literature]].

Each year a different National Section of IBBY has the opportunity to be the international sponsor of ICBD. It decides upon a theme and invites a prominent author from the host country to write a message to the children of the world and a well-known illustrator to design a poster. These materials are used in different ways to promote books and reading. Many IBBY Sections promote ICBD through the media and organize activities in schools and public libraries. Often ICBD is linked to celebrations around children's books and other special events that may include encounters with authors and illustrators, writing competitions or announcements of book awards.

'''Ivor Davies''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} is a Welsh-speaking, Welsh artist born in [[Treharris]], in November 1935. He currently lives and works in [[Penarth]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ivor-davies/index.shtml |title=Wales – Arts – Ivor Davies – Ivor Davies |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy Davies went to [[Penarth]] County School. He studied at [[Cardiff College of Art]] and [[Swansea College of Art]] between 1952 and 1957 and then from 1959 to 1961 he studied at the [[University of Lausanne]] in Switzerland.

==Artwork==
Davies is passionate about the [[Welsh culture|culture]], [[Welsh language|language]] and [[Politics of Wales|politics]] of Wales, which inspire his artwork. For a number of years he has sponsored the ''Ivor Davies Award'' at ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (''Art Space'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], for an artwork "that conveys the spirit of activism in the struggle for language, culture and politics in Wales".&lt;ref name="eisteddfod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/uploads/publications/336.pdf|date=15 October 2009|title=Visual Arts Exhibition, Y Lle Celf at Blaenau Gwent|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies' early works in the 1960s used explosives as an expression of society's destructive nature. Davies took part in the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in London in 1966.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s4c"/&gt; More recent work has included painting, installations; he has also designed and installed a [[mosaic]] of [[Saint David]] at [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Germaine Greer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/19/germaine-greer-catholic-art-papal-visit |title=Catholic art was once the domain of Titian.

The '''Jewish Theater of New York''' is a theatre company founded in 1994, with the production of ''[[One Hundred Gates]]'' by playwright/director [[Tuvia Tenenbom]]. 

{{As of|2003}}, The Jewish Theater of New York is the only [[English language|English-speaking]] [[Jew]]ish theatre company in [[New York (state)|New York state]].

The Theater normally presents between one and two new shows a year in [[New York City]]. {{As of|2001}}, its productions are also mounted yearly in [[Europe]] [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/International%20Partners.htm (link)]. Starting 2013, the Jewish Theater combines action and word in a program it calls, Redefining Theater Through Literature, uniting [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/Presentations-Abroad-2013.htm stage and literature], acting and books, into one unit.

The Theater, [[avant-garde]] and [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] at times, has been highly acclaimed by local and international critics. Some of its shows, such as ''Father of the Angels,'' ''Love Letters to Adolf Hitler,'' ''Diary of Adolf Eichmann,'' ''The Suicide Bomber,'' ''Love in Great Neck,'' ''The Last Virgin,'' ''Last Jew in Europe'' and others, have been written about in much of the Western press [http://jewishtheater.org/Jewish%20Theater/reviews.htm (link)] and are also studied in universities.  

The Jewish Theater of New York was founded by [[Tuvia Tenenbom]], a former [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]].

'''''Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII''''' (French: ''Jeanne d’Arc au sacre du roi Charles VII'') is an 1854 painting by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. It is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]].

The work merges the style of Ingres' teacher [[Jacques-Louis David]] with that of the [[troubador style]].&lt;ref name= PC&gt;Patricia Fride R. Carrassat and Isabelle Marcadé, ''Movimientos de la pintura'', Spes Editorial, S.L., 2004, p. 47, {{ISBN|84-8332-596-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began with a nude model, adding the clothes and armour.&lt;ref name= CA&gt;P. F. R. Carrassat, ''Maestros de la pintura'', Spes Editorial, S.L., 2005. {{ISBN|84-8332-597-7}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first commissioned by the director of the Academie des Belles Artes in [[Orléans]] to commemorate [[Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref name= BE&gt;Bárbara Eschenburg and Ingeborg Güssow, "El Romanticismo y el Realismo" in ''Los maestros de la pintura occidental'', Taschen, 2005, p. 428, {{ISBN|3-8228-4744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows her at the coronation of [[Charles VII of France]] in [[Reims Cathedral]], victorious and looking up to heaven, which she felt had given France the victory. To her right are three pages, the monk Jean Paquerel, and a servant. The servant is a self-portrait of the artist.&lt;ref name= BE /&gt; The scene is marked by ambient light, sumptuous objects and rich colours.&lt;ref name= BE /&gt;

'''Lachesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|k|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-el|Λάχεσις}}, ''Lakhesis'', "disposer of lots", from {{lang|grc|λαγχάνω}}, ''lanchano'', "to obtain by lot, by fate, or by the will of the gods"), in [[ancient Greek religion]], was the second of the Three Fates, or [[Moirai]]: [[Clotho]], Lachesis and [[Atropos]].  Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life.&lt;ref name="Weigle2007"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Marta Weigle|last=Weigle|first=Marta|title=Spiders and Spinsters: Women and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aLCcrYU0LwC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 July 2007|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-0-86534-587-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Roman equivalent was [[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edith (1942). ''Mythology'', p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. {{ISBN|978-0-316-34114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.

==Origin==
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters ([[Atropos]] and [[Clotho]]) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 901–6; cf. {{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=William|last2=Hansen|first2=William Freeman|title=Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks And Romans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_s8nSgrD0jkC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=29 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530035-2|page=153}}, {{cite web|url=http://cantos33.weebly.com/atropos.html |title=Dante's Inferno: Cantos XXXIII - Atropos |publisher=Cantos33.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the ''Republic'' of Plato as the daughter of [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity]]. She instructs the souls who are about to choose their next life, assign them lots, and presents them all of the kinds, human and animal, from which they may choose their next life.

'''Fiction in the '70s''' brought a return of old-fashioned storytelling, especially with [[Erich Segal|Erich Segal's]] ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. The early seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Peter De Vries]], both of whom released poorly received novels at the start of the decade, but rebounded critically as the decade wore on. Racism remained a key literary subject.  [[John Updike]] emerged as a major literary figure with his 1971 novel ''Rabbit Redux''. Reflections of the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and Wright Morris. With the rising cost of hardcover books and the increasing readership of "[[genre fiction]]", the [[paperback]] became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', were common literary elements.  The horror genre also emerged, and by the late seventies [[Stephen King]] had become one of the most popular novelists in America, a coveted position he maintained in the following decade.

In nonfiction, several books related to Nixon and the [[Watergate scandal]] topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Books discussing sex such as ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' were popular as authors took advantage of the lifted censorship laws on literature in the sixties. Exposés such as ''[[All the President's Men]]'' were also popular. Self-help and diet books replaced the cookbooks and home fix-it manuals that topped the sixties's charts.

==Fiction==
After the experimentation and sexual offence subject matter that exemplified some of the sixties' most definitive works of literature, the early '70s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling. [[Erich Segal|Erich Segal's]] ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' was a tender romance that captured America, topping best-seller lists for the better part of the year and producing a successful film adaptation by the end of 1970.

The seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Peter De Vries]], who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Meanwhile, ''[[Islands in the Stream (novel)|Islands in the Stream]]'', a posthumously released [[Ernest Hemingway]] novel, was released. While Hemingway's classic style showed through, it was criticized as overwrought.

Racism remained a key subject in literature throughout the early seventies. While [[Madison Jones]]' ''A Cry of Absence'' and [[Ernest J. Gaines]]' ''[[The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman]]'' studied racism in the past, works like that of [[Nadine Gordimer]] and [[Bernard Malamud]] studied race relations in South Africa and New York respectively.

In the early seventies, [[John Updike]] emerged as a major literary figure with the release of ''Bech: A Book'', a semi-autobiographical look at a Jewish novelist, the continuing Rabbit series (including 1971's popular ''Rabbit Redux''), and his numerous subtle, relevant stories. Reflections of the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and [[Wright Morris]]. Books like ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' by [[Judith Rossner]] explored sex, single-parenthood, and the singles life in fresh, intriguing, and even unsettling light.

With the rising cost of hardcover books and the increasing readership of "[[genre fiction]]", the [[paperback]] became a popular medium through the popular fiction of [[Peter Benchley]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]]. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic with works such as ''[[The Onion Field]]'', written by [[Los Angeles]] policeman [[Joseph Wambaugh]], and the narrative ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]'', about the infamous [[Charles Manson]] killings, written by [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Curt Gentry]].

1975 brought the popular ''[[Watership Down]]'' by [[Richard Adams]], a juvenile novel about a family of rabbits which found a home in mainstream literary circles. [[Joseph Heller]]'s dramatic novel of middle age, ''Something Happened'', was the author's first book since ''[[Catch-22]]'' in 1961. [[James A. Michener]] also returned to prominence in the seventies, first with ''[[Chesapeake (novel)|Chesapeake]]'', a story of four families interwoven throughout their interactions in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area of [[Maryland]], and later with ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'', a historical novel about a family living in Colorado in the time of the 1870s. In 1976, ''Centennial'' was adapted to a popular television [[miniseries]]. [[John Jakes]] would release a Bicentennial series of novels himself, which helped launch his writing career and were nearly as popular as Michener's book.

[[E. L. Doctorow]]'s ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' became one of the most popular books of 1976 with its unconventional style and satiric nature. Saul Bellow returned with the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''Humboldt's Gift'', about a failed poet and a rising playwright. The same year [[Alex Haley]] released his immensely popular ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'', which followed Haley's ancestry back to the kidnapping of a young black man named [[Kunta Kinte]], who was sold into slavery in the south. Also that same year, [[Alice Walker]] published ''[[Meridian (novel)|Meridian]]'', about the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and [[Renata Adler]] released the feminist classic, ''[[Speedboat (novel)|Speedboat]]''.

By the late seventies, a former English teacher from [[Maine]] had become one of the most popular [[genre novelist]]s with his tales of horror and suspense. [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] 1974 novel, ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', became a best seller and spawned a popular 1976 film. He followed ''Carrie'' with ''[['Salem's Lot]]'', a vampire tale; ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', a spooky romp set in a deserted hotel; ''[[The Stand]]'', a post-apocalyptic shocker; and ''[[The Dead Zone (novel)|The Dead Zone]]'', about a comatose man who awakens with psychic abilities. King also released a collection of short stories and two novels under the pseudonym [[Richard Bachman]].

The world of fiction saw a return of the [[muckraker]]. Books by John Blair{{clarify|date=May 2013}} and [[Robert Engler]] warned of the problems caused by America's dependence on oil while [[Sidney Lens|Sidney Lens']] ''The Day Before Doomsday'' warned of nuclear annihilation. [[Mario Puzo]]'s much-awaited follow-up to ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Fools Die]]'', was released in 1978 and instantly became a best seller.

Notable works such as [[William Styron]]'s [[Holocaust]] epic, ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'', rounded out the decade. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''Jailbird'' reflected the comic results of the Watergate scandal while [[Nadine Gordimer]] continued to write in favor of an end to [[Apartheid]]. By decade's end, [[Tom Wolfe]] topped the best-seller lists with ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'', which celebrated the early NASA test pilots and astronauts.

After two decades of cookbooks, historical novels and inspirational religious fiction topping the bestseller charts, literature in the seventies took a new turn. The independence and freedom themes of the sixties showed up in early seventies literature, with a 1970 fiction top ten bestseller, ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' by [[John Fowles]]. Fowles tells a story about a woman choosing to raise a child on her own in an artists world, as opposed to marrying into money and high society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|author=John Fowles|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the picture books and inspirational religious fiction of the sixties disappeared, irreverence and satire became the norm. In ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', Kurt Vonnegut in 1973 maintained with humorous analogy an extensive satirical discussion of American society, revealing his views on such topics as marketing, government and the environment. Richard Adams in ''[[Watership Down]]'' commented on the environment and the land development industry, speaking through a society of rabbits. In 1972, [[Richard Bach]] made an avatar out of a bird in ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'', and by 1977 made a savior out of a car mechanic in ''[[Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah]]''. Vonnegut ended the decade with ''[[Jailbird (novel)|Jailbird]]'', a satire on the innocent unknown faces, the guilty known ones, and the born again Christians that spent time in prison because of Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal.

The resurgent popularity of the horror novel, which had begun in the late 1960s with [[Ira Levin]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' continued with ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'' by [[William P. Blatty]] in 1971 and with the sensational ''[[The Amityville Horror|Amityville Horror]]'' by [[Jay Anson]] in 1977. In 1979, [[Stephen King]] first made the fiction top ten with ''[[The Dead Zone (novel)|The Dead Zone]]'', a fitting end to seventies literature, and along with Vonnegut, Bach, the diet books and the self-help manuals on the lists in 1979, gave a good indication of what American society would be reading in the future, and how much the seventies impacted and helped to change American culture.

==Nonfiction==
[[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward|Robert Woodward]], writers from the ''[[Washington Post]]'', published ''[[The Final Days]]'' in 1976. The best-selling book documented the downfall of President [[Richard Nixon]], and their involvement in his resignation, he was not impeached. Throughout this period many other books related to Nixon and the [[Watergate scandal]] topped the best-selling lists. 

1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. 

By 1975, the independence and freedom themes evolved into the swinging singles scene, with ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' by [[Judith Rossner]] at number four on the fiction top ten list. Sex hit the top of the non-fiction charts in 1970, with authors taking advantage of the lifted censorship laws on literature in the sixties. ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' by [[David Reuben, M.D.]] took the number one spot, winning out over The ''[[New English Bible]]'' at number two, a book just as controversial. The ''[[New English Bible]]'' completely abandoned the conservative interpretation and traditional Bible phrasing for contemporary wording and modern analogy.

The exposé became a popular bestseller tool, hitting its high point with the 1974 number two non-fiction best seller, ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], two journalists that exposed [[Richard Nixon]] and the Watergate scandal. At number one was ''[[The Total Woman]]'' by [[Marabel Morgan]], which marked the beginning of the conservative right’s counterattack on the sixties liberation and the seventies retreat from [[traditional values]]. The exposés throughout the seventies unveiled much of American society's secrets, including the treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the corporate world, and baseball, to name a few. A revealing exposé in 1979 finally reached the most esteemed rooms of the country, with ''[[The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court]]'' by [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Scott Armstrong (journalist)|Scott Armstrong]].

Self-help and diet books replaced the cookbooks and home fix-it manuals that topped the sixties's charts, and starting in 1972 there were at least two self-help books on every non-fiction top ten list through 1979, starting with ''[[I'm OK, You're OK]]'', by [[Thomas Anthony Harris]] and ending with ''[[How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years]]'' by [[Howard J. Ruff]]. ''[[Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution]]'' started the bestseller health craze in 1972, with multiple diet and exercise books throughout the decade, ending with ''[[The Complete Book of Running]]'' by [[James Fixx]] in 1978, and ''[[The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet]]'' in 1979.

[[File:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|300px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Mathematical beauty''' describes the notion that some [[mathematician]]s may derive [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure from their work, and from [[mathematics]] in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as ''beautiful''. Mathematicians describe mathematics as an [[art]] form or, at a minimum, as a [[creativity|creative activity]]. Comparisons are often made with [[music]] and [[poetry]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:

Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1919|page=60|chapter=The Study of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Mathematics+rightly+viewed+possesses+not+only+truth+but+supreme+beauty+a+beauty+cold+and+austere+like+that+of+sculpture+without+appeal+to+any+part+of+our+weaker+nature+without+the+gorgeous+trappings+inauthor:Russell|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the [[ineffability]] of mathematics when he said, "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2000|page=140|chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C|accessdate=2008-08-22|isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty in method==
Mathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] as ''[[Elegance|elegant]]''. Depending on context, this may mean:

* A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
* A proof that is unusually succinct.
* A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or collection of theorems).
* A proof that is based on new and original insights.
* A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

In the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the [[Pythagorean theorem]], with hundreds of proofs having been published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisha Scott Loomis]] published over 360 proofs in his book Pythagorean Proposition ({{isbn|0-873-53036-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of [[quadratic reciprocity]]—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.

Conversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful [[axiom]]s or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called ''ugly'' or ''clumsy''.

==Beauty in results==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermat's last theorem]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerIdentity2.svg|thumb|right|Starting at ''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, travelling at the velocity ''i'' relative to one's position for the length of time π, and adding 1, one arrives at 0. (The diagram is an [[Argand diagram]])]]
Some mathematicians{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=173}} see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as ''deep''.

While it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is [[Euler's identity]]:&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News online|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display=block&gt;\displaystyle e^{i \pi} +1 = 0\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of [[Euler's formula]], which the physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called "our jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard P.|last= Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume=I|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1977|isbn=0-201-02010-6|pages=22–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern examples include the [[modularity theorem]], which establishes an important connection between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s (work on which led to the awarding of the [[Wolf Prize]] to [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Robert Langlands]]), and "[[monstrous moonshine]]", which connects the [[Monster group]] to [[modular function]]s via [[string theory]] for which [[Richard Borcherds]] was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

Other examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's [[Theorema Egregium]] is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon ([[curvature]]) to a global phenomenon ([[area]]) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (and its vector versions including [[Green's theorem]] and [[Stokes' theorem]]).

The opposite of ''deep'' is ''trivial''. A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the [[empty set]]. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.

In his ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses "inevitability", "unexpectedness", and "economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Mathematician's Apology|author=Hardy, G.H. | chapter = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:
{{quote|A great many theorems of mathematics, when first published, appear to be surprising; thus for example some twenty years ago [from 1977] the proof of the existence of [[Exotic sphere|non-equivalent differentiable structures]] on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising, but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful, then or now.{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=172}} }}
Perhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:
{{quote|It is very difficult to find an analogous invention in the past to [[Milnor]]'s beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven-dimensional sphere... The original proof of Milnor was not very constructive, but later E. Briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Monastyrsky|title=Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.

==Beauty in experience==
[[File:Compound of five cubes.png|thumb|222px|A "cold and austere beauty" has been attributed to the [[compound of five cubes]]]]
{{tone|section|date=March 2013}}
Interest in [[pure mathematics]] separate from [[Empirical research|empirical]] study has been part of the experience [[History of mathematics|of various civilizations]], including that of the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], who "did mathematics for the beauty of it".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic pleasure that [[mathematical physicist]]s tend to experience in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] has been attributed (by [[Paul Dirac]], among others) to its "great mathematical beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the [[reality|physical reality]] of objects are represented by [[mathematical models]]. [[Group theory]], developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving [[polynomial]] equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing [[elementary particle]]s—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of [[knot theory|knots]] provides important insights into [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Some believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=George|title=Mathematics Is Not a Spectator Sport|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-387-25528-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=psFwdN6V6icC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=there+is+nothing+in+the+world+of+mathematics+that+corresponds+to+an+audience+in+a+concert+hall,+where+the+passive+listen+to+the+active.+Happily,+mathematicians+are+all+doers,+not+spectators.|accessdate=2008-08-22|quote="...there is nothing in the world of mathematics that corresponds to an audience in a concert hall, where the passive listen to the active. Happily, mathematicians are all ''doers'', not spectators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some teachers that encourage [[student engagement]] by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see [[kinesthetic learning]]). For example, [[Math Circle]] is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on [[symmetry]] designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.

Some teachers prefer to use [[mathematical manipulatives]] to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include [[algebra tiles]], [[cuisenaire rods]], and [[pattern blocks]]. For example, one can teach the method of [[completing the square]] by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, E. (1989). Effects of Manipulative Materials in Mathematics Instruction. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 20, 498–505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example involves [[origami]]. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the [[mathematics of paper folding]] by observing the [[crease pattern]] on unfolded origami pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Thomas. "Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics". Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorics]] (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Brualdi, Richard. "Introductory Combinatorics." Pearson, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:
* [[Four color theorem]]
* [[Young tableau]]
* [[Permutohedron]]
* [[Graph theory]]
* [[Partition of a set]]

==Beauty and philosophy==
Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:
{{quote|There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture – that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.
|[[William Kingdon Clifford]], from a lecture to the Royal Institution titled "Some of the conditions of mental development"}}
These mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the [[natural numbers]] is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming [[mysticism]].

[[Pythagoras#Mathematics|Pythagorean mathematicians]] believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of [[irrational number]]s was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean [[world view]] did not contemplate the [[Limit of a sequence|limits of infinite sequences]] of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a [[real number]]). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as [[numerology]].

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.

[[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim "This one's from The Book!"

Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] claims that [[ontology]] is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

In some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the [[Solar System]] have been arranged by [[God]] to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, each orbit lying on the [[Circumscribed sphere|circumsphere]] of one [[polyhedron]] and the [[Inscribed sphere|insphere]] of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of [[Uranus]].

==Beauty and mathematical information theory==
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] analyzed links between beauty, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. ([[Aesthetics]] as information processing). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{isbn|3-211-81216-4}}, {{isbn|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on [[algorithmic information theory]]: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic]] descriptions (i.e., [[Kolmogorov complexity]]) relative to what the observer already knows.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. [[Low-complexity art]]. [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]], Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]), 30(2):97–103, 1997. {{doi|10.2307/1576418}}. {{JSTOR|1576418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Papers on the theory of beauty and [[low-complexity art]] since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) pp. 26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arXiv|0709.0674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidhuber explicitly distinguishes between beautiful and interesting. The latter corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty:
the observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[Data compression|compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial [[neural network]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.&lt;ref&gt;.J. Schmidhuber. Curious model-building control systems. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Singapore, vol 2, 1458–1463.

==Mathematics and the arts==
 {{Main|Mathematics and art|Mathematics and music|Mathematics and architecture}}

===Music===
Examples of the use of mathematics in music include the [[stochastic music]] of [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] in [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s [[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]], counterpoint of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[polyrhythm]]ic structures (as in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), the [[Metric modulation]] of [[Elliott Carter]], [[permutation]] theory in [[serialism]] beginning with [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and application of Shepard tones in [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Hymnen]]''.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Della Pittura Alberti perspective pillars on grid.jpg|thumb|Diagram from [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s 1435 ''[[Della Pittura]]'', with pillars in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] on a grid]]

Examples of the use of mathematics in the visual arts include applications of [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal]] [[geometry]] to [[digital art|computer-generated art]], [[symmetry]] studies of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[projective geometry|projective geometries]] in development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] theory of [[Renaissance]] art, [[grid (page layout)|grids]] in [[Op art]], optical geometry in the [[camera obscura]] of [[Giambattista della Porta]], and multiple perspective in analytic [[cubism]] and [[futurism]].

The Dutch graphic designer [[M. C. Escher]] created mathematically inspired [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and [[mezzotint]]s. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of [[infinity]], [[architecture]], visual [[paradox]]es and [[tessellation]]s. British constructionist artist [[John Ernest]] created reliefs and paintings inspired by group theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Ernest's use of mathematics and especially group theory in his art works is analysed in ''John Ernest, A Mathematical Artist'' by Paul Ernest in ''Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal'', No. 24 Dec. 2009 (Special Issue on Mathematics and Art): http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other British artists of the constructionist and systems schools also draw on mathematics models and structures as a source of inspiration, including [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] and [[Peter Lowe (artist)|Peter Lowe]]. Computer-generated art is based on mathematical [[algorithm]]s.

'''Microprinting''' is the production of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye.  To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of [[photocopy]], [[image scanning]], or [[pantograph]] typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale.  Microprint is predominantly used as an [[counterfeit|anti-counterfeiting]] technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by digital methods.

[[File:Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects.pdf |thumb|right |A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects published by Albert Boni (1943)]]
While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by [[Albert Boni]]&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Price |first1=Miles |title=The Microcard Foundation |date=April 1953 |volume=39 |pages=304–305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSQMvwRpV_8C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=microprint+originally+invented+by#v=onepage&amp;q=microprint%20originally%20invented%20by&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 October 2015 |publisher=American Bar Association |issn=0747-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space.  Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. ({{US patent |2260551A}}, {{US patent |2260552A}})  This process proved to produce a 6" by 9" index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing.  Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology.

==Usage==
[[File:USD100-microprint USA.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of microprint incorporated on US $100 paper currency]]
[[Currency]] commonly exhibits the highest quality (smallest size) of microprint because it demands the highest level of counterfeiting deterrence.&lt;ref name=trimm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trimm|first1=Harold H|title=Forensics the Easy Way|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DB82v7DdYygC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=Microprinting#PPA276,M1|isbn=0-7641-3050-1|page=276|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, on the series 2004 [[United States]] [[U.S. twenty dollar bill|$20 bill]], microprint is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side as well as the Twenty USA background.&lt;ref name=trimm/&gt;

[[File:Microprint.gif|thumb|left|''MP'' microprint commonly used on personal bank cheques]]
[[Bank cheques]] as well as various other items of value may also commonly leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size.  For example, personal bank cheques commonly place the characters ''MP'' next to the signature line of the check; these characters represent ''microprint'' and indicate that the signature line or other check features are actually microprinted characters. The microprinted characters are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficultly in being reproduced while the prominent MP serves as a overt deterrent warning that the item employs microprint.

While microprinting at some scales may be readable to the [[human eye]] without [[microscopy]], there is no differentiation between microprinting at these different scales.

The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The [[United States Postal Service]] in 1992.  It was also the first commemorative stamp wholly produced by offset lithography.  The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as ''USPS'' and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/blog/Chenevert_page_1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Security Features of United States Postage Stamps 1974-2009|page=1|last1=Chenevert|first1=James|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Engraving.jpg|thumb|Preparing a lithographic printing plate]]

Microprint of the smallest scale is only producible by hand using engraved [[offset printing]] plates or some other method of [[Intaglio (printmaking)]].

[[File:MICR char.svg|thumb|left|MICR]]

Digital microtext printers utilize specially designed fonts and ink for the purpose.  The ink used is most commonly [[MICR]] (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner particles but may also be [[Polyester resin|polyester]] based toners and [[styrene]] [[acrylate]] [[polymer]] based toners.  The ink is not limited to [[grayscale]] only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] or [[infrared]] radiation and producing [[fluorescence]] when exposed to those radiations.&lt;ref name=us7270918b2&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7270918|status=patent|title=Printing system, process, and product with microprinting|gdate=2007-09-18|fdate=2004-11-18|pridate=2003-12-24|inventory-first1=J|inventory-last1=Blood|inventory-first2=C|inventory-last2=Leonard|inventory-first3=J|inventory-last3=Crichton|inventory-first4=T|inventory-last4=Plutchak|inventory-first5=G|inventory-last5=Rombola|assign1=Eastman Kodak Company|url=http://www.google.nr/patents/US7270918|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microtext and microfonts==
[[File:Microfont.png|thumb|right|Examples of several microfonts used in digital microprinting]]

Microprint of the scale capable by other printing methods cannot be produced by a digital printer regardless of the resolution of the device.  Some digital fonts are designed specifically for the purpose of microprinting.  These pseudo-microprint fonts are referred to as microtext.&lt;ref name=us7270918b2/&gt;

Xerox was acclaimed for developing a microtext font they claimed could produce characters 1/100th of an [[inch]] tall.&lt;ref name=xerox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xerox.com/innovation/news-stories/microtext/enus.html|title=Xerox Scientists Develop Microtext Font; Digitally Printing Tiny Words And Numbers Will Help Make Documents More Secure|publisher=Xerox Corporation|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1/100th of an inch is equivalent to 0.7227 [[Point (typography)|points]].&lt;ref name=inchpoint&gt;{{NIST-PD|article=Conversion Factors for Science, Engineering, and Industrial Terms|url=ftp://ftp.nist.gov/pub/dataplot/other/reference/CONVFACT.TXT|accessdate=2015-10-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Videojet Technologies released their 1650 High Resolution (HR) and 1620 HR Continuous Inkjet (CIR) printers, said to be capable of printing sub-pixel size characters as small as 0.6mm in height (equivalent to 1.7007{{overline|9}} points). The printers use a 40-micron nozzle that outputs more than 100,000 drops per second of ink.  While these printers make microprinting faster and easier to produce digitally, they still have not reached the true sub-pixel size of less than 1 point.&lt;ref name=videojet&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.pmpnews.com/news/enhanced-microprinting-technology-featured-latest-videojet-1000-series-release-150410|publisher=UBM Canon|title=Enhanced Microprinting Technology Featured in Latest Videojet 1000 Series Release|last1=Anderson|date=2015-04-09|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest scale microtext a laser printer can produce is 0.5pt.&lt;ref name=troy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.troygroup.com/contact/downloads/TROY_Microprint_Whitepaper_011609.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Comparison of Laser Printed Microprint Fonts and Practical Considerations for Use in Prescriptions|date=16 Jan 2009|page=3|accessdate=2015-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008060618/http://www.troygroup.com/contact/downloads/TROY_Microprint_Whitepaper_011609.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microstructures==
{{Expert needed|Science|section|talk=Microstructures|date=October 2015}}
Using gold [[nanoparticle]] inks on a glass substrate, scientists concluded that it was possible for them to control the production of print patterns to a scale of 2 microns.  After printing, the nano-particle ink suspension was heated using a [[Gaussian beam|gaussian laser]], as it was heated, the glass would expand due to the [[thermal conductivity]] of the gold nano-ink.  In further experiments, they were able to fuse the nano-particles together into a tighter formation a continuous conductive line.  Such experiments did not directly include font characters but could translate to such usage.&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|degree=D.Sc.|date=2004|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:27519/eth-27519-02.pdf|title=Transport Phenomena in the microprinting and laser annealing of Gold Nanoparticle Inks|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology|location=Zurich, Switzerland|first1=Nicole Renée|last1=Bieri|format=PDF|page=167&lt;!--appears as page 201 in the digital pdf, marked as page 167 on the page --&gt;|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_Allegory_of_Immortality_by_Giulio_Romano,_c._1540.jpg|thumb|The Allegory of [[Immortality]] by [[Giulio Romano]], c. 1540. [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]], MI, USA.]]
A '''monster''' is often a hideously grotesque [[animal]] or [[human]], or a [[Hybrid beasts in folklore|hybrid]] of both, whose appearance frightens and whose powers of destruction threaten the human world's social or moral order.

Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice the white bull Poseidon sent him to the god, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull, and she copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, [[Minotaur|the Minotaur]]). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human ([[Medusa]] and her sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Frankenstein's_monster|Frankenstein's monster]]), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.

Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as ''monstrophy''.{{r|CallForPapers}}

Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[Mummy#Modern mummies|mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Arminianism as five-headed monster.JPG|thumb|A polemical allegory presented as a five-headed monster, 1618]]''Monster'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''monstrum'', itself derived ultimately from the verb ''moneo'' ("to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell"), and denotes anything "strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil," "a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing," or any "monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_UsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=latin+english+dictionary#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20english%20dictionary The Rev. J.E. Riddle, ''A Complete English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary'', London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1870, s.v. ''monstrum'', Latin-English part, p. 399].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage==
In the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at [[Wake Forest University]], "monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage".{{r|Boyer}}

In the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of "divine displeasure", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being "an unnatural event" or "a malfunctioning of nature".{{sfnp|Beagon|2002|p=127}}

Monsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian [[Suetonius]], for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are "against nature".{{sfnp|Wardle|2006|p=330}} Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, "a visual and horrific revelation of the truth".{{sfnp|Staley|2010|pp=80, 96, 109, 113 et passim}}

In spite of this, mythological monsters such as the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] and [[Medusa]] are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and other belief systems, in which the divisions between "spirit," "monster," and "god" were less evident.

==Monsters in fiction==

===Prose fiction===
The history of monsters in fiction is long, for example [[Grendel]] in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' is an archetypal monster, deformed, brutal, with enormous strength and raiding a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots on examples such as the monster in [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] and the vampire in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]].

Monsters are a staple of [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]] or [[science fiction]] (where the monsters are often [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in [[nature]]). There is also a burgeoning subgenre of [[erotic fiction]] involving monsters, [[monster erotica]].

===Film===
{{main|Monster movie}}

====Pre–World War II monster films====
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hollywood's interpretation of Frankenstein's monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]]]]
During the age of [[silent film]]s, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Golem]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s. The film ''[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]'' featured a [[dragon]] that consisted of [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] models, as in [[RKO]]'s ''King Kong'', the first giant [[Monster movie|monster film]] of the sound era.

[[Universal Studios]] specialized in monsters, with [[Bela Lugosi]]'s reprisal of his stage role, [[Dracula]], and [[Boris Karloff]] playing [[Frankenstein]]'s monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as ''Man-Made Monster'', starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.

There was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by [[Peter Lorre]]), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]''.


[[Werewolf|Werewolves]] were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]''. [[mummy|Mummies]] were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[Serial (film)|serial]] did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life [[lizard]]s to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).
FRANKENSTEIN

====Post–World War II monster films====
[[File:Gojira 1954 poster 3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' film poster]]
In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post–World War II]] era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. One early example occurred in the American film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', which was about a [[dinosaur]] that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] film depictions, ([[Godzilla]], [[Gamera]]), British depictions (''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]''), and even [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] depictions (''[[Reptilicus]]''), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which was released in theaters January 18, 2008. The intriguing proximity of other [[planet]]s brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gigan]]), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the [[fish]]-man monster [[Gill-man]] was developed in the film series ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.
[[File:Obake Karuta 4-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Card from the Japanese game [[Karuta|obake karuta]], c. early 19th century{{efn|Each card features a monster from [[Japanese mythology]] and a character from the [[hiragana]] syllabary.}}]]
Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] brought [[Color motion picture film|color]] to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.

Occasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in films such as ''[[Monster Squad]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''. The Hulk is an example of the "Monster as Hero" archetype. The theme of the "Friendly Monster" is pervasive in pop-culture. [[Chewbacca]], [[Elmo]], and [[Shrek]] are notable examples of friendly "monsters". The creatures of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' scare children in order to create [[energy]] for running machinery, while the furry monsters of ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise and the pioneering anime ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. The book series/webisodes/toy line of [[Monster High]] is another example.
{{clear left}}

===Games===
Monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games and video games as enemies for players to fight against. They may include [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, extra-dimensional entities or [[mutant|mutated]] versions of regular animals.

Especially in role-playing games, "monster" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. [[Sentience|Sentient]] [[race (fantasy)|fictional races]] are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals/objects. Characters in games may refer to all animals as "monsters".

=== Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: women, work and leadership ===
Stead initiated and led the [[Australian Research Council]] funded project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work and Leadership (2011–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership - Architecture Theory Criticism History - The University of Queensland, Australia|url = http://atch.architecture.uq.edu.au/equity-and-diversity-australian-architecture-profession-women-work-and-leadership|website = atch.architecture.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This involved eight researchers –  Stead, [[Karen Burns (academic)|Karen Burns]], [[Justine Clark]], [[Gill Matthewson]], [[Amanda Roan]], [[Gillian Whitehouse]], [[Julie Willis]] and [[Sandra Kaji-O'Grady]] – and sought map women’s participation in the architectural profession in Australia, to understand why women are under-represented at senior management level, and to identify concrete strategies for change. The project resulted in scholarly publications and in the advocacy and activism project [[Parlour: women, equity, architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour - women, equity, architecture.|url = http://archiparlour.org/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender equality: Reading between the lines|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/gender-equality/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-11-14|first = Michael|last = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Equity: not just Parlour talk|url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/voice/equity-not-just-parlour-talk-20140602-39eh2.html|newspaper = The Age|date = 2014-06-10|access-date = 2015-11-14|first = Niamh|last = Cremins}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/topics/parlour-guides-to-equitable-practice/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8656">In France, the title of '''Official Painter of the French Air Force''' is granted by the French Minister of Defence to artists who have devoted their talent to aeronautics and space. It can be attributed not only to painters but also to photographers, illustrators, engravers and sculptors.

== Rights and particular benefits==
The title does not grant any right to compensation but provides certain benefits and special advantages:
* opportunity to work on the facilities of the [[French Air Force]];
* granted painters are considered, only under the Protocol, to the rank of [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]], untitled painters to [[Major|Commander]];
* The artist may attach to his signature a wing surmounted by a star, hallmark of official painters of the air and space;
* in connection with the DRHAA - "Sub-Directorate Accompagnement" and more particularly one of the services, the "Bureau Armée de l'Air dans la Nation" (BAAN).

The official artist has a moral obligation to include in its annual production some aeronautical nature works, serving the cause and the reputation of the military and civil aviation.

''' Approved painters''' are appointed for three years by a jury headed by the General Inspector of the Armed Forces (Air).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decree]] of April 29, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The jury, under the History Department of Defense, shall submit to the Minister for Defence the list of candidates for an initial accreditation, renewal of accreditation or tenure. The jury is composed of officers of the [[French Air Force]], '''entitled painters''' and personalities from art and / or aeronautics. To become an entitled painter, painters must have been approved over three successive periods of three years.

The maximum number of licensed painters is twenty, the number of entitled  painters is not limited.

== History ==
The "body of painters, engravers and sculptors of the Department of the Air" (or "Armies' painters, Air specialty") was created in 1931 by the Air Minister Jean-Louis Dumesnil.

An official meeting is held every two years and is the location and privileged manifestation of the Air Painters' artistic commitment. It takes place under the authority of the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Ministry of Defence]].

In 1987, the "Painters of the Air and Space" association is created to fulfill a need to independently develop links with state or private organizations with aeronautical vocation, to bring an amateur public by putting up exhibitions and uphold the moral and material interests of its members.

A traveling exhibition managed by the French armies' Information and public relations service] and a blog [http://peintresairespace.blogspot.com/] now complete representation of the association.

'''Remarks on Colour''' ({{lang-de|Bemerkungen über die Farben}}) was one of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s last works, written during a visit to [[Vienna]] in 1950 while dying of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/ghcc/research/global-arts/workshops/materialculture/a218.4finlay.pdf "Weaving the Rainbow: Visions of Color in World History"] by Robert Finlay, [[University of Arkansas]], at warwick.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that philosophical puzzles about colour can only be resolved through attention to the involved [[language-games]], he considers [[Goethe]]'s propositions in the ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'', and the observations of [[Philipp Otto Runge]] in an attempt to clarify the use of language about colour.&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGinn | first1 = M. | title = Wittgenstein's ''Remarks on Colour'' | journal = [[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] | volume = 66 | issue = 258| pages = 435–453 | date=October 1991 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065104| jstor = 3751218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Goethe's theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory, rather it really isn't a theory at all. Nothing can be predicted with it. It is, rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in [[William James|James]]'s psychology. Nor is there any ''[[experimentum crucis]]'' which could decide for or against the theory. Someone who agrees with Goethe believes that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour. And nature here is not what results from experiments, but it lies in the concept of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ludwig |last1=Wittgenstein |author-link=Ludwig Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on Colour |publisher=University of California Press |editor=[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] |year=1977|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, he took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there are phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the "Farbenlehre", e.g. "White is the lightest colour", "There cannot be a transparent white", "There cannot be a reddish green", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, was discussed in [[Jonathan Westphal]]'s ''Colour: a Philosophical Introduction'' (1991).

{{cquote|There seem to be propositions that have the character of experiential propositions, but whose truth is for me unassailable.. There are, in any case, errors.. which must be set apart from the rest of my judgements as temporary confusions. But aren't there transitional cases between these two. If we introduce the concept of knowing into this investigation, it will be of no help; because knowing is not a psychological state whose special characteristics explain all kinds of things. On the contrary, the special logic of the concept 'knowing' is not that of a psychological state. (Wittgenstein, pp. III.348-350)}}

Although ''Remarks on Colour'' is considered difficult on account of its fragmentation,&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"/&gt; his last work, ''[[On Certainty]]'' (German: Über Gewissheit) is considered to be his most lucid.

The '''Samuel Badger Monument''' is one of the most distinctive examples of funerary art in the United States state of [[Maine]].  Located in a small private cemetery in [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]], it depicts the locally important shipbuilding magnate Samuel Badger (1794-1857).  The monument was designed by David M. French of [[Newmarket, New Hampshire]], and was completed in 1858.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Description and history==
The Samuel Badger Monument is located in a small private cemetery in a residential area of Kittery Foreside, a village of Kittery on the banks of the [[Piscataqua River]], not far from [[Badger's Island]].  The cemetery has a small number of graves, which all appear to be related to Samuel Badger and his immediate family, many of whom predeceased him.  The cemetery is surrounded by houses, and is not readily accessible to the public.  The monument is a stepped rectangular granite shaft, set on a granite foundation.  In a niche on one side with a curved ceiling stands a marble bust of Badger.  The tier at the base of the shaft has the Badger name in raised letters, and the next tier depicts a 19th-century sailing ship.  The shaft is topped by a low gabled pediment with a star at its center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_ari_323074|title=Smithonian Inventory Page for Samuel Badger Monument|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bust of Badger was designed by David M. French of [[Newmarket, New Hampshire]], and was installed in 1858.  The circumstances of its commissioning are not known.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;NRHP nomination for Samuel Badger Monument (redacted); available by request from the National Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Badger was one of the major shipbuilders on the Piscataqua River in the mid-19th century.  He was the nephew of [[William Badger (shipbuilder)|William Badger]], a shipbuilder for whom Badger's Island is named.  He served for many years under his uncle at his shipyard, and took over that business upon the elder Badger's death in 1830.  From then until his own death in 1857, the Badger shipyard produced 45 [[packet ship]]s.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

'''Shevchenko National Prize''' ({{lang-uk|Націона́льна пре́мія Украї́ни і́мені Тараса́ Шевче́нка}}; also ''Shevchenko Award'') is the highest state prize of [[Ukraine]] for works of culture and arts awarded since 1961. It is named after the inspirer of Ukrainian national revival [[Taras Shevchenko]]. It is one of the five state prizes of Ukraine that are awarded for achievements in various fields.

==History==
{{moresources|section|date=October 2016}}
In May 1961 the Soviet Union was honoring on a large scale the memory of Ukrainian Kobzar [[Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko]].&lt;ref name=lrl&gt;[http://www.library.lg.ua/rus/izdaniya_ukazateli.php?filename=2007_07_06_15_40_39.html&amp;name=%D2%E2%EE%F0%F6%FB+%CB%F3%E3%E0%ED%F9%E8%ED%FB+-+%EB%E0%F3%F0%E5%E0%F2%FB+%C3%EE%F1%F3%E4%E0%F0%F1%F2%E2%E5%ED%ED%EE%E9+%EF%F0%E5%EC%E8%E8 Art creators of Luhansk region &amp;ndash; laureates of the State prize]{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. Gorki Luhansk Oblast Universal Scientific Library, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A century from the day of his death became the reason for conducting festive events not only in Ukraine, but throughout the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=lrl/&gt; 

Thus, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] used the people's love for the great poet with goals of propaganda for "successes of Lenin National Policy" (such as the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia]]), but it had to consider the national sentiments of [[Ukrainian people]].&lt;ref name=lrl/&gt; Such atmosphere contributed to that on May 20, 1961 the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR]] issued a resolution "About establishing annual Shevchenko Republican Prize".&lt;ref name=index&gt;Klymenko, T., Martyniuk, A. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309145621/http://library.zu.edu.ua/Shevchenko.html Thought. Work. Reward: Scientific bibliographic index]''. Franko Zhytomyr State University, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrl/&gt; At the same time there was adopted the Provision on prizes and examples of honoring badges with diplomas for laureates; also there was established a government committee headed by Oleksiy Korniychuk, which consisted along with the party's officials prominent figures of [[Ukrainian culture]].&lt;ref name=lrl/&gt; It was awarded to the prominent performers of literature, arts, music, theater, cinematography, architecture, and others.

The first laureates received the Prize on March 9, 1962. They were [[Pavlo Tychyna]] (recent speaker of [[Verkhovna Rada]]) and  [[Oles Honchar|Oleksandr Honchar]] in literature, and Platon Mayboroda in music.

As of April 23, 1969 the award was renamed the Shevchenko State Prize of Ukrainian SSR. By the order of the President of Ukraine #800/2000 on June 22, 2000 the award became known as the Shevchenko National Prize. 

From 1962 to 2007 the award was given to 566 people and eight collective ensembles.

The '''''Southern apse from Pedret''''' is a [[fresco]] painting which was acquired during the 1919-1923 campaign of the Junta de Museus. The artwork originated from the southern [[apsidiole]] of the Church of [[Sant Quirze de Pedret]] and is currently exhibited in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque Art]] collection at the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya]], Barcelona, Spain.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"&gt;MNAC Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the end of the eleventh century, the Romanesque mural painting of northern [[Italy]] arrived in [[Catalonia]] with a spread similar to that of Lombardic Romanesque architecture. The work of Italian painters, then, accompanied the architecture and soon had important repercussions.

The clearest example of this Lombardy-related painting is the [[Sant Quirze de Pedret]] ensemble, which stylistically comes close to the paintings of [[Sant Pere in Àger]], [[Santa Maria in Àneu]], and [[Sant Pere in El Burgal]], and to those of [[Saint-Lizier in Couserans]] ([[France]]), preserved in situ.

The church at [[Pedret]], located in the [[Pyrenees]], was thought to have been elaborately decorated (even without a written history of worshippers) since it was located on the roads connecting [[Berga]], [[Bagà]], and [[Cerdanya]], thus it may have been an important location. Scholars agree that the church's original architecture was [[Visigothic]] due to specific construction elements such as the horse-shoe arches, which divide the nave and give entrance to the apses, as well as the insulation of the apses themselves.&lt;ref name="Pijoan 1911"&gt;Pijoan, J., "A Rediscovered School of Romanesque Frescoes", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'', April 1911, p. 72-73, XIX, XCVII&lt;/ref&gt; However, an additional description of Mozarabic has been given as well to describe the architectural style.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"&gt;Miller, D.C., ''The Romanesque Mural Paintings of Pedret'', Parnassus, New York, March 15, 1929, I, III, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories on the age of the frescoes have been presented taking into account stylistic trends of the tenth through the twelfth centuries AD and renovations that took place on the church during those time periods as well.&lt;ref name="Post 1930"&gt;Post, Ch. R., ''A History of Spanish Painting'', Cambridge, 1930, I, P. 130-136; 1941, VII (2), p. 540-544&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum where the frescoes currently reside dates them to be from the end of the eleventh century to the beginning of the twelfth.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; Due to the fresco's age, it is probable that the Southern apse from Pedret is one of the oldest of all [[Catalonia|Catalan]] Romanesque wall paintings.&lt;ref name="Pijoan 1911"/&gt;

The [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] keeps the two side apses from Sant Quirze de Pedret and the [[Museu Diocesà i Comarcal in Solsona]] keeps the decoration of the central apse. Taken together they present an important apocalyptic series in which the subject of the Church is related to the coming of the Day of Judgement in a way that is not frequent, centering on the parable of the wise and foolish Virgins in the southern apsidiole.

== Description ==
The apse's dimensions are 325 x 315 x 320&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; and it contains several images although the most prominent one is a fragmentary image of the Wise and Foolish Virgins parable&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt; found in Matthew 25:1-13.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; Three of the five Wise Virgins' heads have been removed due to historic construction on the church building; however, all figures seem to be wearing similar embroidered [[dalmatic]]s and tunics with close-fitting sleeves that are worn below the open-fitted sleeves of the dalmatics. The Virgins are crowned with bridal crowns resting on caps and are seen wearing spiral earrings. The crowns resemble those found in Rome during the sixth century. Originally, all five Wise Virgins were depicted seated at the marriage supper with burning cressets in their left hands. The Bridegroom figure (Christ) is all but gone however his hand can be seen extending over the table. On the other side of the scene are the five Foolish Virgins. The Foolish Virgins are not clothed in the intricate dalmatics as the Wise Virgins, and they do not wear crowns. Instead, they don coifs that are arranged in folds over their hair. Also unlike the Wise Virgins, the five Foolish Virgins hold their cressets inverted with oil vessels hanging from them. Beneath the virgins is a pattern described as “medallions of beasts.”&lt;ref name="Post 1930"/&gt; A young figure is also pictured sitting upon a church with the head encircled by a nimbus ([[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]). There is a discrepancy as to whether the figure is male or female, and to the object that is held in the figure’s hand. Suggestions have been wand, lily or palm. What can be agreed upon is that this image is a personification of the church.&lt;ref name="Anthony 1951"&gt;Anthony, E.W., ''Romanesque Frescoes'', Princeton, 1951, p. 161-163&lt;/ref&gt; Trace figures of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary were once reported, but have since faded entirely although the inscription SCA (Sancta) MARIA was recorded.&lt;ref name="Post 1930"/&gt; An image of the [[Theotokos]] holding the infant Jesus was also present but was covered with mortar during repairs.  There is a fret pattern below the illustrated figures along with simulated drapery present. The apse's window is also decorated with a geometric pattern.&lt;ref name="Anthony 1951"/&gt;

== Composition ==
The composition of this painting is fresco transferred to canvas and the artwork is attributed to the [[Circle of the Master of Pedret]].&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
These frescoes are attributed to have created by Circle of the Master Pedret&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; and are said to be examples of the early Catalan school.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt;  Stylistically their frescoes are linked to similar Italian artwork and show signs of early Byzantine iconography as well as illusionism.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; The parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins found in Pedret is related to earlier religious illustrations such as Coemiterious Maius and the [[Rossano Gospels]]. In the parable, those who are wise and have kept their torches lit are received by the Bridegroom, whereas those who are foolish and who have let their torches become extinguished have been excluded from Paradise.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt; This is in reference to [[Judgment Day]] where only those who are prepared will be able to enter the Lord's house.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; This particular parable seems to become extremely popular around the eleventh century. Personification of the Church appears to be influenced by [[Mozarabic liturgy]], whereas reference to the ten virgins is found in other liturgies.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt;

A '''sphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Σφίγξ}} {{IPA-el|spʰíŋks|}}, [[Aeolic Greek|Boeotian]]: {{lang|grc|Φίξ}} {{IPA-grc|pʰíːks|}}, plural '''sphinxes''' or '''sphinges''') is a [[mythical creature]] with the head of a [[human]] and the body of a [[lion]].

In [[Culture of Greece|Greek tradition]], it has the head of a human, the [[haunches]] of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a [[bird]]. It is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its [[riddle]] suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hsc.edu/drjclassics/texts/Oedipus/sphinx.shtm |title=Dr. J's Lecture on Oedipus and the Sphinx |publisher=People.hsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallich, Martin. "Oepidus and the Sphinx." Oepidus: Myth and Drama. N.p.: Western, 1968. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an '''androsphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Ανδρόσφιγξ}})). In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Desmond. Pyramids and the Sphinx. [S.l.]: Newsweek, U.S., 72. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the [[Renaissance]]. Later, the sphinx image, something very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit often interpreted quite differently, due to translations of descriptions of the originals and the evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.

Sphinxes depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal [[tomb]]s or religious temples. The oldest known sphinx was found near [[Gobekli Tepe]] at another site, [[Nevalı Çori|Nevali Çori]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyavocado.net/eureka/stumbles/715-is-the-sphinx-12-000-years-old.html |title=Is The Sphinx 12 000 Years Old? |publisher=Dailyavocado.net |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624181828/http://www.dailyavocado.net/eureka/stumbles/715-is-the-sphinx-12-000-years-old.html |archivedate=24 June 2011 }} Archived.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly 195 kilometres (120 mi) to the east at Kortik Tepe, [[Turkey]], and was dated to 9,500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Birch in Istanbul |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/23/archaeology.turkey |title=Birch, N., 7000 Years Older Than Stonehenge: The Site that Stunned Archaeologists, The Guardian, April 2008 |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}}

The largest and most famous sphinx is the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], situated on the [[Giza]] Plateau adjacent to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] and facing east ({{coord|29|58|31|N|31|08|15|E|}}). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the date of its construction is uncertain, the head of the Great Sphinx now is believed to bear the likeness of the pharaoh [[Khafra]].

What names their builders gave to these [[statue]]s is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 B.C. inscription on a [[stele]] belonging to the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] lists the names of three aspects of the local sun [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of that period, ''[[Khepera]]–[[Rê]]–[[Atum]]''. Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity [[Sekhmet]], a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], with her likeness carved in [[granite]], which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[alabaster]] [[sphinx of Memphis]], [[Memphis, Egypt]], currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing [[Amun|Amon]], were built in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], where his cult was strongest.

The Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, Willis Goth. ''Book of the Sphinx'' (Lincoln:  University of Nebraska Press, 2004), 54, 59, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sphinx CdM Paris DeRidder865 n2.jpg|thumb|Sphinx. Attic [[red-figure]] [[pyxis]], 2nd half of the 5th century BC. From Nola (Italy)]]
In the [[Bronze Age]], the Hellenes had trade and cultural contacts with Egypt. Before the time that [[Alexander the Great]] occupied Egypt, the Greek name, ''sphinx'', was already applied to these statues. The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about Egyptian culture. [[Herodotus]] called the [[Sheep|ram]]-headed sphinxes '''Criosphinxes''' and called the [[hawk]]-headed ones '''[[Hieracosphinx]]es'''.

In [[Greek mythology]], a sphinx is represented as a monster with a head of a woman, the body of a [[lion]]ess, the wings of an [[eagle]], and a [[snake|serpent]]-headed tail.

The word ''sphinx'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Σφίγξ, apparently from the verb σφίγγω (''sphíngō''), meaning "to squeeze", "to tighten up".&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfi%2Fggw σφίγγω] at [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the γ takes on a 'ng' sound in front of both γ and ξ.&lt;/ref&gt; This name may be derived from the fact that, in a pride of lions, the hunters are the lionesses, and kill their prey by strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down until they die.&lt;!--: the following is garbled:the Sphinx has no "given name" and "proper name":This may be her [[proper name]], but ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' states that her given name was '''Φιξ&amp;mdash;Phix'''.)--&gt; However, the historian Susan Wise Bauer suggests that the word "sphinx" was instead a Greek corruption of the Egyptian name "shesepankh", which meant "living image", and referred rather to the ''statue'' of the sphinx, which was carved out of "living rock" (rock that was present at the construction site, not harvested and brought from another location), than to the beast itself.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=S. Wise|authorlink=S. Wise Bauer|title=The History Of The Ancient World| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.]]|location = New York|year = 2007|pages = 110–112|isbn = 0-393-05974-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a single ''sphinx'' in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck. According to [[Hesiod]], she was a daughter of [[Orthrus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+327&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 327]&lt;/ref&gt; and either [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] or the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], or perhaps even [[Ceto]];&lt;ref&gt;Who is meant as the mother is unclear, the problem arising from the ambiguous referent of the pronoun "she" in line 326 of the ''Theogony'', see Clay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2etBN0w0NGUC&amp;pg=PA159 p.159, note 34]&lt;/ref&gt; according to others, she was a daughter of Echidna and [[Typhon]]. All of these are [[chthonic]] figures from the earliest of Greek myths, before the Olympians ruled the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The Sphinx is called Phix (Φίξ) by [[Hesiod]] in line 326 of the [[Theogony]], the [[proper name]] for the Sphinx noted by [[Pierre Grimal]]'s ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology''.

The sphinx was the emblem of the ancient city-state of [[Chios]], and appeared on seals and the obverse side of coins from the 6th century B.C. until the 3rd century CE.

The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to&lt;!--any other area needs to be made specific--&gt; the Greek city of Thebes, asking a [[riddle]] to travellers to allow them passage. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the myth, and was not standardized as the one given below until late in Greek history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edmunds|first= Lowell|title=The Sphinx in the Oedipus Legend|year=1981|publisher=Hain|location=Königstein im Taunus|isbn=3-445-02184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naxos Sphinx with humans for size.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Sphinx of Naxos]], on its 12.5 meters [[Ionic column]], [[Delphi]], 560 B.C. (reconstitution).]]
It was said in late lore that [[Hera]] or [[Ares]] sent the Sphinx from her [[Aethiopia]]n homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the Sphinx) to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] in Greece where she asked all passersby the most famous riddle in history: "Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" She strangled and devoured anyone who could not answer. [[Oedipus]] solved the riddle by answering: "Man&amp;mdash;who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], Library [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D8 Apollod. 3.5.8]&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimal| first=Pierre|others=trans.

Who are the two sisters?" The answer is "day and night" (both words—''[[wiktionary:ἡμέρα|ἡμέρα]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:νύξ|νύξ]]'', respectively—are feminine in Ancient Greek). This second riddle is also found in a Gascon version of the myth and could be very ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Julien d'Huy (2012). [https://ehess.academia.edu/JuliendHuy/Papers/1949877/LAquitaine_sur_la_route_dOedipe_La_Sphinge_comme_motif_prehistorique._-_Bulletin_de_la_SERPE_61_2012_15-21 L'Aquitaine sur la route d'Oedipe?

Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a "[[Liminality|liminal]]" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.

In [[Jean Cocteau]]'s retelling of the Oedipus legend, ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]'', the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and [[Anubis]] ascend back to the heavens.

There are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and parodic interpretations of the Riddle of the Sphinx, and of Oedipus's answer to it. Sigmund Freud describes "the question of where babies come from" as a riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;'An Autobiographical Study', Sigmund Freud, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1963, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xkU5eiigOZoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=freud%20Autobiographical%20Study&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous riddle books use the Sphinx in their title or illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, ''Book of the Sphinx'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Maier]], in his book the ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' (1617)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maier|first=Michael|others=trans. Peter Branwin|title=Atalanta Fugiens|publisher=Johann Theodor de Bry|year=1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes the following remark about the Sphinx's riddle, in which he states that its solution is the [[Philosopher's Stone]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sphinx is indeed reported to have had many Riddles, but this offered to Oedipus was the chief, "What is that which in the morning goeth upon four feet; upon two feet in the afternoon; and in the Evening upon three?" What was answered by Oedipus is not known. But they who interpret concerning the Ages of Man are deceived. For a Quadrangle of Four Elements are of all things first to be considered, from thence we come to the Hemisphere having two lines, a Right and a Curve, that is, to the White Luna; from thence to the Triangle which consists of Body, Soul and Spirit, or Sol, Luna and Mercury. Hence [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhasis]] in his Epistles, "The Stone," says he, "is a Triangle in its essence, a Quadrangle in its quality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bharhut Gateway Sphinx.jpg|thumb|Buddhist sphinx on a [[stupa]] gateway, [[Bharhut]], 1st century B.C.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;]]
A composite mythological being with the body of a lion and the head of a human being is present in the traditions, mythology and art of South and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Deekshitar, Raja. "Discovering the Anthropomorphic Lion in Indian Art." in ''Marg. A Magazine of the Arts''. 55/4, 2004, p.34-41; [http://www.sphinxofindia.rajadeekshithar.com Sphinx of India].&lt;/ref&gt; Variously known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit, "man-beast"), ''purushamirugam'' (Tamil, "man-beast"), ''naravirala'' (Sanskrit, "man-cat") in India, or as ''nara-simha'' (Sanskrit, "man-lion") in Sri Lanka, ''manusiha'' or ''manuthiha'' (Pali, "man-lion") in Myanmar, and ''norasingh'' (from Pali, "man-lion", a variation of the Sanskrit "nara-simha") or ''thep norasingh'' ("man-lion deity"), or ''nora nair'' in Thailand.

In contrast to the sphinxes in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, of which the traditions largely have been lost due to the discontinuity of the civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditions related to the "Asian sphinxes" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of "sphinxes" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by [[Hellenistic art]] and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|a phase of Hellenistic influence]]. Numerous sphinxes can be seen on the gateways of [[Bharhut]] stupa, dating to the 1st Century B.C.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;"Sphinxes of all sorts occur on the Bharhut gateways" {{cite book |last1=Kosambi |first1=Damodar Dharmanand |title=Combined Methods in Indology and Other Writings |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195642391 |page=459 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OhtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South India, the "sphinx" is known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit) or ''purushamirugam '' (Tamil), meaning "human-beast". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an [[apotropaic]] purpose, just as the "sphinxes" in other parts of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart.|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the [[gopuram]] or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]].

[[File:Purushamrigachidambaram01.JPG|thumb|left|Male purushamriga or Indian sphinx guarding the entrance of the Shri Shiva Nataraja temple in [[Chidambaram]]]]
The ''purushamriga'' plays a significant role in daily as well as yearly ritual of South Indian [[Shaiva]] temples. In the [[shodhasha-upakaara]] (or sixteen honors) ritual, performed between one and six times at significant sacred moments through the day, it decorates one of the lamps of the [[diparadhana]] or lamp ceremony. And in several temples the ''purushamriga'' is also one of the ''[[vahana]]'' or vehicles of the deity during the processions of the [[Brahmotsava]] or festival.
[[File:Manokthiha (Manussiha).png|thumb|Burmese depiction of the Manussiha]]
In [[Kanyakumari district|Kanya Kumari]] district, in the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, during the night of [[Shiva Ratri]], devotees run 75 kilometres while visiting and worshiping at twelve Shiva temples. This [[Shiva Ottam]] (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and [[Bhima]], one of the heroes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

The Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the ''[[Sharabha]]'', a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god [[Shiva]] took on to counter [[Narasimha]]'s violence.

In [[Sri Lanka]] {{citation needed span|and [[India]],|date=February 2018}} the sphinx is known as ''narasimha'' or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with [[Narasimha]], the fourth reincarnation of the deity [[Vishnu]]; this [[avatar]] or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The "sphinx" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.

In [[Burma]], the sphinx is known as ''[[Chinthe#Manussiha|manussiha]]'' (''manuthiha''). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist [[stupas]], and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by [[ogre]]sses.

Nora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the "sphinx" is known in [[Thailand]]. They are depicted as upright walking beings with the lower body of a lion or deer, and the upper body of a human. Often they are found as female-male pairs. Here, too, the sphinx serves a protective function. It also is enumerated among the mythological creatures that inhabit the ranges of the sacred mountain [[Himapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himmapan.com/himmapan_lion_thepnorasri.html |title=Thep Norasri |publisher=Himmapan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Europe ==
[[File:La Granja de San Ildefonso Sfinx01.jpg|thumb|[[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], Spain, mid-18th century]]

The revived [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sphinx of the late 15th century is sometimes thought of as the "French sphinx". Her coiffed head is erect and she has the breasts of a young woman. Often she wears ear drops and [[pearl]]s as ornaments. Her body is naturalistically rendered as a recumbent lioness. Such sphinxes were revived when the ''[[Grotesque|grottesche]]'' or "grotesque" decorations of the unearthed  ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' of [[Nero]] were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the ''[[loggia]]'' of the [[Vatican Palace]] by the workshop of [[Raphael]] (1515–20), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman ''grottesche''.

The first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the [[School of Fontainebleau]] in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the [[Baroque|Late Baroque]] style of the French [[Regence|Régence]] (1715&amp;ndash;1723). From France, she spread throughout Europe, becoming a regular feature of the outdoors decorative sculpture of 18th-century palace gardens, as in the [[Belvedere (palace)|Upper Belvedere Palace]] in [[Vienna]], [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] in Spain, [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]] in [[Białystok]], or the late [[Rococo]] examples in the grounds of the Portuguese [[Queluz National Palace]] (of perhaps the 1760s), with [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]]s and clothed chests ending with a little cape.

[[File:Fernand Khnopff 002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|''Caresses'' (1896) by [[Fernand Khnopff]], a [[Symbolist]] depiction of [[Oedipus]] and the Sphinx&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/-/_AGlYSd0kETwGw |title=Caresses |author= Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |author-link=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |year=2017 |publisher=Google Arts and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sphinxes are a feature of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior decorations of [[Robert Adam]] and his followers, returning closer to the undressed style of the ''grottesche''. They had an equal appeal to artists and designers of the [[Romanticism]] and subsequent [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] movements in the 19th century. Most of these sphinxes alluded to the Greek sphinx and the myth of [[Oedipus]], rather than the Egyptian, although they may not have wings.

== Freemasonry ==
[[File:Sphinx at Salt Lake Masonic Temple, Utah.JPG|thumb|Sphinx adopted as an emblem in [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture]]

The sphinx image also has been adopted into [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture. Among the Egyptians, sphinxes were placed at the entrance of the temples to guard their mysteries, by warning those who penetrated within that they should conceal a knowledge of them from the uninitiated. [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]] said that the sphinx became successively the symbol of each of the gods. The placement of the sphinxes expressed the idea that all the gods were hidden from the people, and that the knowledge of them, guarded in the sanctuaries, was revealed to initiates only. As a Masonic emblem, the sphinx has been adopted in its Egyptian character as a symbol of mystery, and as such often is found as a decoration sculptured in front of Masonic temples, or engraved at the head of Masonic documents. It cannot, however, be properly called an ancient, recognized symbol of the order. Its introduction has been of comparatively recent date, and rather as a symbolic decoration than as a symbol of any particular dogma. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== In popular culture ==
* In the 1968 animated film ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra (film)|Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', [[Obelix]] scales the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], causing its nose to break off.

* The 1992 animated film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' depicts the construction of the Great Sphinx of Giza. In the film, a man is carving the Sphinx's human face just as [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] flies by on a [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|flying carpet]]. The sight proves such a distraction to the sculptor that he mis-hits the great statue, causing its nose to break off.

* The Sphinx as a monster make appearances in the fourth installment of both the ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter]]'' and the ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth|Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'' series, both novels involving the main protagonists confronting her in a maze.

* The Sphinx also makes an appearance in the 2016 film ''[[Gods of Egypt (film)|Gods of Egypt]]'', where it is voiced and motion-captured by Kenneth Ransom. It is found in [[Set (deity)|Set]]'s pyramid and poised to kill any who cannot solve its riddle:
{{quote|I never was, am always to be. No one ever saw me, nor ever will, and yet, I am the confidence of all who live and breathe. What am I?}}
:[[Horus]] and the character Bek bring [[Thoth]], the god of wisdom, with them, sure he will be able to solve whatever riddle is posed. Thoth stumbles at first, offering ''[[Orderliness|order]]'' and other suggestions before landing on, at the last second, the correct answer: ''[[wikt:tomorrow|tomorrow]]''. The Sphinx expresses its disappointment before residing.

'''Stencilling''' produces an image or pattern by applying [[pigment]] to a surface over an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface. The '''stencil''' is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which ''stencil'' is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with [[lettering|letters]] or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material.

The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although [[aerosol paint|aerosol]] or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil '''islands''' (sections of material that are inside cut-out "holes" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with '''bridges''' (narrow sections of material that are not cut out).

Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as '''pochoir'''.  A related technique (which has found applicability in some [[surrealist techniques|surrealist]] compositions) is [[Aerography (arts)|aerography]], in which spray-painting is done ''around'' a  three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment.

[[Screen printing]] also uses a stencil process, as does [[Mimeograph machine|mimeography]]. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called "stencils". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images.

==History==
[[File:Shole-zrad-2014.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Writing an Arabic phrase by stencil and [[cinnamon]] powder on Iranian dessert, [[Sholezard]].]]
[[Image:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|right|Prehistoric [[hand stencils]], [[Cueva de las Manos]] in Argentina]]
[[Hand stencils]], made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, are found from over 35,000 years ago in Asia and Europe, and later prehistoric dates in other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}} "The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world," said Dr Aubert. "Next to it is, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one," he told BBC News. There are also paintings in the caves that are around 27,000 years old, which means that the inhabitants were painting for at least 13,000 years."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pike, A.

Stencils may have been used to color cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in [[Katazome]] and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the [[Edo period]] in Japan.  In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to color [[old master print]]s printed in black and white, usually [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be colored by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 15, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written.

==Book illustration==

Stencils were popular as a method of book illustration, and for that purpose, the technique was at its height of popularity in France during the 1920s when [[André Edouard Marty|André Marty]], [[Jean Saudé]] and many other studios in Paris specialized in the technique. Low wages contributed to the popularity of the highly labor-intensive process.&lt;ref name=jj&gt;Jan Juffermans (2003). ''Kees van Dongen: The Graphic Work'' Lund Humphries Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85331-876-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When stencils are used in this way they are often called "pochoir".
In the pochoir process, a print with the outlines of the design was produced, and a series of stencils were used through which areas of color were applied by hand to the page. To produce detail, a [[collotype]] could be produced which the colors were then stenciled over.&lt;ref name=dp&gt;David Pankow (1997). ''Tempting the palette''. {{ISBN|1-933360-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pochoir was frequently used to create prints of intense color and is most often associated with [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/arb/archives/exhibits2/Pochoir/Pochoir.html The University of Cincinnati] The Art of the Pochoir Book, University of Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/pochoir/intro.htm Smithsonian Institution] Vibrant Visions, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerosol stencils==

Aerosol stencils have many practical applications and the stencil concept is used frequently in industrial, commercial, artistic, residential and recreational settings, as well as by the military, government and infrastructure management. A template is used to create an outline of the image.  Stencils templates can be made from any material which will hold its form, ranging from plain paper, cardboard, plastic sheets, metals, and wood.

===Official use===
Stencils are frequently used by official organizations, including the military, utility companies, and governments, to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles, and locations. Stencils for an official application can be customized, or purchased as individual letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows the user to arrange words, phrases and other labels from one set of templates, unique to the item being labeled. When objects are labeled using a single template alphabet, it makes it easier to identify their affiliation or source.

===Stencil graffiti===
{{Main|Stencil graffiti}}
Stencils have also become popular for [[graffiti]], since stencil art using [[aerosol paint|spray-paint]] can be produced quickly and easily.  These qualities are important for graffiti artists where graffiti is illegal or quasi-legal, depending on the city and stenciling surface.  The extensive lettering possible with stencils makes it especially attractive to political artists. For example, the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]] used stencils of [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]] and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages in a long-term graffiti campaign around the [[London Underground]] system and on advertising billboards. There has been a semi-recent trend in making multi-layered stencils with different shades of grey for each layer creating a more detailed stenciled image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html Crass Discography (Christ's Reality Asylum)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912012809/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html |date=2006-09-12 }} Retrieved on November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Also well known for their use of stencil art is [[Blek le Rat]] and [[Jef aerosol]] from France, British artist [[Banksy]], New York artist [[John Fekner]], world traveling artist [[Tavar Zawacki]] f.k.a. 'ABOVE', [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Andre the Giant Has a Posse|OBEY]], and [[Pirate &amp; Acid]] from Hollywood, California.

==Home stenciling==
A common tradition for stencils is in [[home decorating]] and [[Handicraft|arts &amp; crafts]]. Home decor stencils are an important part of the DIY (Do It Yourself) industry. There are prefabricated stencil templates available for home decoration projects from hardware stores, arts &amp; crafts stores and through the internet. Stencils are usually applied in the home with a paint or roller brush along wall borders and as trim. They can also be applied with a painted sponge for a textured effect.

Stencil templates can be purchased or constructed individually.  Typically they are constructed of flexible plastics, including acetate, mylar, and vinyl. Stencils can be used as children's toys.

==Military stenciling==
Stencils have been used in the military across most nations for many years and continue to be used today. They are used to mark up equipment, vehicles, rations, signposts, helmets, etc. One use of military stencils was the application of playing card designs to USA Airborne helmets during World War Two as a method to identify regimental units.

==Silk screening==

[[Silk screening]] is a type of printing on paper or [[textile]]s, in which an ink is embedded in the cloth.  The ink is controlled through the use of a stencil, which is placed directly over the paper or textile.  This process can only handle one color of ink at a time.  Therefore, multi-colored designs must be silk screened several times, with each interval taking time to dry.

==Micro/nanostencil==
{{Main|Nanostencil}}

Stencils are also used in micro/[[nanotechnology]], as miniature shadow masks through which material can be deposited, etched or ions implanted onto a substrate. These stencils are usually made out of thin (100-500&amp;nbsp;nm) low-stress SiN in which apertures are defined by various lithographic techniques (e. g. electron beam, photolithography).

[[Stencil lithography]] has unique advantages compared to other patterning techniques: it does not require spinning of a uniform layer of resist (therefore patterns can be created on 3D topographies) and it does not involve any heat or chemical treatment of the substrate (like baking, developing and removing the resist). Thus it allows a wide range of substrates (e.g. flexible, surface-treated) and materials (e. g. organics) to be used.

==Other stencil forms==
{{Main|Screen printing}}

A stencil technique is employed in [[screen printing]] which uses a tightly woven mesh '''screen''' coated in a thin layer of emulsion to reproduce the original image. As the stencil is attached to the screen, a contiguous template is not necessary.
{{Main|Airbrush}}
A stencil used in [[airbrushing]] called a [[frisket]] is pressed directly on the artwork. It can be used control or contain overspray, create sharp or complex shapes, but is not designed to be used more than once.

Wall stencils - to decorate walls and ceilings or create your own repeat for an overall modern wall pattern effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3873">The '''Symphony''' by the American composer [[Steven Stucky]] is a four-movement [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]].  The work was jointly commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].  It was composed from January through July 2012 and premiered September 28, 2012 at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Los Angeles]], with [[conducting|conductor]] [[Gustavo Dudamel]] leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Symphony' by Steven Stucky |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 26, 2012 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/26/entertainment/la-et-steven-stucky-box-20120926 |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ng |first=David |title=Steven Stucky marks return to L.A. with his very own 'Symphony' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 26, 2012 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/26/entertainment/la-et-cm-steven-stucky-20120926 |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work had its [[New York City]] premiere November 29, 2012, with [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]] leading the New York Philharmonic.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=A New Work Bares Its Secrets, With Feeling |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 30, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-plays-steven-stuckys-symphony.html |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of approximately twenty minutes and is composed in four connected [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Introduction and Hymn
#Outcry
#Flying
#Hymn and Reconciliation

Stucky had previously written four other symphonies, but has since withdrawn all of them, saying, "I wrote two when I was a little boy, and I have no idea what unholy mash-up those were.  Then I wrote a symphony when I was a senior in college, and then one for my doctoral thesis, and I'm sure those have been completely expunged from the record."  He therefore remarked "It was not sensible to call this piece Symphony No. 5" and elected to simply title the new work "Symphony."&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;  Stucky also described the piece as "old fashioned" and said, "It has recognizable themes which come back. That links it to the traditional form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oksenhorn |first=Stewart |title=Music Festival: A new start for new music in Aspen |work=[[The Aspen Times]] |date=July 21, 2013 |url=http://www.aspentimes.com/news/7360687-113/music-stucky-aspen-program |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is dedicated to the flutist [[Mimi Stillman]].&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: New York Philharmonic 2012–13 Season |work=[[New York Philharmonic]] |year=2013 |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/watch-listen/commercial-recordings/1213/release08.pdf |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the New York City premiere, [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the accessibility of the Symphony and called it "a fairly modest piece, a 20-minute, colorfully orchestrated work in four parts, played without break."  Despite giving the piece an overall positive review, Tommasini nevertheless opined, "Mr. Stucky perhaps achieved his goal of writing a graspable symphony too well. I was engrossed in the work right through, and Mr. Gilbert drew an exciting performance from the orchestra. But the music may give away its secrets too readily."&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

'''''The Bowls Player''''' is an 1857 bronze statue by the Danish sculptor [[Georg Christian Freund]]. It is a modern adaptation of classical sculptures of athletes such as [[Polykleitos]]'s ''[[Doryphoros]]'' and [[Myron]]'s ''[[Discobolus]]''.

The plaster model for the work and the first casting from it were lost in the fire which destroyed the [[Christiansborg Palace]] in Copenhagen in 1884. Three other casts are known to survive:
*[[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], Copenhagen
*[[National Gallery of Denmark]], Copenhagen
*[[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin - previously owned by the archaeologist [[Theodor Wiegand]] and now on long-term loan to his house in [[Berlin-Dahlem]], where it is displayed on the terrace as it was during Wiegand's lifetime

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Continuing.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Continuing alt text|Still from '''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd ''' taken from vdb.org]] --&gt;
'''''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' ''' is a [[video]] directed by Arthur Ginsberg and Video Free America involving footage filmed between 1970 and 1975 following the lives and marriage of Carel Rowe and Ferd Eggan. Originally shown as a 3- channel video, 8-monitor installation including live feed of the audience for [[The Kitchen]] in New York in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Gould. http://areachicago.org/ferd-eggan-1946-2007/,  Area Chicago: Ferd Eggan 1946-2007&lt;/ref&gt;  the edited video is now distributed by [[Video Data Bank]] and [[Electronic Arts Intermix]]. The edited video consists of an hour-long tape selected from over 30 hours of footage that includes both the footage of the marriage and subsequent consummation, shot from 1971- 1972, and footage of an interview of Carel, Ferd, and Ginsberg produced for [[WNET]]'s Video and Television Review in 1975. The video is most readily available as a 33:15 segment on a collection of videos and video segments produced by Video Data Bank, ''Surveying the First Decade: Volume One: Program 3: Approaching Narrative: "There are Problems to be Solved"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vdb.org/titles/continuing-story-carel-and-ferd-excerpt Video Data Bank, The Continuing story of Carel and Ferd&lt;/ref&gt;''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' is often classified as video vérité, somewhere in between [[cinéma vérité]] and [[reality television]], though the footage predates [[An American Family]], often considered the first example of reality television.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2957 Electronic Arts Intermix, The Continuing story of Carel and Ferd&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd'' blends modes of camera address, featuring shots taken by Ginsberg of the couple in private or among friends, as well as first-person camera confessional shots.&lt;ref&gt;Renov, Michael. "Video Confessions." The Subject of Documentary. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2004. 201-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg, through the recently founded Video Free America, received some of the first Sony [[Portapak]]s in America in order to shoot the footage.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Indiana. http://www.poz.com/articles/221_1548.shtml. POZ, Inside Agitator&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeking to film the making of a pornographic film, Ginsberg found Carel and Ferd, who were looking to make an erotic film from their wedding, in order to repay a man whose car Ferd had recently crashed. Ginsberg began shooting the day that Richard, an old friend of Carels, came by to talk about the wedding. This initial session was spontaneous, and in this instance Ginsberg says that in using video media, he was able to capture this footage impulsively, the video came about by chance. Though the footage is centered on the event of the wedding, the camera's insertion into the lives of Carel and Ferd before the event means that much of the footage anticipates the wedding self-consciously.&lt;ref name="Phillips_98_101"&gt;Phillips, Glenn. "Arthur Ginsberg and Video Free America." California Video: Artists and Histories. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2008. 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the footage is cut to highlight specific moments and events, most of the footage is edited straightforwardly so as to not interrupt the narrative flow, the limited editing testament to Ginsberg's belief that with videotape any editing at all is "sapping its strength as a real-time medium."&lt;ref name="Phillips_98_101"/&gt;

==Synopsis ==
''The Continuing Story of Carol and Ferd'' takes on a loose long-form narrative, with two main subjects in a circle of friends, primarily shot in San Francisco. Carel Rowe, a filmmaker and erotic film actress and Ferd Eggan, a queer junkie, seek to be married, in part for the "media show" of their marriage and in part, a genuine desire to express their love for one another through the legal union of marriage. The footage features several others in their social group, notably Richard, a previous paramour of Carel's, who appears in an attempt to convince Carel and Ferd to not get married, as well as in the actual marriage scene. The video also features several unnamed friends, often present and sometimes addressed during the filming. Both Carel and Ferd also mention many others in their circle, including Ferd's alleged lovers, a source of contention between the two. On camera, the two kiss, interrogate one another, banter, argue, and have sex. The camera documents their intimacy as well as interrupts it, as they address the camera directly and answer questions asked by Ginsberg, behind the camera. After a fight scene, Ginsberg asks an unnamed friend in the shot whether the couple is fighting because the camera is on, to which the friend replies; “Oh I don’t think they’re doing it because the camera is on, but the camera's affecting them." In the WNET broadcast the two refer to the camera as a catalyst for action, and that their behavior in the presence of the camera was performance of only certain realities. The wedding itself is shot with more jump cuts, interviewing guests and featuring multiple close-up shots of details of the ceremony. The ceremony is a combination of a [[Jewish]] service and a media show, referencing [[Marshall Mcluhan]]'s [[the medium is the message]]. The wedding footages concludes with loud and obviously staged shots of the consummation of the marriage. In this footage the camera men are present and visible, the camera's whirring is recorded, and the camera men shout directions at the couple.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd. Dir. Arthur Ginsberg. Video Data Bank: Surveying the First Decade Volume 1, 1972-5. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The WNET program ran the video with the earlier black and white shots interspersed with later footage of [[Jon Carroll]], Ginsberg, Rowe, Eggan in a video studio, edited to seem as though they were watching and commenting on the earlier footage. The first instance of later footage is overlaid with scrolling text that introduces the program as it is being broadcast. The scrolling text introduction reads:
"Video and Television Review brings you "The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd",  a documentary soap opera set in October 1970, when Carel Rowe and Ferd Eggan were about to "tie the knot" they invited a third partner to join the marriage, a portable video camera. Which for a while became the most demanding partner of all. For the next hour we join Carel and Ferd along with the tapemaker Arthur Ginsberg and Jon Carroll, the west coast editor of the Village Voice as they watch their story on tape again. It is a story about marriage, about sexual identity and about living too close to an electronic medium.”&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

Though the footage was taken and presented before its appearance on public television, the WNET program ran after the original run of ''An American Family'' on PBS, linking the two as examples of precursors to reality television, early attempts at introducing the camera into daily life.

'''''The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781''''' is a 1783 large [[oil painting]] by [[John Singleton Copley]].  It depicts the death of Major [[Francis Peirson]] at the [[Battle of Jersey]] on 6 January 1781.

The Battle of Jersey was the last French attempt to seize the island of [[Jersey]], and one of the last battles with invading forces from a foreign nation in the British home islands.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746 was the last pitched battle on the British mainland; the [[Battle of Fishguard]] involved a short-lived French invasion of Wales in February 1797; and a French expeditionary force fought at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]] in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The invasion was organised privately by Baron [[Philippe de Rullecourt]] but funded and supplied by the French government, and was intended to remove the threat that British naval vessel based in Jersey posed to American ships in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Approximately 1,000 French soldiers, commanded by de Rullecourt and an Indian, [[Mir Sayyad]], landed at La Rocque, [[Grouville]], overnight on 5–6 January. They occupied [[St Helier]] early on the morning of 6 January. They captured the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]], [[Moses Corbet]], in bed. Although Corbet surrendered, Peirson, the 24-year-old commander of around 2,000 troops of the British garrison, refused to surrender. As Peirson organised a counter-attack, a French shot killed him. Lieutenant Philippe Dumaresq of the Jersey militia took command of the British forces, which comprised detachments of the [[95th Regiment of Foot (1779)|95th Regiment of Foot]], [[72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders|78th&lt;!--renumbered 72nd in 1786--&gt; Highlanders]], and [[Jersey Militia]]. The British forces quickly overwhelmed the French, most of whom surrendered.

[[John Boydell]], a successful engraver and publisher and [[Aldermen]] of the [[City of London]], commissioned Copley to paint a large painting, {{convert|251.5|cm}} by {{convert|365.8|cm}}. The scene looks towards the final French resistance in [[Royal Square (Jersey)|Royal Square]], viewed along what is now Peirson Place, with the French soldiers taking their last stand around the statue of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. Further British reinforcements are visible on the hill at the top left. The statue and some of the buildings depicted still stand (some with bullet holes  caused by the battle).

Although Peirson was killed in the early stages of the battle, the painting shows Peirson (at the centre of the painting under the large [[Union Flag]], supported by other officers) being shot down leading the final charge, giving him a more heroic role and fate. To the left, his black servant Pompey avenges his master by shooting the sniper. It is believed that the depictions of the officers supporting the stricken Peirson are true portraits; the black servant of auctioneer [[James Christie (auctioneer)|James Christie]] was the model for Pompey, although it is unclear whether a black servant played a role (there is no suggestion in contemporaneous sources). Copley modeled the civilians fleeing to the right on his wife, family nurse and children.

Peirson became a national hero, and the painting drew crowds when it was first exhibited at 28 [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]] in May 1784, with admission charged at 1 shilling.  The [[Tate Gallery]] purchased the painting in 1864. Between 1989 and 2010, a copy appeared on the 10 [[Jersey pound]] note, and before that on the 1 pound note.

The '''tomb of Ture Malmgren''' (referred to in Swedish as ''Tures grav'')&lt;ref name="Hitta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tureborgen.blogspot.se/p/hitta-till-borgen.html |title=Hitta |language=Swedish |date=2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=tureborgen.blogspot.se |publisher=Tureborg Society |access-date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a structure located in [[Uddevalla]], [[Bohuslän]], Sweden. It is located by the foot of [[Fjällsätern]], near the center of the residential district of [[Tureborg (district)|Tureborg]] (which is named for [[Tureborg Castle]], a ruin atop the mountain's summit). [[Rock-cut architecture|Carved]] into the sheer cliff face, it was intended as the final resting place of the local politician and publicist [[Ture Malmgren]]. Despite his own wishes, Malmgren was instead interred elsewhere after his death in 1922, effectively rendering the empty [[rock-cut tomb]] a [[cenotaph]] of sorts.&lt;ref name="Hansson2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansson |first=Wilhelm |date=2002 |orig-year=First published 1968 |edition=3rd |title=Drömmarnas riddarborg |language=Swedish |location=[[Uddevalla]] |publisher=Villa Elfkullen Association |page=14  |access-date=22 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ture Malmgren (born in 1851) is primarily known as the founder of the regional newspaper ''[[Bohusläningen]]'', which remains in publication today. Other than his career as a publicist and journalist, he maintained extensive business connections, and was involved in many fields of politics, often radical. Among other things, he was the first chairman of the [[Uddevalla Suffrage Association]], chaired the Uddevalla City Council for many years, and campaigned as a candidate for the [[Riksdag]]. In addition to these engagements he was also a keen builder, and constructed several large buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1922 |title=Dödsruna över Ture Malmgren |newspaper=[[Bohusläningen]] |location=[[Uddevalla]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only [[Villa Elfkullen]] still stands – his large mock castle Tureborg burned down in 1950, and the faux-medieval summer residence [[Fjällhyddan]] was demolished later in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tureborgen.blogspot.se/p/blog-page.html |title=Fjällhyddan |language=Swedish |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=www.tureborgen.blogspot.se |publisher=Tureborg Society |access-date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these three main buildings, many other minor structures created by Malmgren are dotted around the surrounding landscape. One of these is a vaulted cavern cut into the grey rock of Fjällsätern at some point between the 1890s and the 1920s. Following his death on 3 August 1922, the local authorities decided against burying him in his intended final resting place, and instead he was buried at the nearby [[Eastern Cemetery (Uddevalla)|Eastern Cemetery]]. There, where he was joined by his wife [[Hilma Malmgren]] following her death in 1942, a large tombstone bearing his portrait was raised.&lt;ref name="Hansson2002"/&gt; The old tomb is now bricked up.&lt;ref name="Hitta"/&gt;

A '''Tristimulus colorimeter''', colloquially shortened to colorimeter, is used in [[digital imaging]], to profile and calibrate output devices.
It takes a limited number of wideband spectral energy readings along the [[visible spectrum]] by using [[optical filter|filtered]] [[photodetector]]s; e.g. [[silicon photodiode]]s.&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|last=Schanda|first=János|author2=George Eppeldauer |author3=Georg Sauter |title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|chapter=Tristimulus Color Measurement of Self-Luminous Sources|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch6|editor=János Schanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colorimeter with the known value of absolute error allows measuring (x,y)-chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors. Measured values are used for calculation of LCD profile coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13462/metod_programmnoy_kompensaciitehnologicheskogo_razbrosa_koordinat_cvetnostizhidkokristallicheskih_paneley.htm|title=Method of software-based compensation of technological variation in chromaticity coordinates of LCD panels|author=Zharinov I.O., Zharinov O.O.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=387–397|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, three glass filters whose [[transmittance]] spectra mimicked the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE]] [[color matching function]]s (shown below) were employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photoelectric tristimulus colorimetry with three filters|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Richard Sewall|last=Hunter|date=September 1942|volume=32|issue=9|pages=509–538| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-32-9-509|doi=10.1364/JOSA.32.000509}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[filter bank]] may be used to decompose the individual color matching functions if more accuracy is desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/103/6/j36epp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Spectral Response Based Calibration Method of Tristimulus Colorimeters|first=George|last=Eppeldauer|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=103|issue=6|date=Nov–Dec 1998|pages=615–619|doi=10.6028/jres.103.040|pmid=28009362|pmc=4890952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera or colorimeter is said to be ''colorimetric'' if it satisfies the {{Interlanguage link multi|Luther condition|de|3=Luther-Bedingung}} by {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther{{!}}Robert Luther|de|3=Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther}} (1868–1945)&lt;!-- 1868-01-02 (21.

Ives|Ives]] criterion"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aus dem Gebiet der Farbreizmetrik|last=Luther|first=Robert T.D.|authorlink=:de:Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther|date=1927|journal=Zeitschrift für technische Physik|volume=8|pages=540–558}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing [[metamerism (color)#Metameric failure|observer metamerism color errors]], if the product of the spectral responsivity of the photoreceptor and the spectral transmittance of the filters is a [[linear combination]] of the CMFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry|doi=10.1002/0470094745.ch5|page=154|first=Noboru|last=Ohta|author2=Robertson, Alan R. |isbn=978-0-470-09472-3|chapter=Measurement and Calculation of Colorimetric Values|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colorimeter or a digital camera with a [[color filter array]] can, under certain conditions, be used as an alternative to a [[spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=Imai1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Imai, Francisco H. |author2=Berns, Roy S.  | date = 1999 | title = Spectral estimation using trichromatic digital cameras | journal = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Multispectral Imaging and Color Reproduction for Digital Archives | volume = 42 | url = http://www.cis.rit.edu/research/mcsl2/online/Spectral/TechnicalPapers/SpecEstimRGBCamera_Chiba99.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solli2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Solli | first = Martin |date=16 December 2004 | title = Filter characterization in digital cameras | url = http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_liu_diva-2667-1__fulltext.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|observer conditions]] should be specified when citing a measurement (e.g. [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]/10°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oEsZiCt5VOAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22tristimulus+colorimeter%22+OR+spectrocolorimeter#PPA41,M1|title=The Colour Image Processing Handbook|first=Stephen J.|last=Sangwine|author2=Horne |author3=Robin E.
