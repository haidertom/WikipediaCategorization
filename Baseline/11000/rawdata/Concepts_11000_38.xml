{{Disability}}'''Ableism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|b|ə|l|ɪ|z|əm}}; also known as '''ablism''',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, "Oxford Dictionaries Online: 'ableism'", ''Oxford Dictionaries Online'', Retrieved 12 March 201h.&lt;/ref&gt; '''disablism''' (Brit. English), '''anapirophobia''', '''anapirism''', and '''disability discrimination''') is [[discrimination]] and social [[prejudice]] against people with [[disabilities]]. Ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non-disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, Simi (1998). ''Claiming Disability Knowledge and Identity''. New York: New York University Press. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, or [[character orientation]]s.

There are stereotypes associated with various disabilities. These [[stereotype]]s in turn serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]]s toward people who are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Wüllenweber, Ernst; Theunissen, Georg; Mühl, Heinz (2006). ''Pädagogik bei geistigen Behinderungen: ein Handbuch für Studium und Praxis (Education for intellectual disabilities: A manual for study and practice)'' (in German). W. Kohlhammer Verlag. p. 149. {{ISBN|3-17-018437-7}}. Retrieved January 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling affects people when it limits their options for action or changes their identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Geistige Behinderung - Normtheorien nach Speck und Goffman". Heilpaedagogik-info.de. Retrieved 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ableist societies, people with disabilities are viewed as less valuable, or even less than human. The [[eugenics]] movement of the early 20th century could be considered an example of widespread ableism. The mass murder of disabled in Nazi Germany's [[Aktion T4]] could be an extreme example of ableism.

==Etymology==
Originated from -able (in disable, disabled) and plus [[-ism]]; first known use in 1985-1990.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ableism.  Merriam-Webster. n.d. Retrieved 2018-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ableism . Dictionary.com. n.d. Retrieved 2018-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Germany ===
[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] signed the secret euthanasia program decree, [[Aktion T4]], in 1939 that allowed the killing of selected patients with chronic neurological, psychiatric disorders. This program took the lives of about 70,000 men, women and children with disabilities; this program was officially halted by Hitler in 1941 under public pressure but was continued unofficially out of the public eye, taking an additional 200,000 until the fall of Hitler's reign in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.britannica.com/event/T4-Program retrieved 2018-04-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, disability discrimination became unlawful as a result of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]]. These were later repealed, but the substantive law is replicated in the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Under the [[Equality Act 2010]] there are several types of discrimination that are prohibited. These are direct discrimination (s.13(1) [[Equality Act 2010]]), indirect discrimination (s.6 and s.19 [[Equality Act 2010]], [[harassment]] (s.26 [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[victimisation]] (s.27(2) Equality Act 2010), discrimination arising from disability (s.15(1) [[Equality Act 2010]] and failure to make reasonable adjustments (s.20 [[Equality Act 2010]]).

The legal definition of disability used in the law is:

''"A person (P) has a disability if P has a physical or mental impairment, and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities".''(Section 6(1), [[Equality Act 2010]])

Some conditions (such as blindness, [[AIDS]] and cancer) are included; others (such as drug and alcohol addictions) are excluded.

===United States===
Before the 1800s, perspective of disability was often in a religious lens. Individuals with disability were seen as evil or possessed by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/history|title=History Perspective of Ableism in America|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=looks to be a self-published site?|date=June 2018}} Much like many minority groups, disabled Americans were often [[wikt:segregated|segregated]] and denied certain rights for a majority of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knightpoliticalreporting.syr.edu/?civilhistoryessays=a-civil-rights-history-americans-with-disabilities|title=A Civil Rights History: Americans with Disabilities|last=Faville|first=Andrea|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s shift from a religious view to a more scientific view took place and caused more individuals with disabilities to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccj.org/ableism|title=Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=NCCJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public stigma began to change after [[World War II]] when many Americans returned home with disabilities and physical handicaps. In the 1960s, following the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights movement]] in America, the world began the [[Disability rights movement|disabled rights movement]]. The movement was intended to give all individuals with disabilities equal rights and opportunities. Until the 1970s, ableism in the [[United States]] was often codified into law. For example, in many jurisdictions, so-called "[[ugly law]]s" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.rootedinrights.org/the-ugly-laws-disability-in-public/ Retrieved 2018-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ====

Section 504 and other sections of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] enacted into law certain [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties for failing to make public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG). These laws prohibit direct discrimination against disabled people in government programs, employment, public transit and public accommodations like stores and restaurants.

==== Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act ====
The [[Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act]] was passed to promote the fundamental right to vote by improving access for [[handicapped]] and [[elderly]] individuals to registration facilities and polling places for Federal elections by requiring access to polling places used in [[Federal elections in the United States|Federal elections]] and available registration and voting aids, such as instructions in large type &lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm Retrieved 2018-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ====
The federal [[Fair Housing Act (United States)|Fair Housing Amendments Act]] of 1988 prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of disability and requires that newly constructed multi-family housing meet certain access guidelines while requiring landlords to allow disabled persons to modify existing dwellings for accessibility.

==== Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ====
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was passed in on July 26, 1990 by the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration and amended on January 1, 2009. The act gave individuals with disabilities civil rights protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov|title=ADA.gov homepage|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ====
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a four-part (A-D) piece of American legislation that ensures students with a disability are provided with [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE) that is tailored to their individual needs. IDEA was previously known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EHA) from 1975 to 1990. In 1990, the United States Congress reauthorized EHA and changed the title to IDEA (Public Law No. 94-142). Overall, the goal of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities the same opportunity for education as those students who do not have a disability.

=== Workplace ===

In 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] was put in place to prohibit private employers, state and local government, employment agencies and labor unions from discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in job applications, when hiring, firing, advancement in workplace, compensation, training, and on other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.ada.gov/ada_title_I.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], also known as the EEOC also plays a part in fighting against ableism by being responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite legislation to reduce disability discrimination, roughly 13.3 million Americans with disabilities report difficulty finding a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/facts|title=Facts About Institutional Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===
Ableism often makes the world unwelcoming, and inaccessible to people with disabilities—especially in schools. An ableist would assert that children with disabilities need to assimilate to normative culture. For example, a student who experiences a disability needs to read text instead of listening to a tape recording of the text. In the past, schools focused too much on fixing the disability, but due to progressive reforms, school’s goals are centered on minimizing the impact of a student’s disability, and giving support, skills, and opportunities to live a full life. Moreover, schools must maximize access to the school community as whole.&lt;ref&gt;IDEA. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Congress made into law the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], which states that free and appropriate education is eligible to children with disabilities with insurance of necessary services.&lt;ref&gt;Hehir, T. (2007). Confronting Ableism. Educational Leadership, 64(5), 8-14. Retrieved May 2, 2018, from http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb07/vol64/num05/Confronting-Ableism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Congress later amended the law, in 2015, to include the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which guarantees equal opportunity for people with disabilities full participation in society, and the tools for overall independent success.

=== Media ===

Disabilities are not only misrepresented in the media but often underepresented as well. These common ways{{which|date=August 2018}} of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities. While roughly 20 percent of the population is disabled, only 2 percent of characters played in television and film have a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-ruderman-white-paper-on-the-challenge-to-create-more-authentic-disability-casting-and-representation-on-tv/|title=The Ruderman White Paper on the Challenge to Create More Authentic Disability Casting and Representation on TV|work=Ruderman Family Foundation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95 percent of the time, disabled characters are played by actors and actresses who are not disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodburn|first=Danny|date=July 2016|title=THE RUDERMAN WHITE PAPER ON EMPLOYMENT OF ACTORS WITH DISABILITIES IN TELEVISION|url=http://www.rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TV-White-Paper_7-1-003.pdf|journal=Ruderman Family Foundation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruderman Family Foundation is a [[Private foundation|private philanthropic foundation]] established in 2002 in [[Boston]], USA, managed by the [[Jay Ruderman|Ruderman family]]. The foundation operates in America and in [[Israel]] in two main areas: [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of people with [[disabilities]] in society and strengthening the relationship between Israel and the [[American Jewish]] community, while promoting strategic [[philanthropy]] and expanding circles of giving and involvement. The foundation has released a series of papers discussing various disability studies including disability in the media.

==== Disabled villain ====

One common form of media depiction of disability is to portray villains with a mental or physical disability. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, “that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.”&lt;ref&gt;Row-Heyveld, Lindsey (2015). [http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf "Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar"] (PDF). ''Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture''. '''15''' (3). [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1215/15314200-2917105|10.1215/15314200-2917105]]. Retrieved April 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The disability of the villain is meant to separate them from the average viewer and dehumanize the antagonist. As a result, stigma forms surrounding the disability and the individuals that live with it.

==== Inspiration porn ====

[[Inspiration porn]] is the use of people with disabilities as a form of inspiration when performing ordinary tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stella Young|Young, Stella]]. "Stella Young: I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much | TED Talk". TED.com. Retrieved 2015-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of inspiration porn say that it distances people with disabilities from able-bodied individuals and portrays disability as an obstacle to overcome or rehab.&lt;ref&gt;Rakowitz, Rebecca. "Inspiration porn: A look at the objectification of the disabled community | The Crimson White". ''The Crimson White''. University of Alabama. Retrieved 5 March2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kate (17 July 2017). "On Inspiration Porn". ''Huffington Post''. Retrieved 5 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Pitied Character ====

In many forms of media such as films and articles a person who experiences disability is portrayed as a character who is viewed as less than able, different and an 'outcast'. Hayes &amp; Black (2003)[http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/419/585] explore Hollywood films as the discourse of pity towards disability as a problem of social, physical and emotional confinement. The aspect of pity is heightened through the storylines of media focusing on the individuals weaknesses as opposed to strengths and therefore leaving audiences a negative and ableist portrayal towards disability.

=== Sports ===

[[File:Paralympic Runner.jpg|thumb|A runner in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games]]

Sports are often an area of society in which ableism is evident. In sports media, athletes with disabilities are often portrayed to be inferior.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw, K. P. (1997). The (in)visibility of disability: Cultural contexts and ‘‘sporting bodies.’’ ''Quest'', 49, 416–430.&lt;/ref&gt; When athletes with disabilities are discussed in the media, there is often an emphasis on rehabilitation and the road to recovery, which is inherently a negative view on the disability.&lt;ref&gt;Cherney, J. L., Lindemann, K., &amp; Hardin, M. (2015). Research in communication, disability, and sport. ''Communication &amp; Sport'', ''3''(1), 8-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Pistorius]] is a South African runner who competed in the [[2004 Summer Paralympics|2004]], [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|2012 Paralympics]] and the [[2012 Olympic games]] in London. Oscar was the first double [[Amputation|amputee]] athlete to compete in the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Klemko (10 August 2012), "Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal", ''USA Today'', archived from the original on 11 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While media coverage focused on inspiration and competition during his time in the Paralympic games, it shifted to questioning whether his prosthetic legs gave him an advantage while competing in the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, L., &amp; Watermeyer, B. (2008). Cyborg anxiety: Oscar Pistorius and the boundaries of what it means to be human. ''Disability &amp; Society'', ''23''(2), 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L. R. (2015).

Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general.

==In the visual arts==
Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100410114556/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714025231/http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a [[tensor]] is '''antisymmetric on''' (or '''with respect to''') '''an index subset''' if it alternates [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.F. Riley |author2=M.P. Hobson |author3=S.J. Bence | title=Mathematical methods for physics and engineering| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2010 | isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juan Ramón Ruíz-Tolosa |author2=Enrique Castillo | title=From Vectors to Tensors | publisher=Springer| year=2005| isbn=978-3-540-22887-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgGQUrQMzwYC&amp;pg=PA225 |page=225}} section §7.&lt;/ref&gt; The index subset must generally either be all ''covariant'' or all ''contravariant''.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ijk\dots} = -T_{jik\dots} = T_{jki\dots} = -T_{kji\dots} = T_{kij\dots} = -T_{ikj\dots}&lt;/math&gt;
holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.

If a tensor changes sign under exchange of ''each'' pair of its indices, then the tensor is '''completely''' (or '''totally''') '''antisymmetric'''.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor of [[tensor order|order]] ''p'' may be referred to as a [[differential form|''p''-form]], and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor may be referred to as a [[multivector|''p''-vector]].

==Antisymmetric and symmetric tensors==
A tensor '''A''' that is antisymmetric on indices ''i'' and ''j'' has the property that the [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] with a tensor '''B''' that is symmetric on indices ''i'' and ''j'' is identically 0.

For a general tensor '''U''' with components &lt;math&gt;U_{ijk\dots}&lt;/math&gt; and a pair of indices ''i'' and ''j'', '''U''' has symmetric and antisymmetric parts defined as:

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;U_{(ij)k\dots}=\frac{1}{2}(U_{ijk\dots}+U_{jik\dots})&lt;/math&gt; ||&amp;nbsp;|| (symmetric part)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;U_{[ij]k\dots}=\frac{1}{2}(U_{ijk\dots}-U_{jik\dots})&lt;/math&gt; ||&amp;nbsp;||(antisymmetric part).
|}
 
Similar definitions can be given for other pairs of indices.  As the term "part" suggests, a tensor is the sum of its symmetric part and antisymmetric part for a given pair of indices, as in

:&lt;math&gt;U_{ijk\dots}=U_{(ij)k\dots}+U_{[ij]k\dots}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==
A shorthand notation for anti-symmetrization is denoted by a pair of square brackets. For example, in arbitrary dimensions, for an order 2 covariant tensor '''M''',
:&lt;math&gt;M_{[ab]} = \frac{1}{2!}(M_{ab} - M_{ba}) ,&lt;/math&gt;

and for an order 3 covariant tensor '''T''',
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[abc]} = \frac{1}{3!}(T_{abc}-T_{acb}+T_{bca}-T_{bac}+T_{cab}-T_{cba}) .&lt;/math&gt;

In any number of dimensions, these are equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;M_{[ab]} = \frac{1}{2!} \, \delta_{ab}^{cd} M_{cd} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[abc]} = \frac{1}{3!} \, \delta_{abc}^{def} T_{def} .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, irrespective of the number of dimensions, antisymmetrization over ''p'' indices may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;S_{[a_1 \dots a_p]} = \frac{1}{p!} \delta_{a_1 \dots a_p}^{b_1 \dots b_p} S_{b_1 \dots b_p} .&lt;/math&gt;

In the above,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab\dots}^{cd\dots}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[generalized Kronecker delta]] of the appropriate order.

==Examples==

Totally antisymmetric tensors include:

* Trivially, all scalars and vectors (tensors of order 0 and 1) are totally antisymmetric (as well as being totally symmetric)
* The [[electromagnetic tensor]], &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; in [[electromagnetism]]
* The [[Riemannian volume form]] on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3828">In mathematics, '''BCI and BCK algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s, introduced by Y. Imai,  K. Iséki and S. Tanaka in 1966, that describe fragments of the propositional calculus involving implication known as BCI and [[BCK logic]]s.

==Definition==

===BCI algebra===
An algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast
,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\left( 2,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCI-algebra'' if, for any &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in X&lt;/math&gt;, it satisfies the following conditions. (Informally, we may read &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as "truth" and &lt;math&gt;x\ast y&lt;/math&gt; as "&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;".)
; BCI-1: &lt;math&gt;\left( \left( x\ast y\right) \ast \left( x\ast z\right)
\right) \ast \left( z\ast y\right) =0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-2: &lt;math&gt;\left( x\ast \left( x\ast y\right) \right) \ast y=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-3: &lt;math&gt;x\ast x=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-4: &lt;math&gt;x\ast y=0 \land y\ast x=0\implies x=y&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-5: &lt;math&gt;x\ast 0=0 \implies x=0&lt;/math&gt;

===BCK algebra===
A BCI-algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast ,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCK-algebra'' if it
satisfies the following condition:
; BCK-1: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in X: 0\ast x=0. &lt;/math&gt;

A partial order can then be defined as ''x'' ≤ ''y'' iff x * y = 0.

A BCK-algebra is said to be ''commutative'' if it satisfies:
: &lt;math&gt;x\ast (x\ast y)= y\ast (y\ast x)&lt;/math&gt;
In a commutative BCK-algebra ''x'' * (''x'' * ''y'') = ''x'' ∧ ''y'' is the [[greatest lower bound]] of ''x'' and ''y'' under the partial order ≤.

A BCK-algebra is said to be bounded if it has a largest element, usually denoted by 1. In a bounded commutative BCK-algebra the least upper bound of two elements satisfies ''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1 * ((1 * ''x'') ∧ (1 * ''y'')); that makes it a [[distributive lattice]].

==Examples==

Every [[abelian group]] is a BCI-algebra, with * defined as group subtraction and 0 defined as the group identity.

The subsets of a set form a BCK-algebra, where A*B is the [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] A\B (the elements in A but not in B), and 0 is the [[empty set]].

A [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a BCK algebra if ''A''*''B'' is defined to be ''A''&amp;and;&amp;not;''B'' (''A'' does not imply ''B'').

The bounded commutative BCK-algebras are precisely the [[MV-algebra]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">{{About|a design technique||Forcing function (disambiguation){{!}}Forcing function}} 
A '''behavior-shaping constraint''', also sometimes referred to as a '''forcing function''' or [[poka-yoke]], is a technique used in [[error-tolerant design]] to prevent the user from making common [[error]]s or mistakes.  One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving [[automobile]].

The microwave oven provides another example of a forcing function.  In all modern microwave ovens, it is impossible to start the microwave while the door is still open.  Likewise, the microwave will shut off automatically if the door is opened by the user.  By forcing the user to close the microwave door while it is in use, it becomes impossible for the user to err by leaving the door open.  Forcing functions are very effective in safety critical situations such as this, but can cause confusion in more complex systems that do not inform the user of the error that has been made.

When automobiles first started shipping with on-board GPS systems, it was not uncommon to use a forcing function which prevented the user from interacting with the GPS (such as entering in a destination) while the car was in motion.  This ensures that the driver's attention is not distracted by the GPS.  However, many drivers found this feature irksome, and the forcing function has largely been abandoned.  This reinforces the idea that forcing functions are not always the best approach to shaping behavior.

These forcing functions are being used in the service industry as well.  [[Call centers]] concerned with [[credit card fraud]] and [[friendly fraud]] are using [[agent-assisted automation]] to prevent the agent from seeing or hearing the credit card information so that it cannot be stolen.  The customer punches the information into their phone keypad, the tones are masked to the agent and are not visible in the [[customer relationship management]] software.&lt;ref name="adsit"&gt;{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1854&amp;Itemid=1&amp;Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Imperial unit|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|United States customary]] [[systems of measurement]] derive from earlier [[English units|English systems]] used in the Middle Ages, that were the result of a combination of the local [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] units inherited from German tribes and [[Ancient Roman weights and measures|Roman units]] brought by [[William the Conqueror]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066.

Having this shared heritage, the two systems are quite similar, but there are differences. The US customary system is based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial system was defined in 1824, after [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|American independence]].

==Volume==

Volume may be measured either in terms of units of cubic length or with specific volume units. The units of cubic length (the cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic mile, etc.) are the same in the imperial and US customary systems but with the specific units of volume (the [[bushel]], [[gallon]], [[fluid ounce]], etc.) they differ. The US customary system has one set of units for fluids and another set for dry goods. The imperial system has only one set defined independently of and subdivided differently from its US counterparts.

By the end of the eighteenth century various systems of volume measurement were in use throughout the British Empire. Wine was measured with [[English wine cask units|units]] based on the [[wine gallon|Queen Anne's gallon]] of 231 cubic inches (3.785&amp;nbsp;L). Beer was measured with [[English brewery cask units|units]] based on an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (4.621&amp;nbsp;L). Grain was measured with the [[Winchester measure]] with a gallon of approximately 268.8 cubic inches (one eighth of a Winchester bushel or 4.405&amp;nbsp;L). In 1824 these were replaced with a single system based on the imperial gallon.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wine gallons, however, continued to be used for tax purposes in the UK until the late 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Originally defined as the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|1|lk=in}} of distilled water (under certain conditions),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The water was to be weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at {{convert|30|inHg|0|lk=in}} at a temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=in}}. In 1963 these conditions were redefined such that the water was to have a density of {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} and to be weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density 8.136&amp;nbsp;g/mL.&lt;/ref&gt; then redefined by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]] to be exactly {{val|4.54609|u=L}} (277.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in), the imperial gallon is close in size to the old ale gallon&lt;!-- 1.6243% smaller --&gt;.

The Winchester measure was made obsolete in the British Empire but remained in use in the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally defined as the volume of a cylinder {{convert|18+1/2|in}} in diameter and {{convert|8|in}} deep, the Winchester bushel was redefined in the US as {{val|2150.42}} cubic inches.&lt;/ref&gt; The Winchester bushel was replaced with an imperial bushel of 8 imperial gallons.  The subdivisions of the bushel were maintained. As with US dry measures the imperial system divides the bushel into 4 pecks, 8 gallons, 32 quarts or 64 pints. Thus all of these imperial measures are about 3% larger than their US dry measure counterparts.

Fluid measure is not as straightforward. The American colonists adopted a system based on the 231-cubic-inch wine gallon for all fluid purposes. This became the US fluid gallon. Both the imperial and US fluid gallon are divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints or 32 [[Gill (unit)|gills]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gill is no longer in common use.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whereas the US gill is divided into 4 US fluid ounces, the imperial gill is divided into 5 imperial fluid ounces. So whilst the imperial gallon, quart, pint and gill are about 20% larger than their US fluid measure counterparts, the fluid ounce is about 4% smaller.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The now rarely used [[apothecaries' system]] of fluid measures further divides the fluid ounce into 8 [[dram (unit)|fluid drams]] or 480 [[minim (unit)|minims]]. Also in the imperial system there is a fluid scruple of 20 minims which is absent from the US customary system. Like the fluid ounce the dram and minim are about 4% smaller in the imperial system.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that one [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois ounce]] of water has an approximate volume of one imperial fluid ounce at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (16.67&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref group=note&gt;160 imperial fluid ounces is equivalent to one imperial gallon, which is the approximate volume of 10 pounds or 160 avoirdupois ounces of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;/ref&gt; This convenient fluid-ounce-to-avoirdupois-ounce relation does not exist in the US system.

One noticeable comparison between the imperial system and the US system is between some Canadian and American beer bottles. Many Canadian brewers package beer in a 12-imperial-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 341&amp;nbsp;mL each. American brewers package their beer in 12-US-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 355&amp;nbsp;mL each. This results in the Canadian bottles being labelled as 11.5&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz in US units when imported into the United States. Because Canadian beer bottles predate the adoption of the Metric System in that country, they are still sold and labelled in Canada as 341&amp;nbsp;mL. Canned beer in Canada is sold and labelled in 355&amp;nbsp;mL cans, and when exported to the US are labelled as 12&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz.

==Length==
The international [[yard]] is defined as exactly 0.9144 [[metre]]s. This definition was agreed by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand through the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.

The US survey [[foot (unit)|foot]] and survey mile have been maintained as separate units for surveying purposes to avoid the accumulation of error that would follow replacing them with the international versions, particularly with [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s. (The choice of unit for [[surveying]] purposes is based on the unit used when the [[Earth ellipsoid|overall framework]] or [[geodetic datum]] for the region was established, so that - for example - much of the former British empire still uses the Clarke foot for surveying.) The US survey foot is defined so that 1 metre is exactly 39.37&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es, making the international foot of 0.3048&amp;nbsp;metres exactly two parts per million shorter. This is a difference of just over 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm or a little over one eighth of an inch per mile.

The main units of length (inch, foot, yard and international [[mile]]) were the same in the US, though the US rarely uses some of the intermediate units, such as the [[chain (unit)|(surveyor's) chain]] (22&amp;nbsp;yards) and the [[furlong]] (220&amp;nbsp;yards).

At one time the definition of the [[nautical mile]] was based on the sphere whose surface is the same as the Clarke Ellipsoid.  In the US, the full value of 1853.256 metres was used, but in the Commonwealth, this was rounded to 6080&amp;nbsp;feet (1853.184&amp;nbsp;m). These have been replaced by the international version, which rounds the sixtieth part of the 45° to the nearest metre, as 1852 metres.

==Weight and mass==
[[File:English mass units graph.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|Relation of English mass weights to one another]]
Traditionally, both Britain and the US used three different weight systems:  [[troy weight]] for precious metals, [[avoirdupois]] weight for most other purposes and [[apothecaries' weight]] for medicines.  However, apothecaries' weight has now been superseded by the metric system.

One important difference is the widespread use in Britain of the [[stone (weight)|stone]] of 14 pounds ({{val|6.35029318|u=kg}}) for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence was seen in the practice, until World War II, of selling [[flour]] by a barrel of 196 pounds (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the ''[[troy pound]]'' ({{val|373.2417216|u=g}}) on January 6, 1879, &lt;!-- should this be 1 Jan? It's in Weights and Measures Act of 1878 --&gt;leaving only the ''[[troy ounce]]'' ({{val|31.1034768|u=g}}) and its [[decimal]] subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and [[pennyweight]] are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.

In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb), and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it. The tables of imperial troy mass and apothecaries' mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling "drachm" in the table of apothecaries' mass. The table of imperial avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound, but above that point the tables differ.

The imperial system has a hundredweight, defined as eight stone or 112&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|50.80234544|u=kg}}), whereas a US hundredweight is 100&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|45.359237|u=kg}}). In both systems, 20 hundredweights make a [[ton]]. In the US, the terms ''[[long ton]]'' ({{val|2240|u=lb}}, {{val|1016.0469088|u=kg}}) and ''[[short ton]]'' ({{val|2000|u=lb}}; {{val|907.18474|u=kg}}) are used to distinguish them. The term ''metric ton'' is also used to denote a [[tonne]] ({{val|1000|u=kg}}, {{val|2204.622|u=lb}}), which is about 2% less than the long ton.

[[File:Glasl's Model of Conflict Escalation.svg|thumb|[[Friedrich Glasl's model of conflict escalation]] and de-escalation]]
'''De-escalation''' refers to behavior that is intended to escape [[Conflict escalation|escalations]] of [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]]. It may also refer to approaches in [[conflict resolution]]. [[Escalation of commitment|Escalations of commitment]] are often hard from spiraling out of proportions without specific measures being taken.

==Verbal De-escalation in Psychiatric Settings==
De-escalation is aimed at calmly communicating with an agitated client in order to understand, manage and resolve their concerns. Ultimately, these actions should help reduce the client’s agitation and potential for future aggression or violence. An inadequate intervention, or one occurring too late, may leave staff needing to utilize coercive measures to manage an aggressive or violent client. Coercive measures, such as chemical or mechanical restraints and seclusion, are damaging to the therapeutic relationship and harmful to clients and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duxbury|first=J.|date=2002-06-01|title=An evaluation of staff and patient views of and strategies employed to manage inpatient aggression and violence on one mental health unit: a pluralistic design|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00497.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=325–337|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00497.x|issn=1365-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huckshorn|first=Kevin Ann|date=2006-07-01|title=Re-Designing State Mental Health Policy to Prevent the Use of Seclusion and Restraint|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10488-005-0011-5|journal=Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=482–491|doi=10.1007/s10488-005-0011-5|issn=0894-587X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the importance of de-escalation in promoting a non-coercive psychiatric environment, a review of the literature conducted by Mavandadi, Bieling and Madsen (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mavandadi|first=V.|last2=Bieling|first2=P.

Articles converge on a number of themes (i.e. de-escalation should involve safely, calmly and empathetically supporting the client with their concerns). Hankin et al.’s (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hankin|first=Cheryl S.|last2=Bronstone|first2=Amy|last3=Koran|first3=Lorrin M.|title=Agitation in the Inpatient Psychiatric Setting|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00131746-201105000-00003|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Practice|volume=17|issue=3|pages=170–185|doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000398410.21374.7d}}&lt;/ref&gt; review of four de-escalation studies reflected the somewhat unclear state of de-escalation research. Their review settled on eight goals, seven elements, 15 general techniques and 15 other techniques divided into three subheadings. Furthermore, a valiant attempt to synthesize the various models and definitions was conducted by Price &amp; Baker (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Owen|last2=Baker|first2=John|date=2012-08-01|title=Key components of de-escalation techniques: A thematic synthesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x/abstract|journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=310–319|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x|issn=1447-0349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic analysis of 11 eligible studies converged on seven themes: three related to staff skills (e.g. empathetic concern, calm appearance and gentle tone of voice) and four related to the process of intervening (e.g. establish rapport, maintain safety, problem solve and set limits). The available literature provides clinical descriptions of effective de-escalation based on qualitative data and professional observations. However, these thematic analyses need to be supported by more objective data; one hallmark of such objectivity would be an empirical scale or quantitative measure of de-escalation.

==English Modified version of the ‘De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale’ (EMDABS)==

1. '''Valuing the client:''' Provides genuine acknowledgement that the client’s concerns are valid, important and will be addressed in a meaningful way.

2. '''Reducing fear:''' Listens actively to the client and offers genuine empathy while suggesting that the client’s situation has the potential for positive future change.

3. '''Inquiring about client’s queries and anxiety:''' Can communicate a thorough understanding of the client’s concerns, and works to uncover
the root of the issue.

4. '''Providing guidance to the client:''' Suggests multiple ways to the help the client with their current concerns and recommends preventative measures.

5. '''Working out possible agreements:''' Takes responsibility for the client’s care and concludes the encounter with an agreed-upon short-term solution and a long-term action plan.

6. '''Remaining calm:''' Maintains a calm tone of voice and steady pace that is appropriate to the client’s feelings and behaviour.

7. '''Risky:''' Maintains a moderate distance from the client to ensure safety, but does not appear guarded and fearful.

The [[FIRST STEP Act]] [[prison reform]] bill mandates de-escalation training, especially for "incidents that involve the unique needs of individuals who have a mental illness or cognitive deficit."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5682/text#toc-H87691A1536ED4484BFE1B7193F9271A5&lt;/ref&gt;

This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], and deflecting the conversation to individuals in the group who are less passionately involved. This is commonly used by Fee Team in [[mental health nursing]] practice. It is also used as an anger management tool to remove tension between two participants in a conflictual relationship or intervention.

{{redirect|Domain (mathematics)|other uses of "domain"|Domain (disambiguation)#Mathematics{{!}}Domain (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|280px|Illustration showing ''f'', a function from the pink domain ''X'' to the blue codomain ''Y''. The yellow oval inside ''Y'' is the [[Image (mathematics)|image of ''f'']]. Both the image and the codomain are sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range of ''f'']].]]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[naive set theory]], the '''domain of definition''' (or simply the '''domain''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of "input" or [[Argument of a function|argument]] values for which the function is defined.  That is, the function provides an "output"  or [[Value (mathematics)|value]] for each member of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=Hiram |authorlink=Hiram Paley |first2=Paul M. |last2=Weichsel |title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1966 |page=16 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of the function.

For instance, the domain of [[cosine]] is the set of all [[real numbers]], while the domain of the [[square root]] consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring [[complex numbers]] in both cases).

If the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], then the domain is represented on the ''X''-axis.
[[Image:Square_root_0_25.svg|thumb|250px|Graph of the real-valued [[square root]] function, ''f''(''x'') = {{radic|''x''}}, whose domain consists of all nonnegative real numbers]]

== Formal definition ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex analysis]] --&gt;
Given a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the '''domain''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;; the set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[codomain]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  In the expression &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the '''argument''' and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''value'''.  One can think of an argument as a member of the domain that is chosen as an "input" to the function, and  the value as the "output" when the function is applied to that member of the domain.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] (sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range]]) of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values assumed by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for all possible &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; this is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f(x) | x \in X \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be the same set as the codomain or it can be a [[proper subset]] of it.  It is, in general, smaller than the codomain; it is the whole codomain if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surjective function]].

A well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has no value for &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the set of all [[real number]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; or the "gap is plugged" by explicitly defining &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If we extend the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
1/x&amp;x\not=0\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''f'' is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any function can be restricted to a [[subset]] of its domain. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, is written &lt;math&gt;\left. g \right|_{S} \colon S \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

== Natural domain ==
The '''natural domain''' of a function is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined, typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers. For instance the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calculus: basic concepts and applications|first1=Robert A.|last1=Rosenbaum|first2=G. Philip|last2=Johnson|page=60|year=1984|isbn=0-521-25012-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain of a partial function ==
{{further|Partial function#Domain of a partial function}}
There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a [[partial function]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', i.e. a function from a subset ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of ''X'' to ''Y''. Most mathematicians, including [[recursion theory|recursion theorists]], use the term "domain of ''f''" for the set ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of all values ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') is defined. But some, particularly [[category theory|category theorists]], consider the domain to be ''X'', irrespective of whether ''f''(''x'') exists for every ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''X''.

== Category theory ==

In [[category theory]] one deals with [[morphisms]] instead of functions.  Morphisms are arrows from one object to another.  The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts.  In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned or at least formulated more abstractly.  For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified.  See [[subobject]] for more.

== Real and complex analysis ==

In [[calculus|real]] and [[complex analysis]], a domain is an [[open set|open]] [[connected space|connected]] subset of a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] vector space.

In [[partial differential equation]]s, a domain is an open connected subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where the problem is posed, i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined.

== More examples ==
* As a partial function  from the real numbers the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If one defines the square root of a negative number ''x'' as the [[complex number]] ''z'', with positive imaginary part, such that ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all real numbers ''x''.
* Function &lt;math&gt;\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi, k = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front of the Supreme Court Building, including the West Pediment.]]
'''Equal justice under law''' is a phrase engraved on the front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington D.C.]]  It is also a societal ideal that has influenced [[Law of the United States|the American legal system]].

The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932.  It is based upon [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to [[ancient Greece]].

==Proposed by architects and approved by justices==
[[File:Van Devanter and Hughes.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Van Devanter (left) and Chief Justice Hughes]]This phrase was suggested in 1932 by the architectural firm that designed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Merlo.  ''Charles Evans Hughes'', Volume 2,  p. 689 (Columbia University Press 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] subsequently approved this inscription, as did the United States Supreme Court Building Commission which Hughes chaired (and on which Van Devanter served).&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|about/westpediment.pdf}}  West Pediment Information Sheet] via U.S. Supreme Court web site.  At that time, the other members of the Commission were Senator [[Henry W. Keyes]], Senator [[James A. Reed]], Representative [[Richard N. Elliott]], Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]], and Architect of the Capitol [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]].  See Liu, Honxia.  "[http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr40_3and4/CR40-3Liu.pdf Court Gazing: Features of Diversity in the Supreme Court Building]", ''Court Review'' (Winter 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by [[Cass Gilbert]], though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Priscilla.  "A Closer Look at the Bronze Courtroom Gates", ''Supreme Court Quarterly'', Vol. 9, p. 8 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]] who at that time held the position of [[Architect of the Capitol]], the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan "equal justice under law" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;McGurn, Barrett.  "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226111758/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/wp-content/themes/supremecourthistory/inc/schs_publications-1982.pdf Slogans to Fit the Occasion]", pp. 170-174, ''United States Supreme Court Yearbook'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]] objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word "equal" be removed because such a "qualification" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said.  Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to "place a strong emphasis upon impartiality".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous.&lt;ref name=Chen /&gt; According to law professor [[Jim Chen]], it is common for people to "suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico."&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, Jim.  "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=773025 Come Back to the Nickel and Five: Tracing the Warren Court's Pursuit of Equal Justice Under Law]", ''Washington and Lee Law Review'', Vol. 59, pp. 1305-1306 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say "equal law under justice", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Milner. ''Lying Down Together: Law, Metaphor and Theology'', p. 23 (Univ. of Wisconsin Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence==
The words "equal justice under law" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Cabraser&gt;Cabraser, Elizabeth.  "The Essentials of Democratic Mass Litigation", ''Columbia Journal of Law &amp; Social Problems'', Vol. 45, p. 499, 500 (Summer 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peccarelli, Anthony.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203153539/http://www.dcba.org/brief/marissue/2000/art10300.htm "The Meaning of Justice"], ''DuPage County Bar Association Brief'' (March 2000), via Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of ''Caldwell v. Texas'', Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]: "the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Caldwell v. Texas'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/137/692/case.html 137 U.S. 692] (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;  The last seven words are summarized by the inscription on the U.S. Supreme Court building.&lt;ref name=Cabraser /&gt;

[[File:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Chief Justice Fuller (front center) wrote for a unanimous Court in ''Caldwell''.  In this 1899 photo, Justice Harlan is seated to his right, and Justice Peckham is standing to Harlan's right.]]Later in 1891, Fuller's opinion for the Court in ''Leeper v. Texas'' again referred to "equal...justice under...law".&lt;ref name=Leeper&gt;''Leeper v. Texas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9HoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;ots=bAWQjPsX_q&amp;dq=%22borders+are+not+limited,+except+that+no+State+can+deprive+particular+%22&amp;output=html 139 U.S. 462] (1891).  Fuller's opinion in ''Leeper'' stated: "It must be regarded as settled that....by the Fourteenth Amendment the powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, except that no State can deprive particular persons, or classes of persons, of equal and impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied; and that due process is so secured by laws operating on all alike, and not subjecting the individual to the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice."&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Caldwell'', the ''Leeper'' opinion was unanimous, in contrast to the Fuller Court's major disagreements about equality issues in other cases such as ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aside from Fuller, the members of the Court in 1891 were as follows: [[Joseph P. Bradley]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], [[John Marshall Harlan]], [[Horace Gray]], [[Samuel Blatchford]], [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar]], [[David Josiah Brewer]], and [[Henry Billings Brown]].   The Fuller Court most famously disagreed about equality issues in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', 163 U.S. 537 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In both ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', murder [[indictment]]s were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged.  The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law.&lt;Ref&gt;Stuntz, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEHgwemq0nYC&amp;pg=PA124 The Collapse of American Criminal Justice]'', p. 124 (Harvard U. Press 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In a case nine years later (''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]''), the Court quoted the "equal...justice under...law" phrase that it had used in ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are "proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/176/581/case.html 176 U.S. 581] (1900); Justice Peckham wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Harlan was the sole dissenter.  Harlan argued that a person cannot be tried for an infamous crime by a jury of less than twelve persons, instead of the eight jurors allowed in Utah.  Many years later, in ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court held that six jurors are enough.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1908 case of ''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments:  "The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/208/481/case.html 208 U.S. 481] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Ughbanks''  was a [[burglary]] case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham|Rufus Peckham]], while Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] was the sole dissenter.  The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of ''[[Robinson v. California]]'').  

In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words "equal justice under law" with the Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, in the 1958 case of ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'', the Court said: "The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal."&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper v. Aaron'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/358/1/case.html 358 U.S. 1] (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Raneta and Kelly, Michael.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vsTP_KhsulsC&amp;pg=PT36 Equal Justice in the Balance: America's Legal Responses to the Emerging Terrorist Threat]'', p. 16 (U. Mich. Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The words "equal justice under law" are not in [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]], which instead says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq-pOED4TSUC&amp;pg=PT145 Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices]'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  From an architectural perspective, the main advantage of the former over the latter was brevity — the [[Equal Protection Clause]] was not short enough to fit on the [[pediment]] given the size of the letters to be used.

==Following ancient tradition==
[[Image:Pericles3.JPG|thumb|right|Pericles, Greek statesman and general]]In [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|the funeral oration]] that he delivered in 431 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] leader [[Pericles]] encouraged belief in what we now call equal justice under law.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cC06AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 Law for the Public Speaker: Legal Aspects of Public Address]'', p. 171 (Christopher Pub. House, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when  Chief Justice Fuller wrote his opinion in ''Caldwell v. Texas'', he was by no means the first to discuss this concept.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html 118 U.S. 356] (1886):  "Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several different English translations of the relevant passage in Pericles' funeral oration.  

Here is Pericles discussing "equal justice" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by Richard Crawley (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: "the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Benjamin. ''[http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk2rv2.htm Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides,]'' Second edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press (1900): "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbours, but are an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognised; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  And, the English translation by [[Rex Warner]] in 1954 had Pericles saying: "there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Pericles's Funeral Oration|Pericles's Funeral Oration]]'', translated by Rex Warner (1954), via wikisource: "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;  The funeral oration by Pericles was published in [[Thucydides]]’ ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', of which there are [[History of the Peloponnesian War#Translations|several other English translations]].  

As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives.  Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription "equal justice under law" by referring to the judicial [[oath of office]], which requires judges to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt; Decades later, Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] made a similar point: "The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law."&lt;ref&gt;''Pennzoil v. Texaco'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/1/case.html 481 U.S. 1] (1987)(Thurgood Marshall, concurring in the judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-11/news/8701270894_1_texas-courts-texaco-federal-court How To Handle A Texas-sized Lawsuit]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (April 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18692">{{History of Uganda}}In early August 1972, the [[President of Uganda]], [[Idi Amin]], ordered the expulsion of his country's [[Indians in Uganda|South Asian minority]], giving them 90 days to leave the country.&lt;ref name="BBC On This Day"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm|title=1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda|last=|first=|date=7 August 1972|work=|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|via=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent (mostly [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/international/story/19790515-hopes-soar-among-ugandan-asians-as-idi-amin-dictatorial-regime-falls-822011-2014-02-28|title=Hopes soar among Ugandan Asians as Idi Amin's dictatorial regime falls|date=February 28, 2014|first=K|last=Srinivas|publisher=[[India Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujaratis-survived-Idi-Amin-fuelled-East-Africas-economy/articleshow/3625352.cms|title=Gujaratis survived Idi Amin, fuelled East Africa’s economy|date=October 22, 2008|first1=Ashish|last1=Vashi|first2=Ankur|last2=Jain|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Although the latter were ultimately exempted from the expulsion, many chose to leave voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|pp=285–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsion took place against a backdrop of [[Anti-Indian sentiment|Indophobia]] in Uganda, with Amin accusing a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to ethnic Ugandans.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;

Many of the expellees were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 refugees ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;

== Background ==
The presence of South Asians in Uganda was the result of deliberate choices by the British administration (1894–1962).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Henckaerts|Sohn|1995|pp=22&amp;ndash;24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought to the [[Uganda Protectorate]] by the British to "serve as a buffer between Europeans and Africans in the middle rungs of commerce and administration".&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In addition, in the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|brought to Southeast Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the [[Uganda Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the [[African Great Lakes]] after the line's completion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;{{harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=12&amp;ndash;19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 50,000 were British passport holders,&lt;ref name="BBC On This Day" /&gt; though Amin himself used the apparently exaggerated figure of 80,000 British passport holders in his initial expulsion speech.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The British had invested in the education of the Asian minority, in preference to that of indigenous Ugandans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the early 1970s, many Indians in Southeast Africa and Uganda were employed in the [[sartorial]] and [[banking]] businesses{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} and [[Indophobia]] was already engrained by the start of Amin's rule in February 1971.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While not all Ugandan Asians were well off, they were on average better off than the indigenous communities,&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Indians were stereotyped as "merely traders" and labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}), who tried to cheat unsuspecting purchasers and looked out only for their own families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=19&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it was "not unusual to find that Indians possessed attitudes of superiority and negative pictures of the ability and efficiency of Africans".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Racial segregation was institutionalised.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.&lt;ref name="Journal of Modern African Studies"&gt;{{harvnb|Jamal|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Obote]]'s government had pursued a policy of "Africanisation" which included policies targeted at Ugandan Asians. The 1968 Committee on the "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry", for example, had made far-reaching Indophobic proposals and a system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of non-citizen Indians in economic and professional activities. Nevertheless, Amin's policies represented a significant acceleration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In August 1971, Amin announced a review of the citizenship status awarded to Uganda's Asian community, followed by the declaration of a [[census]] of Uganda's Asian population in October that year.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; In order to resolve the "misunderstandings" regarding the role of Uganda's Asian minority in society, he then convened an Indian 'conference' for 7–8 December. In a memorandum presented on the second day of the conference, he set out his hope that "the wide gap" between Ugandan Asians and Africans would narrow.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While paying tribute to Indians' contribution to the economy and the professions, he accused a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; On the vexed question of citizenship, he said his government would recognise citizenship rights already granted, but all outstanding applications for citizenship (which by this point were thought to number more than 12,000) would be cancelled.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

This expulsion of an ethnic minority was not the first in Uganda's history as the country's [[Kenya]]n minority, numbering approximately 30,000, had been expelled in 1969–70.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mutibwa|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The expulsion==
[[File:Idi Amin -Archives New Zealand AAWV 23583, KIRK1, 5(B), R23930288.jpg|thumb|upright|Idi Amin, pictured shortly after the expulsion]]

On 4 August 1972, Amin declared that Britain would need to take on responsibility for British subjects of Asian origin,&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; accusing them of "sabotaging Uganda's economy and encouraging corruption".&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The deadline for British subjects to leave was confirmed as three months, which came to mean 8 November. On 9 August, the policy was expanded to include citizens of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; The position of the 23,000 Asians who had been granted Ugandan citizenship (and in particular those who held no other citizenship) was less clear. Not originally included, on 19 August, they were seemingly added to the list, before being re-exempted three days later following international protest. Many chose to leave rather than endure further intimidation, with only 4,000 known to have stayed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; Exemptions for certain professions were added, then later removed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The precise motivation for the expulsion remains unclear. Some of his former supporters suggest that it followed a dream in which, he claimed, Allah had told him to expel them, as well as plot vengeance against the British government for refusing to provide him with arms to invade Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-15/india/27882308_1_devang-raval-museveni-indians | work=The Times Of India | title=Idi Amin had targeted Indians in 70s | date=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to the ethnic Ugandans:

{{quote|We are determined to make the ordinary Ugandan master of his own destiny, and above all to see that he enjoys the wealth of his country. Our deliberate policy is to transfer the economic control of Uganda into the hands of Ugandans, for the first time in our country's history.|Idi Amin|quoted in ''Uganda: a modern history''.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt;}}

Ugandan soldiers during this period engaged in theft and physical and sexual violence against the Asians with impunity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Restrictions were imposed on the sale or transfer of private businesses by Ugandan Asians and on 16 August Amin made it clear that after he was done with Indian-owned business, European-owned businesses would be next.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Amin's decrees drew immediate condemnation, including from India, who severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The Indian government warned Uganda of dire consequences, but took no action when Amin's government ignored the ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|title=Idia Amin Biography|accessdate=29 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927025444/http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom froze a £10 million loan which had been arranged the previous year; Amin simply shrugged this off.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Many of the Indians were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 refugees subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]]. [[Malawi]], [[Pakistan]], [[West Germany]] and the [[United States]] took 1,000 refugees each, with smaller numbers emigrating to [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Mauritius]] and [[New Zealand]]. About 20,000 refugees were unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="socialorigins"&gt;{{harvnb|Kasozi |Musisi|Sejjengo|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hundred remained behind.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Reluctant to expand its newly introduced immigration quota, the British government had sought agreement from its British overseas territories to resettle them; however, only the [[Falkland Islands]] responded positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/01/past.politics | title=Ministers hunted for island to house Asians | first=Alan | last=Travis | work=The Guardian | date=1 January 2003 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] similarly closed their borders with Uganda to prevent an influx of refugees.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Some of those expelled were [[Nizari Ismaili]] [[Muslims]]. The [[Aga Khan]], the Imam of Nizari Ismailis phoned his long-time friend Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Trudeau's government agreed to allow thousands of Nizari Ismailis to emigrate to Canada.&lt;ref name="macleansHolyMan"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exodus of Ugandan Asians took on a new level of urgency on the September following a telegram from Amin to the UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], in which it appeared that Amin was sympathetic to Hitler's treatment of Jews and an airlift was organised.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The UN dispatched the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|Economic Commission for Africa]], [[Robert K. A. Gardiner]], who attempted in vain to convince Amin to reverse his decision.{{sfn|Sherwood|2014|p=43}}

Before the expulsion, Asians owned many large businesses in Uganda but the purge of Asians from Uganda's economy was virtually total. In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; For political reasons, most (5,443) were reallocated to individuals, with 176 going to government bodies, 33 being reallocated to semi-state organisations and 2 going to charities. Possibly the biggest winner was the state-owned [[Uganda Development Corporation]], which gained control over some of the largest enterprises, though both the rapid nature of the growth and the sudden lack of experienced technicians and managers proved a challenge for the corporation, resulting in a restructuring of the sector in 1974–5.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; "The Ugandan economy fell deep into a crisis under the strain of civil wars, the nationalization of certain industries and the expulsion of the Asians... By 1987, President Yoweri Museveni had inherited an economy that suffered the poorest growth rate in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Samani, Vishva. Interview in the International Business Times, August 6, 2012. http://www.ibtimes.com/uganda-forty-years-after-idi-amin-expelled-asians-739228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return==
Thousands of Gujaratis returned to Uganda after [[Yoweri Museveni]], the subsequent head of state of Uganda, criticized Idi Amin's policies and invited them to return.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; According to Museveni, "Gujaratis have played a lead role in Uganda's social and industrial development. I knew that this community can do wonders for my country and they have been doing it for last many decades." The Gujaratis have resurfaced in Uganda and helped rebuild the economy of East Africa, and are financially well settled.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghRajan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

The '''fermentation theory''' was studied in depth and brought to light first by [[Louis Pasteur]]. This theory states that it is the idea or concept of how fermentation is brought on by microbes and put to the concept of spontaneous generation to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasteur|first=Louis|title=Physiological Theory of Fermentation|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1879pasteur-ferment.asp|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this theory is now outdated and has been replaced by the [[germ theory of disease]], for a long time it held true, and Louis was on the forefront of explaining why it seemed organisms appeared out of nothing instead of claiming it was just a spontaneous act of God. Fermentation was a process that has been used for thousands of years, but no one could explain exactly what was happening and why. From Pasteur's discovery of why and how fermentation occurs, the process has been studied intensely and is now a mastered art used in everyday life with processes of making things such as alcoholic beverages, some foods like yogurt or even manufacturing some medications.&lt;ref name=Viking&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiachson|first=Refr|title=Fermentation in Theory and Practice|url=http://vikingfoodguy.com/wordpress/papers/fermentation-in-theory-and-practice/|publisher=Viking Food Guy|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slonczewski|first=Joan|title=Microbiology: An Evolving Science 2nd edition|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermentation==
[[File:Gemischte Säuregärung.svg|thumb|Process of [[Fermentation]]]]
Simply put, [[fermentation]] is the anaerobic metabolic process that converts sugar into acids, gases, or alcohols. This metabolic process is used in oxygen starved environments. Yeast and many other microbes commonly use this process in order to carry our their [[anaerobic respiration]] to survive. Even the human body carries out fermentation processes from time to time. When someone runs a long distance race, lactic acid will build up in their muscles over the course of the race. That lactic acid is the by-product of fermentation taking place in their body, which tries to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] so the body can continue to run since they could not process the oxygen intake fast enough. Although fermentation will give a lower yield of ATP production than aerobic respiration does, it can occur at a much higher rate.
Fermentation has been used by humans consciously since around 5000 BCE where there were jars recovered in the Iran [[Zagros Mountains]] area in which contained remnants of a microbes similar those present in the process of making grapes into wine.
[[File:Fermentation lock.JPG|thumb|left|Example of a typical curved neck used today]]

==What the Theory is==
Before the 1870s, when Pasteur published his work on this theory, it was believed that microorganisms and even some small animals such as frogs would spontaneously appear, which was coined as [[spontaneous generation]]. Spontaneous generation was the explained theory that when elements of the Earth such as clay or mud would mix with water and sunlight in certain amounts, creatures would just appear out of that concoction. A common way that this idea was "proven" over and over again was by taking a piece of raw meat and placing it in open air, which would almost always produce maggots. This idea was accepted and believe to be true before Louis Pasteur shook the Earth with his new ideas that organisms actually came from traceable beginnings.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Pasteur demonstrated that fermentation is caused by the growth of microorganisms, and the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is due to [[biogenesis]] rather than spontaneous generation. He exposed boiled broths to air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=David|title=Louis Pasteur|url=http://enlightenmentindividuals.weebly.com/germ-theory-of-fermentation.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, when the vessels were open to the air surrounding it, the organisms appeared. It could be concluded that spontaneous generation could be disproven. The organisms did not just appear but were coming from the air, yet we were not able to see them at such a small level. His famous experiment was used with a curved neck placed on top of a beaker. This curved neck was the key to proving his findings because it showed that the germs and microbes had to fall into the broth inside. The curved neck did not allow this to happen.

The '''fermentation theory''' of [[disease]] is the (now obsolete) concept that many diseases, including the diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious", owe their origin to the presence of a "morbific principle" in the system, acting in a manner analogous to, although not identical with, the process of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. It was rendered obsolete by the [[germ theory of disease]], which led to the new science of [[bacteriology]].

==Application==
Fermenting a broth in a beaker has become more than just a way to prove that organisms don't just appear out of thin air. Today, the process of fermentation is used for a multitude of everyday applications. Some of those processes include medications which we ingest, beverages we consume, and even food we eat. Currently, companies like [[Genencor]] International uses the production of enzymes involved in fermentation to build a revenue of over $400 million a year.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Many medications such as antibiotics are produced by the fermentation process. An example is the important drug [[cortisone]], which can be prepared by the fermentation of a plant steroid known as [[diosgenin]]. [[File:Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre - geograph.org.uk - 476438.jpg|thumb|Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre]]
The enzymes used in the reaction are provided by the mold [[Rhizopus nigricans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermentation Uses|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2677/Fermentation-Uses.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as it is commonly known, alcohol of all types and brands are also produced by way of fermentation and [[distillation]]. [[Moonshine]] is a classic example of how this is carried out. Finally, foods such as yogurt are made by fermentation processes as well. Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains the characteristic bacterial cultures [[Lactobacillus bulgaricus]] and Streptococcus thermopiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milk Facts|url=http://www.milkfacts.info/Milk%20Processing/Yogurt%20Production.htm|work=Yogurt Production|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[petroleum]] exploration and development, '''formation evaluation''' is used to determine the ability of a borehole to produce [[petroleum]].  Essentially, it is the process of "recognizing a commercial well when you drill one".

Modern rotary drilling usually uses a heavy mud as a lubricant and as a means of producing a confining pressure against the formation face in the borehole, preventing blowouts.  Only in rare and catastrophic cases, do oil and gas wells ''come in'' with a fountain of gushing oil.  In real life, that is a ''[[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]''&amp;mdash;and usually also a financial and environmental disaster.  But controlling blowouts has drawbacks&amp;mdash;mud filtrate soaks into the formation around the borehole and a mud cake plasters the sides of the hole.  These factors obscure the possible presence of oil or gas in even very porous formations. Further complicating the problem is the widespread occurrence of small amounts of petroleum in the rocks of many [[sedimentary]] provinces.  In fact, if a sedimentary province is absolutely barren of traces of petroleum, it is not feasible to continue drilling there.

The formation evaluation problem is a matter of answering two questions:
#What are the lower limits for porosity, permeability and upper limits for water saturation that permit profitable production from a particular formation or pay zone; in a particular geographic area; in a particular economic climate.
#Do any of the formations in the well under consideration exceed these lower limits.

It is complicated by the impossibility of directly examining the formation. It is, in short, the problem of looking at the formation ''indirectly''.

==Formation evaluation tools==

{{further|Well logging}}
Tools to detect oil and gas have been evolving for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is [[well cuttings]] examination.  Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic [[microscope]] to determine the [[lithology]] of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining.  A portable [[ultraviolet]] light chamber or "Spook Box" is used to examine the cuttings for [[fluorescence]].  Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals.  They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish.  The solvent is usually [[carbon tetrachlorethane]].  Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates.  The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.

Well cuttings examination is a learned skill.  During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) across, are cut from the bottom of the hole by the bit.  Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole.  During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction.  They then are screened out of the mudstream by the [[shale shaker]] and fall on a pile at its base.  Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or [[mudlogger]] as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material.  Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a "bit trip" when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit.  At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.

===Coring===

One way to get more detailed samples of a formation is by coring.  Two techniques commonly used at present.  The first is the "whole core", a cylinder of rock, usually about 3" to 4" in diameter and up to {{convert|50|ft|m}} to {{convert|60|ft|m}} long.  It is cut with a "core barrel", a hollow pipe tipped with a ring-shaped diamond chip-studded bit that can cut a plug and bring it to the surface.  Often the plug breaks while drilling, usually in shales or fractures and the core barrel jams, slowly grinding the rocks in front of it to powder.  This signals the driller to give up on getting a full length core and to pull up the pipe.

Taking a full core is an expensive operation that usually stops or slows drilling for at least the better part of a day.  A full core can be invaluable for later reservoir evaluation.  Once a section of well has been drilled, there is, of course, no way to core it without drilling another well.

Another, cheaper, technique for obtaining samples of the formation is "[[Sidewall Coring]]".  One type of sidewall cores is percussion cores.  In this method, a steel cylinder&amp;mdash;a coring gun&amp;mdash;has hollow-point steel bullets mounted along its sides and moored to the gun by short steel cables.  The coring gun is lowered to the bottom of the interval of interest and the bullets are fired individually as the gun is pulled up the hole.  The mooring cables ideally pull the hollow bullets and the enclosed plug of formation loose and the gun carries them to the surface.  Advantages of this technique are low cost and the ability to sample the formation after it has been drilled.  Disadvantages are possible non-recovery because of lost or misfired bullets and a slight uncertainty about the sample depth.  Sidewall cores are often shot "on the run" without stopping at each core point because of the danger of differential sticking.  Most service company personnel are skilled enough to minimize this problem, but it can be significant if depth accuracy is important.

A second method of sidewall coring is rotary sidewall cores.  In this method, a circular-saw assembly is lowered to the zone of interest on a wireline, and the core is sawed out.  Dozens of cores may be taken this way in one run.  This method is roughly 20 times as expensive as percussion cores, but yields a much better sample.

A serious problem with cores is the change they undergo as they are brought to the surface.  It might seem that cuttings and cores are very direct samples but the problem is whether the formation at depth will produce oil or gas.  Sidewall cores are deformed and compacted and fractured by the bullet impact.  Most full cores from any significant depth expand and fracture as they are brought to the surface and removed from the core barrel.  Both types of core can be invaded or even flushed by mud, making the evaluation of formation fluids difficult.  The formation analyst has to remember that all tools give indirect data.

===Mud logging===

Mud logging (or Wellsite Geology) is a [[well logging]] process in which [[drilling mud]] and drill bit cuttings from the formation are evaluated during drilling and their properties recorded on a strip chart as a visual analytical tool and stratigraphic cross sectional representation of the well. The [[drilling mud]] which is analyzed for [[hydrocarbon]] gases, by use of a [[gas chromatograph]], contains drill bit cuttings which are visually evaluated by a mudlogger and then described in the mud log.  The total gas, chromatograph record, lithological sample, pore pressure, shale density,D-exponent, etc. (all lagged parameters because they are circulated up to the surface from the bit) are plotted along with surface parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), Weight On Bit (WOB),rotation per minute etc. on the mudlog which serve as a tool for the [[mudlogger]], drilling engineers, [[mud engineer]]s, and other service personnel charged with drilling and producing the well.

===Wireline logging===

The oil and gas industry uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's rock properties. Wireline logging can be defined as being "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." Note that "wireline logging" and "mud logging" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to "TAH" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a "well log" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.[1]

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. "Open hole logs" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. "Cased hole logs" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.[2]

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===Electric logs===
In 1928, the [[Schlumberger brothers]] in France developed the workhorse of all formation evaluation tools: the electric log.  Electric logs have been improved to a high degree of precision and sophistication since that time, but the basic principle has not changed.  Most underground formations contain water, often salt water, in their [[porosity|pore]]s.  The resistance to electric current of the total formation&amp;mdash;rock and fluids&amp;mdash;around the borehole is proportional to the sum of the volumetric proportions of mineral grains and conductive water-filled pore space.  If the pores are partially filled with gas or oil, which are resistant to the passage of electric current, the bulk formation resistance is higher than for water filled pores.  For the sake of a convenient comparison from measurement to measurement, the electrical logging tools measure the resistance of a cubic meter of formation.  This measurement is called ''resistivity''.

Modern [[resistivity logging]] tools fall into two categories, Laterolog and Induction, with various commercial names, depending on the company providing the logging services.

Laterolog tools send an electric current from an electrode on the sonde directly into the formation.  The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself.  Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid.  Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode in order to maintain a constant current intensity.  This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation.  Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid.  Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud.
   
Induction logs use an electric coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction.  This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers.  The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde.  The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation.  Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution).  Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of {{convert|40|in|mm}}.  Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools.  These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils.  Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils.  Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity.  Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid.   In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.

Until the late 1950s electric logs, mud logs and sample logs comprised most of the oilman's armamentarium.  Logging tools to measure porosity and permeability began to be used at that time.  The first was the microlog.  This was a miniature electric log with two sets of electrodes.  One measured the formation resistivity about 1/2" deep and the other about 1"-2" deep.  The purpose of this seemingly pointless measurement was to detect permeability.  Permeable sections of a borehole wall develop a thick layer of mudcake during drilling.  Mud liquids, called filtrate, soak into the formation, leaving the mud solids behind to -ideally- seal the wall and stop the filtrate "invasion" or soaking.  The short depth electrode of the microlog sees mudcake in permeable sections.  The deeper 1" electrode sees filtrate invaded formation.  In nonpermeable sections both tools read alike and the traces fall on top of each other on the stripchart log.  In permeable sections they separate.

Also in the late 1950s porosity measuring logs were being developed.  The two main types are: nuclear porosity logs and sonic logs.

===Porosity logs===
The two main nuclear porosity logs are the Density and the Neutron log.

Density logging tools contain a [[caesium-137]] [[gamma ray]] source which irradiates the formation with 662&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] gamma rays. These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation through [[Compton scattering]] and lose energy. Once the energy of the gamma ray has fallen below 100&amp;nbsp;keV, photolectric absorption dominates: gamma rays are eventually absorbed by the formation. The amount of energy loss by Compton scattering is related to the number electrons per unit volume of formation. Since for most elements of interest (below Z = 20) the ratio of atomic weight, A, to atomic number, Z, is close to 2, gamma ray energy loss is related to the amount of matter per unit volume, i.e., formation density.

A gamma ray detector located some distance from the source, detects surviving gamma rays and sorts them into several energy windows. The number of high-energy gamma rays is controlled by compton scattering, hence by formation density. The number of low-energy gamma rays is controlled by photoelectric absorption, which is directly related to the average atomic number, Z, of the formation, hence to [[lithology]]. Modern density logging tools include two or three detectors, which allow compensation for some borehole effects, in particular for the presence of mud cake between the tool and the formation.

Since there is a large contrast between the density of the minerals in the formation and the density of pore fluids, porosity can easily be derived from measured formation bulk density if both mineral and fluid densities are known.

Neutron porosity logging tools contain an [[americium]]-[[beryllium]] [[neutron]] source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation.  Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly away from the source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons.  A detector at some distance from the source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.

The combination of neutron and density logs takes advantage of the fact that lithology has opposite effects on these two porosity measurements.  The average of neutron and density porosity values is usually close to the true porosity, regardless of lithology.  Another advantage of this combination is the "gas effect."  Gas, being less dense than liquids, translates into a density-derived porosity that is too high.  Gas, on the other hand, has much less hydrogen per unit volume than liquids: neutron-derived porosity, which is based on the amount of hydrogen, is too low.  If both logs are displayed on compatible scales, they overlay each other in liquid-filled clean formations and are widely separated in gas-filled formations.

Sonic logs use a pinger and microphone arrangement to measure the velocity of sound in the formation from one end of the sonde to the other.  For a given type of rock, acoustic velocity varies indirectly with porosity. If the velocity of sound through solid rock is taken as a measurement of 0% porosity, a slower velocity is an indication of a higher porosity that is usually filled with formation water with a slower sonic velocity.

Both sonic and density-neutron logs give porosity as their primary information.  Sonic logs read farther away from the borehole so they are more useful where sections of the borehole are caved.  Because they read deeper, they also tend to average more formation than the density-neutron logs do.  Modern sonic configurations with pingers and microphones at both ends of the log, combined with computer analysis, minimize the averaging somewhat.  Averaging is an advantage when the formation is being evaluated for seismic parameters, a different area of formation evaluation.  A special log, the Long Spaced Sonic, is sometimes used for this purpose.  Seismic signals (a single undulation of a sound wave in the earth) average together tens to hundreds of feet of formation, so an averaged sonic log is more directly comparable to a seismic waveform.

Density-neutron logs read the formation within about four to seven inches (178&amp;nbsp;mm)  of the borehole wall.  This is an advantage in resolving thin beds.  It is a disadvantage when the hole is badly caved.  Corrections can be made automatically if the cave is no more than a few inches deep.  A caliper arm on the sonde measures the profile of the borehole and a correction is calculated and incorporated in the porosity reading.  However, if the cave is much more than four inches deep, the density-neutron log is reading little more than drilling mud.

===Lithology logs - SP and gamma ray===
There are two other tools, the SP log and the Gamma Ray log, one or both of which are almost always used in wireline logging.  Their output is usually presented along with the electric and porosity logs described above.  They are indispensable as additional guides to the nature of the rock around the borehole.

The SP log, known variously as a "Spontaneous Potential", "Self Potential" or "Shale Potential" log is a voltmeter measurement of the voltage or electrical potential difference between the mud in the hole at a particular depth and a copper ground stake driven into the surface of the earth a short distance from the borehole.  A salinity difference between the drilling mud and the formation water acts as a natural battery and will cause several voltage effects.  This "battery" causes a movement of charged ions between the hole and the formation water where there is enough permeability in the rock.  The most important voltage is set up as a permeable formation permits ion movement, reducing the voltage between the formation water and the mud.  Sections of the borehole where this occurs then have a voltage difference with other nonpermeable sections where ion movement is restricted.  Vertical ion movement in the mud column occurs much more slowly because the mud is not circulating while the drill pipe is out of the hole.  The copper surface stake provides a reference point against which the SP voltage is measured for each part of the borehole.  There can also be several other minor voltages, due for example to mud filtrate streaming into the formation under the effect of an overbalanced mud system.  This flow carries ions and is a voltage generating current.  These other voltages are secondary in importance  to the voltage resulting from the salinity contrast between mud and formation water.

The nuances of the SP log are still being researched.  In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water.  Some pores are completely filled with water.  Others have a thin layer of water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or oil filling the rest of the pore.  In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation.  If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby.  Shales do not allow water or ion movement.  Although they may have a large water content, it is bound to the surface of the flat clay crystals comprising the shale.  Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock.  As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections.  The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology.  SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column.  It also can suffer from stray voltages caused by other logging tools that are run with it.  Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason.  With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.

The gamma ray log is a measurement of naturally occurring gamma radiation from the borehole walls.  Sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz and limestones are nonradioactive calcite.  Shales however, are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium.  Thus the presence or absence of gamma rays in a borehole is an indication of the amount of shale or clay in the surrounding formation.  The gamma ray log is useful in holes drilled with air or with oil based muds, as these wells have no SP voltage.  Even in water-based muds, the gamma ray and SP logs are often run together.  They comprise a check on each other and can indicate unusual shale sections which may either not be radioactive, or may have an abnormal ionic chemistry.  The gamma ray log is also useful to detect coal beds, which, depending on the local geology, can have either low radiation levels, or high radiation levels due to adsorption of uranium.  In addition, the gamma ray log will work inside a steel casing, making it essential when a cased well must be evaluated.

==Interpreting the tools==

The immediate questions that have to be answered in deciding to complete a well or to plug and abandon (P&amp;A) it are:
*Do any zones in the well contain producible hydrocarbons?
*How much?
*How much, if any, water will be produced with them?

The elementary approach to answering these questions uses the [[Archie's law|Archie Equation]].

The expedition was undertaken in retaliation for the [[Rover incident]], in which the ''Rover'', an American [[barque|bark]], had been wrecked and its crew massacred by aboriginal [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] warriors in March 1867. A [[United States Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marine]] [[company (military unit)|company]] landed in southern Formosa and attempted to advance into the native village. The natives deployed a significant amount of [[guerrilla warfare]], which they ambushed, skirmished, disengaged and retreated repeatedly.

==Background==
{{main|Rover incident}}
[[File:USS Hartford painting.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An 1864 painting of {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}}.]]
On 12 March 1867, the United States [[cargo ship|merchantman]] ''Rover'' was sailing off [[Oluanpi]], [[Formosa]] when she wrecked on an uncharted reef and began drifting out to sea. Her crew of over two dozen safely made it ashore but were attacked and killed by the Paiwanans. The [[Royal Navy]] ship {{HMS|Cormorant||6}} reached the "Koalut country" on March 26,{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=115}} discovered the fate of the ''Rover'' and informed the American [[East India Squadron|East India Station]]. Squadron commander [[Rear Admiral]] [[Henry H. Bell]] ordered [[Commander]] [[John Carson Febiger|John C. Febiger]] in the newly commissioned [[gunboat]] {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}} to proceed from [[Foochow]] to the island for an investigation of the incident.

Upon arrival [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] authorities assured Commander Febiger that the attack was carried out by warriors of a village that did not practice respect of the nation's laws. With this information, ''Ashuelot'' returned and notified Rear Admiral Bell. The American consul to Amoy, [[Charles William Le Gendre|C. W. Le Gendre]], had spent the month of April trying to establish communication with the tribes but the Koaluts remained hostile.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}}

At this point, diplomatic pressure proved a failure. After a delay of three months and "a good deal of red tapeism in Washington", a punitive expedition was decided on.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}} Bell, with the [[screw sloop|screw]] [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Wyoming|1859|2}} and his [[flagship]] {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}} left [[Shanghai]] in June for southern Formosa.

==Expedition==
The passing from Shanghai to Formosa was uneventful, the two Americans warships arriving off the southeastern coast on 13 June 1867. The sloops anchored a half-mile off the shore and made preparations for landing. A total of 181 officers, sailors and marines were landed by boat. They were commanded by Commander [[George Belknap|George E. Belknap]] of ''Hartford'' and seconded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]]. When on land the company was broken up into two forces, one commanded by Belknap and the other by Mackenzie. Captain [[James Forney]] directed the marines, twenty of whom were deployed as skirmishers in the front of the columns. Their objective was to defeat the aboriginals decisively and to capture their village. Formosa is a [[tropical]] island, very hot and humid in the summer, with mountainous jungle on the east and plains in the west. This made the march through the jungle difficult for the Americans who wore heavy uniforms designed for keeping men warm at sea.
[[File:Henry H Bell.jpg|righ|150px|thumb|''Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell'']]

After marching for nearly an hour, the Formosans attacked with [[musket]]s from concealed positions on top of a hill directly in front of the American columns. Though difficult to see, the U.S. expedition later reported that the Formosan warriors wore colorful [[face paint]] and were armed with spears and some firearms. Lieutenant MacKenzie's force engaged first by immediately charging the Formosan ambush but the natives fled before the Americans had time to climb the hill. The expedition continued further and was ambushed again so once more the Americans charged and captured the position but without inflicting losses on the enemy. As the expedition continued on to the village, the Formosans ambushed the Americans several times but did not actually hit them.

It was not until the last action that the first and only American casualty was sustained: the warriors fired a volley and a musket ball hit Lieutenant Mackenzie, mortally wounding him. After the volley the Formosans retreated again but the Americans chose not to pursue. By this time, after six hours of marching, several men had either grown delirious or passed out from the heat so the expedition returned to the ship.

==Aftermath==
When they arrived back at shore, the sailors and marines boarded their ships and then sailed back to China having failed to complete their objectives. Formosan casualties were minimal if any; no bodies were found by the Americans.

Admiral Bell and other American officers stated in their reports that the only way to make the region safe would be to drive out the natives and put the area under control of a powerful ally.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}} American diplomat [[Charles Le Gendre|C.W. Le Gendre]] persuaded [[Governor General]] Liu of Foochow to send his own expedition to Formosa. He also requested that Rear Admiral Bell send a gunboat in support of the operation but this was denied. Le Gendre took command of the Chinese troops and left Foochow for southern Formosa on 25 July 1867. In September, Le Gendre arrived at Taiwanfu (the capital city, modern-day [[Tainan]]) to announce the object of his visit and take delivery of the Amoy viceroy's promises of assistance. According to his report,{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=117-122|ps=: reproduction of Le Gendre's report}} Le Gendre marched to the tribal capital and negotiated a treaty ([[:zh:南岬之盟|南岬之盟]]) with Chief [[Tauketok]] (also Tokitok; [[:zh:卓杞篤|卓杞篤]]) to assure the safe conduct of shipwrecked sailors throughout the Paiwan chiefdom.

Attacks on wrecked merchant ships by Formosan natives did however continue. The [[Mudan Incident of 1871]], where 54 shipwrecked [[Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyūan]] sailors were captured and beheaded at the southeastern tip of Formosa, resulted in the [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874]] in which the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military campaigned against the Paiwanans. The Japanese succeeded in engaging the Paiwanan warriors in battle and received compensation from the Qing government for the massacre. From late 1867-early 1868, Bell was appointed commander of the new [[Asiatic Squadron]] and while supporting the [[Opening of Japan]], he anchored off [[Osaka]] to increase pressure on the Japanese government to open [[Hyogo]] on 1 January 1868 as previously scheduled. On 11 January, in attempts to force the Japanese at [[Kobe]] to comply with American merchant trade, rear-Admiral Bell was killed along with all but three of the men after their vessel was overturned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4323">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fréchet filter''', also called the '''cofinite filter''', on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a special subset of the set's [[power set]]. A member of this power set is in the Fréchet filter if and only if its [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] in the power set is finite. This is of interest in [[topology]], where filters originated, and relates to [[Order theory|order]] and  [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] because a set's power set is a [[partially ordered set]] (and more specifically, a lattice) under [[Subset|set inclusion]].

The Fréchet filter is named after the French mathematician [[Maurice Fréchet]] (1878-1973), who worked in topology. It is alternatively called a ''cofinite filter'' because its members are exactly the cofinite sets in a power set.

== Definition ==
The Fréchet filter ''F'' on ''X'' is the set of all subsets ''A'' of ''X'' such that the complement of ''A'' in ''X'' is finite. That is, 

::{{math|big=1|''F'' {{=}} {''A'' &amp;sube; ''X'' : ''X'' &amp;minus; ''A'' is finite}.}}

This makes ''F'' a [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]] on the lattice ('''P'''(''X''), &amp;sube;), the power set of ''X'' with set inclusion, since
# Intersection condition: if two sets are finitely complemented in ''X'', then so is their intersection (since {{math|(''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;cup; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the complement of a set ''S'', and 
# Upper-set condition: if a set is finitely complemented in ''X'', then so are its supersets in ''X''.

== Properties ==

If the base set ''X'' is finite, then ''F'' = '''P'''(''X'') since every subset of ''X'', and in particular every complement, is then finite. This case is sometimes excluded by definition or else called the '''improper filter''' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Wilfrid. ''Model Theory''. Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 265. {{ISBN|978-0-521-06636-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing ''X'' to be finite creates a single exception to the Fréchet filter's being [[Filter (mathematics)#Examples|free]] and [[Filter (mathematics)#General definition|non-principal]] since a filter on a finite set cannot be free and a non-principal filter cannot contain any singletons as members.

If ''X'' is infinite, then every member of ''F'' is infinite since it is simply ''X'' minus finitely many of its members. Additionally, ''F'' is infinite since one of its subsets is the set of all {''x''}&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is both free and non-principal, excepting the finite case mentioned above, and is included in every free filter. It is also the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] filter of the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal]] of all finite subsets of (infinite) ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is ''not'' necessarily an [[ultrafilter]] (or maximal proper filter). Consider '''P'''('''N'''). The set of even numbers is the complement of the set of odd numbers. Since neither of these sets is finite, neither set is in the Fréchet filter on '''N'''. However, an ultrafilter is free if and only if it includes the Fréchet filter. The existence of free ultrafilters was established by Tarski in 1930, relying on a theorem equivalent to the axiom of choice and is used in the construction of the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] in [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, J. Sousa and Hoskins, R. F. ''Infinitesimal methods for mathematical analysis''. Mathematics and Applications Series. Horwood Publishing, 2004, p. 53. {{ISBN|978-1-898563-99-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
On the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, the set ''B'' = { (''n'',∞) : ''n'' &amp;isin; '''N'''} is a Fréchet [[filter base]], i.e., the Fréchet filter on '''N''' consists of all supersets of elements of ''B''.

After years of work and experience, Genco Gülan's exxhibition 'Untitled' was considered as a résumé of his adventure in conceptual colors of contemporary art. The gallery space  (EKAV Foundation, Istanbul) was used in a manner that allowed all artworks "to talk" with each other apart from their unique placement, preventing monotony. Different mediums were being used with a variety of measurements, colors and display styles. Axles, like arteries, feeding the ease of legibility around which the exhibition revolves. Therefore the focal point of "Untitled" is the concept of meaning. Each artwork has its meaning however, even though they belong to different series or they were made in different mediums, create a bigger and much intense chunk of information. The exhibition holding layers of information, ready to be interpreted by the viewer, divided into all works was brought into light in 21 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/announce/events/208460/ RHIZOME: Untitled, Genco Gulan].

==Works==
"The Android Statue" of Genco Gülan was exhibited in Antalya Archeology Museum 12–20 March 2014. In the exhibition, also the sketches of his kinetic marble statue series, called "Robotic Statues" were presented. Genco Gülan gives references to archeology; he even produces new media artworks. His art try to predict the future of both sculpture as a discipline and humanity in general. Gülan has been working on robots in the labs of different universities since the middle of 1990's. He uses hardware and software of robots in many art projects. For example The artwork titled Robots, Football and War (RFW) of Gülan that consists physical robots, was part of a computer game "Balkan Wars" that won a prize from European Media Art Festival, [[Osnabrück]] in 1995. His play written by artificial intelligence (AI) robots was used in the project YEN! (New), presented in Pera Museum, for 16th Istanbul Theatre Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/announce/events/60358/ RHIZOME: The Android Statue, Genco Gulan].

Gülan's site-specific installation, 'The Great Conjugation', was exhibited at [[Boğaziçi University]]'s Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences building, Washburn Hall through May and June 2014. After 23 years, the artist returned to the building where he completed his undergraduate studies. This time he tied the twin towers of the historical building together from inside.The project which changes and transforms depending upon the location was not displayed in a museum but this time in an academic institution. Gülan's The Great Conjugation' used approximately 1000 ties for this installation. All of the connected ties created a route tens of meters long and the line flowed through the all five floors of the building. The ties connected the twin towers of the building from the inside which was built in 1906. During the exhibition Gülan invited the viewers to bring their ties and add them to the installation to generate a second level of participation. Gülan's work of art is not descriptive, it does not involve just one explanation. Both the objects that are used and the space-time relationship between them give a range of meaning to the piece. What Gülan tries to do is to constitute new semantic connections and summon new connotations by using the association of ideas. While he is doing that he claims the role of 'playmaker' and tries to be almost out of the picture. Even if the method is referring to [[Nicolas Bourriaud]]'s concept of relational aesthetics, the soft sculpture that came to life is more plastic and political among its contemporaries. The ties used in the project have different colors, designs, brands and they were made in different countries. They were gathered from hundreds of domestic and abroad donators. The ties some of which are silk, nylon and wool conjugate and become a whole. The same ties were exhibited and greatly appreciated by viewers in [[State Museum of Contemporary Art|The Thessaloniki State Museum]] of Contemporary Art and  Ankara Contemporary Art Center in 2013. At the first display in Istanbul, they were attached with a crane to a skyscraper and raised 160 meters from the ground. Genco Gülan was selected as a finalist at [[Sovereign Art Foundation|Sovereign Art Foundation European Art Prize]] in 2011. He had opened his first exhibition at White Saloon inside the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences building where he had also taken lots of courses while he was studying at the Department of Political Science and International Relations between 1987 and 1991. 'The Great Conjugation' project happened with the contributions of Ayşe Gül Toker and the Faculty Secretary Hatıra Şenkon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/announce/events/60598/ RHIZOME: The Great Conjugation, Genco Gulan].

A solo show named Swimming Rocks which was on exhibit on 27 June 2014 at the Art Gallery of Kırmızı Ardıç Kuşu, Gallery Metazori in Çeşme, Alaçatı where Gülan spent most of his childhood is not only the name of the exhibition, but also one of the significant artworks in the exhibition, the Swimming Rocks are [[pumice]] typed rocks that can float on the sea and be found in [[Aegean Sea]], especially in [[Çeşme]] and [[Alaçatı]] inspiring the artist in this process. Gülan made a sculpture, named Swimming Rocks from these and other stones; therefore this and some other sculptural pieces float on the sea and in the gallery. He made floating figurative, human-sized sculptures covered with stone. The artworks of Genco Gülan's mother, Tezer Gülan and his grandmother, Saime İzmiroğlu where also exhibited in the show. Genco Gülan had also a series called as "New Landscape" in this exhibition. This series being a conceptual/electronic interpretation of landscapes as barcodes dealing with questions, such as how the landscape pictures change in time, how different our landscapes became now and how the landscapes in the future will become. Gülan juxtaposed classical landscape paintings, barcodes and produced new pieces. Gülan also exhibited his new series; Digital Ghost in the show. The artist painted on large canvases; the non-existing images that appeared in his formatted laptop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alacatikirmiziardic.com/index.php/genco-gulan ALAÇATI KIRMIZI ARDIÇ GALERİ].

"At first the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum developed as an art series in the manner of [[Duchamp]] and Broodthaers until the end of the 1990s. Later it evolved when it was transferred to the Internet. It turned into a new age institution that organized exhibitions, workshops and provided logistic support on cyber space."&lt;ref&gt;Graf, Marcus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">In [[population biology]] and [[demography]], the '''generation time''' is the average time between two consecutive generations in the lineages of a [[population]]. In human populations, the generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years.&lt;ref name="OECD2015" /&gt; [[Historian]]s sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.

== Definitions and corresponding formulas ==

The existing definitions of the generation time fall into two categories: those that treat the generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;

=== The time it takes for the population to grow by a factor of its net reproductive rate ===

The [[net reproduction rate|net reproductive rate]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in [[microbiology]] ("the time it takes for the population to double", or [[doubling time]]) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a [[bacterium]] is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate ''r'' (i.e. ''n''(''t'') ~ α.e&lt;sup&gt;''rt''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n''(''t'') is the size of the population at time ''t''), then this measure of the generation time is 
given by:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\log R_0}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; is such that ''n''(''t'' + ''T'') = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''(''t''), i.e. e&lt;sup&gt;''rT''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== The average difference in age between parent and offspring ===

This definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the "average age of mothers at birth of their daughters"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age-structured population models, an expression is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \int_0^{\infty} x e^{-rx} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is the growth rate of the population, ''ℓ''(''x'') is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age ''x'') and ''m''(''x'') the maternity function (or birth function, or age-specific fertility). For [[matrix population models]], there is a general formula:&lt;ref name="BienvenuLegendre2015" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ \lambda \mathbf{v w}}{\mathbf{v F w}} = \frac{1}{\sum e_{\lambda}(f_{ij})}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''λ'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, '''F''' = (''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'') is its fertility matrix, '''v''' its reproductive value (row-vector) and '''w''' its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e_{\lambda}(f_{ij}) = \frac{f_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial f_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elasticity of a function|elasticities]] of ''λ'' to the fertilities.

=== The age at which members of a given cohort are expected to reproduce ===

This definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} x \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the average number of offspring it produces.

'''Hail and Farewell''' (a translation of ''ave atque vale'', last words of the poem [[Catullus 101]]) is a traditional military event whereby those coming to and departing from an organization are celebrated. This may coincide with a change in command, be scheduled on an annual basis, or be prompted by any momentous organizational change. It is a time to honor those who have departed the unit and thank them for their service. At the same time it is a welcome to those who are joining and introduces them to the special history and traditions of their new organization. This celebration builds organizational camaraderie and [[esprit de corps]]. It supports a sense of continuity through change.

==United States==
For the [[United States Army]], a Hail and Farewell is most often celebrated at a formal [[dining in]] when there is a change in command. This provides the unit with a formal setting in which to welcome the new commander and honor the old commander. Some units may elect a less formal [[Dining Out]] in which family member and other non-military guests are encouraged to take place in the unit change. There are no official requirements outlined by the United States Army to have a Hail and Farewell celebration. It is up to each unit to carry out this tradition as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

The [[United States Navy]], on the other hand, has specified that by custom the ship's officers must give a formal dinner when their new captain arrives. There may also be a formal dinner for the departing captain and these may be combined into one formal Hail and Farewell dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

Later interpretations such as that done by Landsberger suggested that the novelty of being research subjects and the increased attention from such could lead to temporary increases in workers' productivity. This interpretation was dubbed "the Hawthorne effect".

== History ==
[[File:Hawthorne, Illinois Works of the Western Electric Company, 1925.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Hawthorne Works, ca. 1925]] 
The term was coined in 1958 by Henry A. Landsberger&lt;ref name=HRev/&gt; when he was analyzing earlier experiments from 1924–32 at the [[Hawthorne Works]] (a [[Western Electric]] factory outside Chicago). The Hawthorne Works had commissioned a study to see if its workers would become more productive in higher or lower levels of light. The workers' productivity seemed to improve when changes were made, and slumped when the study ended.  It was suggested that the productivity gain occurred as a result of the [[motivation]]al effect on the workers of the interest being shown in them.

This effect was observed for minute increases in illumination. In these lighting studies, light intensity was altered to examine its effect on worker productivity. Most industrial/occupational psychology and organizational behavior textbooks refer to the illumination studies.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf The Industrial Organization Psychologist]'', Volume 41, ''What We Teach Students About the Hawthorne Studies'', Santa Clara University 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Only occasionally are the rest of the studies mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf |title=What We Teach Students About the Hawthorne Studies: A Review of Content Within a Sample of Introductory I-O and OB Textbooks |access-date=2007-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103164852/http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although illumination research of workplace lighting formed the basis of the Hawthorne effect, other changes such as maintaining clean work stations, clearing floors of obstacles, and even relocating workstations resulted in increased productivity for short periods. Thus the term is used to identify any type of short-lived increase in productivity.&lt;ref name="HRev"&gt;

&lt;!-- Interpretations and views vary. [[H. McIlvaine Parsons]] defines the Hawthorne effect as "the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do" (i.e. performance is affected – possibly unconsciously – by possible positive or negative personal consequences not considered by the experimenter).&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; [[Elton Mayo]] describes it in terms of a positive emotional effect due to the perception of a sympathetic or interested observer. Clark and Sugrue say that uncontrolled [[novelty effect]]s cause on average 30% of a [[standard deviation]] (SD) rise (i.e. 50–63% score rise), which decays to small level after eight weeks.&lt;ref name=ClarkSugrue1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark |first=Richard E. |last2=Sugrue |first2=Brenda M. |year=1991 |chapter=30.

=== Relay assembly experiments ===
In one of the studies, researchers chose two women as test subjects and asked them to choose four other workers to join the test group.  Together the women worked in a separate room over the course of five years (1927–1932) assembling telephone [[relay]]s.

Output was measured mechanically by counting how many finished relays each worker dropped down a chute. This measuring began in secret two weeks before moving the women to an experiment room and continued throughout the study. In the experiment room they had a supervisor who discussed changes with their productivity. Some of the variables were:

* Giving two 5-minute breaks (after a discussion with them on the best length of time), and then changing to two 10-minute breaks (not their preference). Productivity increased, but when they received six 5-minute rests, they disliked it and reduced output.
* Providing food during the breaks.
* Shortening the day by 30 minutes (output went up); shortening it more (output per hour went up, but overall output decreased); returning to the first condition (where output peaked).

Changing a variable usually increased productivity, even if the variable was just a change back to the original condition. However it is said that this is the natural process of the human being adapting to the environment, without knowing the objective of the experiment occurring. Researchers concluded that the workers worked harder because they thought that they were being monitored individually.

Researchers hypothesized that choosing one's own coworkers, working as a group, being treated as special (as evidenced by working in a separate room), and having a sympathetic supervisor were the real reasons for the productivity increase. One interpretation, mainly due to [[Elton Mayo]],&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;Mayo, Elton (1945) [https://archive.org/details/socialproblemsof00mayo ''Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization'']. Boston: Division of Research, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; was that "the six individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation in the experiment." (There was a second relay assembly test room study whose results were not as significant as the first experiment.)

=== Bank wiring room experiments ===
The purpose of the next study was to find out how payment incentives would affect productivity. The surprising result was that productivity actually decreased.  Workers apparently had become suspicious that their productivity may have been boosted to justify firing some of the workers later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lloyd Warner]] between 1931 and 1932 on a group of fourteen men who put together telephone switching equipment. The researchers found that although the workers were paid according to individual productivity, productivity decreased because the men were afraid that the company would lower the base rate. Detailed observation of the men revealed the existence of informal groups or "cliques" within the formal groups. These cliques developed informal rules of behavior as well as mechanisms to enforce them.  The cliques served to control group members and to manage bosses; when bosses asked questions, clique members gave the same responses,  even if they were untrue. These results show that workers were more responsive to the social force of their peer groups than to the control and incentives of management.

== Interpretation and criticism ==
[[Richard Nisbett]] has described the Hawthorne effect as "a glorified anecdote", saying that "once you have got the anecdote, you can throw away the data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kolata |first=G. |title=Scientific Myths That Are Too Good to Die |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 6, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/weekinreview/scientific-myths-that-are-too-good-to-die.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have attempted to explain the effects with various interpretations.

Adair warns of gross factual inaccuracy in most secondary publications on Hawthorne effect and that many studies failed to find it.&lt;ref name="Adair"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=J.G. |title=The Hawthorne Effect: A reconsideration of the methodological artifact |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=69 |issue=2 |year=1984 |pages=334–345 |url=http://www.psicologia.unimib.it/getFile.php/23195/Adair%20Hawthorne.pdf |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.69.2.334 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215070615/http://www.psicologia.unimib.it/getFile.php/23195/Adair%20Hawthorne.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it should be viewed as a variant of [[Martin Theodore Orne|Orne]]'s (1973) experimental [[demand effect]]. So for Adair, the issue is that an experimental effect depends on the participants' interpretation of the situation; this is why [[manipulation checks]] are important in social sciences experiments. So he thinks it is not awareness ''per se'', nor special attention ''per se'', but participants' interpretation that must be investigated in order to discover if/how the experimental conditions interact with the participants' goals.  This can affect whether participants believe something, if they act on it or do not see it as in their interest, etc.{{vague|date=August 2016}}

Possible explanations for the Hawthorne effect include the impact of feedback and motivation towards the experimenter. Receiving feedback on their performance may improve their skills when an experiment provides this feedback for the first time.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. M. |last=Parsons |year=1974 |title=What happened at Hawthorne?: New evidence suggests the Hawthorne effect resulted from operant reinforcement contingencies |journal=Science |volume=183 |issue=4128 |pages=922–932 |doi=10.1126/science.183.4128.922 |pmid=17756742  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the [[demand effect]] also suggests that people may be motivated to please the experimenter, at least if it does not conflict with any other motive.&lt;ref name="SteeleJohnson2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steele-Johnson |first=D. |year=2000 |title=Goal orientation and task demand effects on motivation, affect, and performance |journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=724–738 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.85.5.724 |first2=Russell S. |last3=Hoover |first3=Paul B. |last4=Schmidt |first4=Aaron M. |pmid=11055145 |last2=Beauregard }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be suspicious of the purpose of the experimenter.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt; Therefore, Hawthorne effect may only occur when there is usable feedback or a change in motivation.

Parsons defines the Hawthorne effect as "the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do" [i.e. learning effects, both permanent skill improvement and feedback-enabled adjustments to suit current goals]. His key argument is that in the studies where workers dropped their finished goods down chutes, the participants had access to the counters of their work rate.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt;

Mayo contended that the effect was due to the workers reacting to the sympathy and interest of the observers. He does say that this experiment is about testing overall effect, not testing factors separately. He also discusses it not really as an [[experimenter effect]] but as a management effect: how management can make workers perform differently because they feel differently. A lot to do with feeling free, not feeling supervised but more in control as a group. The experimental manipulations were important in convincing the workers to feel this way: that conditions were really different. The experiment was repeated with similar effects on [[mica]]-splitting workers.&lt;ref name=Mayo /&gt;

Clark and Sugrue in a review of [[educational research]] say that uncontrolled [[novelty effect]]s cause on average 30% of a [[standard deviation]] (SD) rise (i.e. 50%–63% score rise), which decays to small level after 8 weeks. In more detail: 50% of a SD for up to 4 weeks; 30% of SD for 5–8 weeks; and 20% of SD for &gt; 8 weeks, (which is &lt; 1% of the variance).&lt;ref name=ClarkSugrue1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark |first=Richard E. |last2=Sugrue |first2=Brenda M. |year=1991 |chapter=30. Research on instructional media, 1978-1988 |editor=G.J.Anglin |title=Instructional technology: past, present, and future |pages=327–343 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Englewood, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}}

[[Harry Braverman]] points out that the Hawthorne tests were based on industrial psychology and were investigating whether workers' performance could be predicted by pre-hire testing.  The Hawthorne study showed "that the performance of workers had little relation to ability and in fact often bore an inverse relation to test scores...".&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |last=Braverman |first=Harry |title=Labor and Monopoly Capitalism |year=1974 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |pages=144–145 |isbn=0853453403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braverman argues that the studies really showed that the workplace was not "a system of bureaucratic formal organisation on the [[Max Weber|Weberian model]], nor a system of informal group relations, as in the interpretation of Mayo and his followers but rather a system of power, of class antagonisms". This discovery was a blow to those hoping to apply the behavioral sciences to manipulate workers in the interest of management.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The economists [[Steven Levitt]] and [[John A. List]] long pursued without success a search for the base data of the original illumination experiments, before finding it in a microfilm at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4 programme ''More Or Less'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01j5xb1 The Hawthorne Effect]", broadcast 12 October 2013, presented by Tim Harford with contributions by John List&lt;/ref&gt;  Re-analysing it, they found slight evidence for the Hawthorn effect over the long-run, but in no way as drastic as suggested initially &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=List |first2=John A. |year=2011 |title=Was There Really a Hawthorne Effect at the Hawthorne Plant?

It is also possible that the illumination experiments can be explained by a longitudinal learning effect. Parsons has declined to analyse the illumination experiments, on the grounds that they have not been properly published and so he cannot get at details, whereas he had extensive personal communication with Roethlisberger and Dickson.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some postulate that, beyond just attention and observation, there may be other factors involved, such as slightly better care; slightly better [[compliance (medicine)|compliance/adherence]]; and [[selection bias]]. The latter may have several mechanisms: (1) Physicians may tend to recruit patients who seem to have better adherence potential and lesser likelihood of future [[lost to follow-up|loss to follow-up]]. (2) The inclusion/exclusion criteria of trials often exclude at least some [[comorbidity|comorbidities]]; although this is often necessary to prevent [[confounding]], it also means that trials may tend to work with healthier patient subpopulations.

== Secondary observer effect ==

Despite the observer effect as popularized in the Hawthorne experiments being perhaps falsely identified (see above discussion), the popularity and plausibility of the observer effect in theory has led researchers to postulate that this effect could take place at a second level. Thus it has been proposed that there is a secondary observer effect when researchers working with secondary data such as survey data or various indicators may impact the results of their scientific research. Rather than having an effect on the subjects (as with the primary observer effect), the researchers likely have their own idiosyncrasies that influence how they handle the data and even what data they obtain from secondary sources. For one, the researchers may choose seemingly innocuous steps in their statistical analyses that end up causing significantly different results using the same data; e.g., weighting strategies, factor analytic techniques, or choice of estimation. In addition, researchers may use software packages that have different default settings that lead to small but significant fluctuations. Finally, the data that researchers use may not be identical, even though it seems so. For example, the OECD collects and distributes various socio-economic data; however, these data change over time such that a researcher who downloads the Australian GDP data for the year 2000 may have slightly different values than a researcher who downloads the same Australian GDP 2000 data a few years later. The idea of the secondary observer effect was floated by Nate Breznau in a thus far relatively obscure paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breznau|first=Nate|date=2016-05-03|title=Secondary observer effects: idiosyncratic errors in small-N secondary data analysis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2014.1001221|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=301–318|doi=10.1080/13645579.2014.1001221|issn=1364-5579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little attention has been paid to this phenomenon, the scientific implications are very large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Yuan|last2=Sorenson|first2=Olav|last3=Waguespack|first3=David|date=2017-01-30|title=Temporal Issues in Replication: The Stability of Centrality-Based Advantage|url=https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-v4-5-107/|journal=Sociological Science|language=en-US|volume=4|pages=107–122|doi=10.15195/v4.a5|issn=2330-6696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this effect may be seen in recent studies that assign a particular problem to a number of researchers or research teams who then work independently using the same data to try and find a solution. This is a process called crowdsourcing data analysis and was used in a groundbreaking study by Silberzahn, Rafael, Eric Uhlmann, Dan Martin and Brian Nosek et al. (2015) about red cards and player race in football (i.e., soccer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/j5v8f/|title=OSF {{!}} Crowdsourcing Analytics - Final Manuscript.pdf|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2015/03/26/crowdsourcing-data-to-improve-macro-comparative-research/|title=Crowdsourcing Data to Improve Macro-Comparative Research|date=2015-03-26|newspaper=Policy and Politics Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''health action process approach''' ('''HAPA''') is a psychological theory of health behavior change, developed by Ralf Schwarzer, Professor of Psychology at the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] of [[Berlin, Germany]].

Health behavior change refers to a replacement of health-compromising behaviors (such as sedentary behavior) by health-enhancing behaviors (such as physical exercise). To describe, predict, and explain such processes, theories or models are being developed. Health [[behavioural change theories]] are designed to examine a set of psychological constructs that jointly aim at explaining what motivates people to change and how they take preventive action.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Norman, P. (Eds.). (2005). Predicting health behavior: Research and practice with [[social cognition]] models (2nd ed.). Buckingham, England: [[Open University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F. (2009). Towards a theory of intentional behaviour change: Plans, planning, and [[Self-control|self-regulation]]. British [[Journal of Health Psychology]], 14, 261–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

HAPA is an open framework of various [[motivation]]al and [[volition (psychology)|volitional]] constructs that are assumed to explain and predict individual changes in health behaviors such as quitting smoking or drinking, and improving [[physical exercise|physical activity]] levels, [[oral hygiene|dental hygiene]], seat belt use, [[breast self-examination]], dietary behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, S. J. H., &amp; Fuchs, R. (2009). Exercise psychology: A view from Europe. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 10, 410–419.&lt;/ref&gt; and avoiding drunk driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Hollie|last2=Sheehan|first2=Mary|last3=Palk|first3=Gavan|last4=Watson|first4=Angela|title=Self-efficacy, planning, and drunk driving: Applying the health action process approach.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/hea0000358|journal=Health Psychology|volume=35|issue=7|pages=695–703|doi=10.1037/hea0000358}}&lt;/ref&gt; HAPA suggests that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors should be conceived of as a structured process including a motivation phase and a volition phase. The former describes the intention formation while the latter refers to planning, and action (initiative, maintenance, recovery). The model emphasizes the particular role of perceived self-efficacy at different stages of health behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, S. (2005). Stage models of health behaviour. In M. Conner &amp; P. Norman (Eds.), Predicting health behaviour: Research and practice with social cognition models (2nd ed., pp. 223–275). Maidenhead, England: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Models that describe health behavior change can be distinguished in terms of the assumption whether they are continuum-based or stage-based.&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., &amp; Ziegelmann, J. P. (2008). Theory-based health behavior change: Developing, testing and applying theories for evidence-based interventions. Applied Psychology: International Review, 57, 698–716.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuum (mediator) model claims that change is a continuous process that leads from lack of motivation via action readiness either to successful change or final disengagement. Research on such mediator models are reflected by path diagrams that include distal and proximal predictors of the target behavior. On the other hand, the stage approach assumes that change is [[nonlinearity|non-linear]] and consists of several qualitative steps that reflect different mindsets of people. A two-layer framework that can be applied either as a continuum or as a stage model is HAPA.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer, R. 2008"&gt;Schwarzer, R. (2008). Modeling health behavior change: How to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 57(1), 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and [[risk perception]] as distal predictors, [[intention]] as a middle-level mediator, and volitional factors (such as action planning) as the most proximal predictors of behavior. ''See [[Self-efficacy]].''

Good intentions are more likely to be translated into action when people plan when, where, and how to perform the desired behavior. Intentions foster planning, which in turn facilitates behavior change. Planning was found to mediate the intention-behavior relation.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M., &amp; Sheeran, P. (2006). Implementation intentions and goal achievement: A [[meta-analysis]] of effects and processes. Advances in Experimental [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]], 38, 69–119.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction has been made between action planning and coping planning. Coping planning takes place when people imagine scenarios that hinder them to perform their intended behavior, and they develop one or more plans to cope with such a challenging situation.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, U., Schüz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., Lippke, S., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2008). Beyond behavioural intentions: Planning mediates between intentions and physical activity. British Journal of Health Psychology, 13, 479–494.&lt;/ref&gt;

HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Thus, one can superimpose these three phases (stages) on the continuum (mediator) model as a second layer, and regard the stages as moderators. This two-layer architecture allows to switch between the continuum model and the stage model, depending on the given research question.

==Five principles==
HAPA has five major principles that make it distinct from other models.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer, R. 2008"/&gt;

''Principle 1: Motivation and volition''. The first principle suggests that one should divide the health behavior change process into two phases. There is a switch of [[mindset]]s when people move from deliberation to action. First comes the motivation phase in which people develop their intentions. Afterwards, they enter the volition phase.

''Principle 2: Two volitional phases''. In the volition phase there are two groups of individuals: those who have not yet translated their intentions into action, and those who have. There are inactive as well as active persons in this phase. In other words, in the volitional phase one finds intenders as well as actors who are characterized by different psychological states. Thus, in addition to health behavior change as a continuous process, one can also create three categories of people with different mindsets depending on their current point of residence within the course of health behavior change: preintenders, intenders, and actors. The assessment of stages is done by behavior-specific stage algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., Ziegelmann, J. P., Schwarzer, R., &amp; Velicer, W. F. (2009). Validity of stage assessment in the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Health Psychology, 28, 183–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principle 3: Postintentional planning''. Intenders who are in the volitional preactional stage are motivated to change, but do not act because they might lack the right skills to translate their intention into action. Planning is a key strategy at this point. Planning serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behavior.

''Principle 4: Two kinds of mental simulation''. Planning can be divided into action planning and coping planning. Action planning pertains to the when, where, and how of intended action. Coping planning includes the anticipation of barriers and the design of alternative actions that help to attain one's goals in spite of the impediments. The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, action planning and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F., Schwarzer, R., Scholz, U., &amp; Schüz, B. (2005). Action planning and coping planning for long-term lifestyle change: Theory and assessment. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35, 565–576.&lt;/ref&gt; Action planning seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F., Scholz, U., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2006). Action plans and coping plans for physical exercise: A longitudinal intervention study in cardiac rehabilitation. British Journal of Health Psychology, 11, 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principle 5: Phase-specific self-efficacy''. Perceived self-efficacy is required throughout the entire process. However, the nature of self-efficacy differs from phase to phase. This difference relates to the fact that there are different challenges as people progress from one phase to the next one. [[Objective (goal)|Goal setting]], planning, initiation, action, and maintenance pose challenges that are not of the same nature. Therefore, one should distinguish between preactional self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Luszczynska&gt;Luszczynska, A., Mazurkiewicz, M., Ziegelmann J. P., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Recovery self-efficacy and intention as predictors of running or jogging behavior: A cross-lagged [[panel analysis]] over a two-year period. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 8, 247–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the terms task self-efficacy instead of preaction self-efficacy, and maintenance self-efficacy instead of coping and recovery self-efficacy are preferred.

==Psychological interventions==
When it comes to the design of interventions, one can consider identifying individuals who reside either at the motivational stage or the volitional stage.&lt;ref&gt;Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F. F., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Stage-specific effects of an action control intervention on dental flossing. [[Health education|Health Education]] Research, 22, 332–341.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each group becomes the target of a specific treatment that is tailored to this group. Moreover, it is theoretically meaningful and has been found useful to subdivide further the volitional group into those who perform and those who only intend to perform. In the postintentional preactional stage, individuals are labeled "intenders", whereas in the actional stage they are labeled "actors". Thus, a suitable subdivision within the health behavior change process yields three groups: nonintenders, intenders, and actors.&lt;ref&gt;Luszczynska, A., Tryburcy, M., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Improving fruit and vegetable consumption: A self-efficacy intervention compared to a combined self-efficacy and planning intervention. Health Education Research, 22, 630–638.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "stage" in this context was chosen to allude to the stage theories, but not in the strict definition that includes irreversibility and invariance. The terms "phase" or "mindset" may be equally suitable for this distinction. The basic idea is that individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change. Thus, interventions may be most efficient when tailored to these particular mindsets. For example, nonintenders are supposed to benefit from confrontation with outcome expectancies and some level of risk communication.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzer, R., Cao, D. S., &amp; Lippke, S. (2010). Stage-matched minimal interventions to enhance physical activity in Chinese adolescents. Journal of Adolescent Health, 47, 533–539. {{doi|10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.03.015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They need to learn that the new behavior (e.g., becoming physically active) has positive outcomes (e.g., [[quality of life|well-being]], [[weight loss]], fun) as opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current (sedentary) behavior (such as developing an illness or being unattractive). In contrast, intenders should not benefit from such a treatment because, after setting a goal, they have already moved beyond this mindset. Rather, they should benefit from planning to translate their intentions into action.&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, A. U., Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F.F., Scholz, U., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Disentangling the relation between intentions, planning, and behaviour: A moderated mediation analysis. Psychology &amp; Health, 24 (1), 67–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, actors do not need any treatment at all unless one wants to improve their [[relapse]] prevention skills. Then, they should be prepared for particular high-risk situations in which lapses are imminent. Preparation can be exercised by teaching them to anticipate such situations and by acquiring the necessary levels of perceived recovery self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Luszczynska/&gt;
There are quite a few randomized controlled trials that have examined the notion of stage-matched interventions based on HAPA, for example in the context of dietary behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, A. U., Lippke, S., Reuter, T., Schüz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Prediction of stage transitions in fruit and vegetable intake. Health Education Research, 24, 596–607. {{doi|10.1093/her/cym092}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  physical activity,&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., Schwarzer, R., Ziegelmann, J. P., Scholz, U., &amp; Schüz, B. (2010). Testing stage-specific effects of a stage-matched intervention: A randomized controlled trial targeting physical exercise and its predictors. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 37, 533–546. {{doi|10.1177/1090198109359386}} .&lt;/ref&gt;
and dental hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F. F., Mallach, N., Wiedemann, A., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Predicting transitions from preintentional, intentional and actional stages of change: Adherence to oral self-care recommendations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">A '''higraph''' is a diagramming object that formalizes relations into a visual structure, it was developed by [[David Harel]] in 1988. Higraphs extend [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|mathematical graphs]] by including notions of [[:wikt:depth|depth]] and [[orthogonality]]. In particular, [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]] in a higraph can contain other nodes inside them, creating a hierarchy. The idea was initially developed for applications to [[databases]], [[knowledge representation]], and the behavioral specification of complex [[concurrent systems]] using the higraph-based language of statecharts.

Higraphs are widely used in industrial applications like [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]. Recently they have been used by [[philosophers]] to formally study the use of [[diagrams]] in [[mathematical proof]]s and reasoning.

== Origins ==
The Holacracy system was developed at [[Ternary Software]], an [[Exton, Pennsylvania]] company that was noted for experimenting with more democratic forms of organizational governance.&lt;ref name="Badal07"&gt;{{cite news |last=Badal |first=Jaclyne |date=April 23, 2008 |title=Can a Company Be Run as a Democracy? |url= |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternary founder Brian Robertson distilled the company's best practices into an organizational system that became known as Holacracy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=Brian |last2= |first2= |date=June 2007 |title=Evolving Organization |url= |journal=Integral Leadership Review |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages= |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson later developed the "[http://holacracy.org/constitution Holacracy Constitution]", which lays out the core principles and practices of the system. In June 2015, he released the book ''Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World,'' that details and explains his practices.

The term holacracy is derived from the term [[holarchy]], coined by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his 1967 book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895500921|title=Holacracy : the new management system for a rapidly changing world|last=J.|first=Robertson, Brian|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781627794282|edition= First|location=New York|pages=38|oclc=895500921}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holarchy is composed of [[Holon (philosophy)|holons]] (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos "whole") or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Koestler67"&gt;{{cite book |last= Koestler|first= Arthur|year= 1967|title=The Ghost in the Machine |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts.&lt;ref name="Koestler67" /&gt;

== Influences and comparable systems ==

Holacracy is one of several systems of [[flat organization]]. It has been compared to [[sociocracy]], a system of governance developed in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="steele12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Robert David |date=June 5, 2012 |title=The Open-Source Everything Manifesto |url= |location= |publisher=North Atlantic Books | page = 47 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy had a significant early influence during the incubation of Holacracy,&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Brian Robertson on Holacracy (2006): https://web.archive.org/web/20060630101107/http://www.ternarysoftware.com/pages/downloads/BrianRobertsonInterview2006-02-08v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; though Holacracy has increasingly differentiated away from it since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org/holacracy-sociocracy/ |title=Holacracy and Sociocracy |author= |year=2010 |website=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy particularly inspired the development of the circle structure and governance processes (described in more detail later) within Holacracy. Holacracy is designed for organizations and fundamentally differentiates the roles of the organization from the people working in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holacracy.org/resources/sociocracy-holacracy |title=Sociocracy &amp; Holacracy |author= |year=2013 |website=http://holacracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its emphasis on iterative governance, adaptive processes, and self-organization, {{cnspan|text=Holacracy draws inspiration from [[agile software development]] principles and the [[lean manufacturing]] process|date=November 2015}}. Holacracy is highly compatible with [[stakeholder theory]] as its board structure allows for multiple stakeholders to be represented in the governance of an organization and for multiple organizations with shared interests to be linked at the governance level.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Essential elements ==

=== Roles instead of job descriptions ===
The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art11|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles are defined by each circle —or team— via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.

=== Circle structure ===
Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.

=== Governance process ===
Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy governance meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational process ===
Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams around operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner duties in Holacracy|url=http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Partner_Duties|work=wiki.holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Röll|first=Martin|title=Energizing Project Roles (Holacracy Basics, Part 1)|url=http://structureprocess.com/blog/energizing-roles/|work=structureprocess.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Work|title=Part 2: Permission Cultures|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/part-2-permission-cultures-738b20a8ce3c|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art14|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holacracy is thus highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental.

Holacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy tactical meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature of this last phase, known as "triage", is to focus discussions on the concrete next steps needed by the individual who added the agenda item to address his or her issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Olivier|last=Compagne|title=One Thread at a Time|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/one-thread-at-a-time-7b297718bc59|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is to avoid large, unproductive discussions dominated by the louder voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristy|last=Meade|title=Holacracy: A Step Toward Equality|url=https://medium.com/@_Kristy_/holacracy-a-step-toward-equality-447898ae4c73|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holacracy in contemporary practice ==
In the U.S., for-profit and not-for-profit organizations have adopted and practiced Holacracy. Examples include [[Zappos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last =  Groth | title = Zappos is going holacratic: no job titles, no managers, no hierarchy | url = http://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-going-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/ | work = Quartz | date = 2013-12-30 | accessdate = 2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[David Allen Company]], [[Precision Nutrition]], and nonprofit [[Conscious Capitalism (organization)|Conscious Capitalism]]. [[Medium (service)|Medium]] used Holacracy for several years before abandoning it in 2016.&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.medium.com/management-and-organization-at-medium-2228cc9d93e9#.80p0z3d3j |title=Management and Organization at Medium |last=Doyle |first=Andy |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Holacracy is claimed{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation and accountability within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Michelle |year=2012 |title=Navigating the New Work Paradigm |url= |location= |publisher=Center for Creative Emergence |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach encourages individual team members to take initiative and gives them a process in which their concerns or ideas can be addressed.&lt;ref name="Badal07" /&gt; The system of distributed authority reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision.

According to [[Zappos]]'s CEO [[Tony Hsieh]], Holacracy makes individuals more responsible for their own thoughts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hsieh | first =Tony  | title =A Memo From Tony Hsieh | work =Zappos Insights| publisher =Zappos | date =April 8, 2015 | url =http://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/item/a-memo-from-tony-hsieh | accessdate = June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Steve Denning]] warned against viewing Holacracy as a panacea, claiming that instead of removing hierarchy, decisions are funneled down from circle to circle in a clear hierarchy, with each subsequent circle knowing less about the big picture than the one above.&lt;ref name="Denning"&gt;{{cite web | first = Steve | last =  Denning | title = Making sense of Zappos and Holacracy | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/01/15/making-sense-of-zappos-and-holacracy/ | work = Forbes | date = 2014-01-15 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the rules and procedures laid out in the founding documents of Holacracy such as Robertson's originating article&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; are very detailed and focused on "administrivia."&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; Lastly, Denning added that the voice of the customer was missing from the Holacracy model, concluding that for agile and customer-focused companies such as [[Zappos]], Holacracy is a way to add administrative rigor, but that Holacracy would not necessarily work well in an organization that did not already have agility and passion for the customer.&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; HolacracyOne partner Olivier Compagne replied to those criticisms on the company's blog, claiming that Denning's criticisms misunderstand Holacracy, and explaining how the rules of Holacracy address or avoid those alleged pitfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Olivier | last =  Compagne | title = Holacracy Is Not What You Think | url = https://medium.com/holacracyone-blog/67144c3adf8 | work = HolacracyOne's Blog | date = 2014-01-21 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In moving away from Holacracy, ''Medium'' noted that "for larger initiatives, which require coordination across functions, it can be time-consuming and divisive to gain alignment" and that Medium believed that "the act of codifying responsibilities in explicit detail hindered a proactive attitude and sense of communal ownership". They also noted that the inaccurate media coverage of Holacracy created a challenge for recruitment.&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt;

At Zappos, about 14% of the company left voluntarily in 2015 in a deliberate attempt by Zappos to have only retain employees who believed in holacracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos has now lost 18% of its employees to its radical buyout offer | url = http://qz.com/590632/zappos-has-now-lost-18-of-its-employees-to-its-radical-buyout-offer/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-01-13 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include a "one-size-fits-all" approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Julia | last = Culen | title = Holacracy: not safe enough to try | url = https://pazifika.com/2016/04/03/holacracy-not-safe-enough-to-try/ | date = 2016-04-03 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; layers of bureaucracy and more psychological weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos is struggling with Holacracy because humans aren’t designed to operate like software | url = http://qz.com/849980/zappos-is-struggling-with-holacracy-because-humans-arent-designed-to-operate-like-software/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-12-21 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=January 2011}}

'''Human behavior'''  is the responses of individuals or groups of [[Human|humans]] to internal and external [[Stimulation|stimuli]]. It refers to the array of every  [[motion (physics)|physical action]] and observable [[emotion]] associated with [[individual]]s, as well as the human race. While specific traits of one's [[Personality psychology|personality]] and [[temperament]] may be more consistent, other behaviors will change as one moves from birth through adulthood. In addition to being dictated by age and [[genetics]], behavior, driven in part by [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s, is an insight into individual [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], revealing among other things [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]. [[Social behavior]], a subset of human behavior, study the considerable influence of [[social interaction]] and [[culture]]. Additional influences include [[ethics]], [[Surroundings|encircling]], [[authority]], [[rapport]], [[hypnosis]], [[persuasion]] and [[coercion]].

The behavior of humans (and other [[organism]]s or even mechanisms) falls within a range with some behavior being common, some unusual, some acceptable, and some [[Social deviance| beyond acceptable limits]]. In [[sociology]], behavior in general includes actions having no meaning, being not directed at other people, and thus all basic human actions. Behavior in this general sense should not be mistaken with [[social behavior]], which is a more advanced [[social action]], specifically directed at other people. The acceptability of behavior depends heavily upon [[Norm (sociology)|social norm]]s and is regulated by various means of [[social control]]. Human behavior is studied by the specialized [[academic discipline]]s of [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[social work]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[anthropology]].

Human behavior is experienced throughout an individual’s entire lifetime. It includes the way they act based on different factors such as genetics, social norms, core faith, and attitude. Behavior is impacted by certain traits each individual has. The traits vary from person to person  and can produce different actions or behavior from each person. Social norms also impact behavior. Due to the inherently conformist nature of human society in general, humans are [[peer pressure|pressured]] into following certain rules and displaying certain behaviors in society, which conditions the way people behave. Different behaviors are deemed to be either [[Acceptance|acceptable]] or [[unacceptable]] in different societies and cultures. Core faith can be perceived through the religion and philosophy of that individual. It shapes the way a person thinks and this in turn results in different human behaviors. Attitude can be defined as "the degree to which the person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behavior in question."&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen I, Fishbein M. (1999) Theory of reasoned action/Theory of planned behavior. University of South Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;  One's attitude is essentially a reflection of the behavior he or she will portray in specific situations. Thus, human behavior is greatly influenced by the attitudes we use on a daily basis.

==Factors==
{{essay-like|section|date=August 2018}}
===Genetics===
{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}
Long before [[Charles Darwin]] published his book ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1858, animal breeders knew that patterns of behavior are somehow influenced by inheritance from parents. Studies of identical twins as compared to less closely related human beings, and of children brought up in adoptive homes, have helped scientists understand the influence of genetics on human behavior. The study of human [[behavioral genetics]] is still developing steadily with new methods such as genome-wide association studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of behavioral genetics |last1=Anholt |first1=Robert R. H. |last2=McKay |first2=Trudy F. C. |date=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |location= |isbn=978-0-12-372575-2 |page= |pages= |laysummary=https://www.elsevier.com/books/principles-of-behavioral-genetics/anholt/978-0-12-372575-2 |laydate=16 October 2010 |ref=harv}} {{cite book|last1=Plomin |first1=Robert |last2=DeFries |first2=John C. |last3=Knopik |first3=Valerie S. |last4=Neiderhiser |first4=Jenae M. |title=Behavioral Genetics |others=Shaun Purcell (Appendix: Statistical Methods in Behaviorial Genetics) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OytMMAEACAAJ |accessdate=4 September 2013 |date=24 September 2012 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1-4292-4215-8  |laysummary=http://www.worthpublishers.com/catalog/Product/behavioralgenetics-sixthedition-plomin |laydate=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Social norms===
{{Main|Norm (social)}}
Social norms, the often-unspoken rules of a group, shape not just our behaviors but also our attitudes.
An individual’s behavior varies depending on the group(s) they are a part of, a characteristic of society that allows their norms to heavily impact society. Without social norms, human society would not function as it currently does; humans would have to be more abstract in their behavior, as there would not be a pre-tested 'normal' standardized lifestyle, and individuals would have to make many more choices for themselves. The institutionalization of norms is, however, inherent in human society perhaps as a direct result of the desire to be accepted by others, which leads humans to manipulate their own behavior in order to 'fit in' with others. Depending on their nature and upon one's perspective, norms can impact different sections of society both positively (e.g. eating, dressing warm in the winter) and negatively (e.g. racism, drug use).

===Creativity===
{{Main|Creativity}}

Creativity is assumed to be present within every individual.&lt;ref&gt;
Tanggaard, L. (2013). The sociomateriality of creativity in everyday life. (pp. 20-21). Sage

Journals. retrieved from http://cap.sagepub.com/content/19/1/20.full.pdf+html 
&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity pushes people past their comfort zone. For example, the [[Wright Brothers]]' invention of the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. The aircraft first took flight in 1903, and fifty years later the first passenger jet airliner was introduced. Creativity has kept people alive during harsh conditions, and it has also made certain individuals wealthy. We use creativity in our daily lives as well, such as finding a shortcut to a destination.

===Core faith and culture===
Another important aspect of human behavior is people's "core [[faith]]".{{cn|date=May 2018}} Such faith can manifest in  [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[culture]], and/or personal belief and often affects the way a person can behave. {{As of | 2012}}, some 80% of the United States public identified with a religion,&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pewforum.org/Unaffiliated/nones-on-the-rise.aspx |title= 'Nones' on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation |date= October 9, 2012 |publisher= [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]] |accessdate= December 20, 2012 | quote = One-fifth of the U.S. public – and a third of adults under 30 – are religiously unaffiliated today, the highest percentages ever in Pew Research Center polling.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and religion can play a large role in society. It is only natural for something that plays a large role in society to have an effect on human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Spilka, B., &amp; McIntosh, D. N. (1996). ''The psychology of religion''. [[Westview Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morals]] are another factor of core faith{{cn|date=May 2018}} that affects the way a person behaves. Emotions connected to morals include shame, pride, and discomfort - and these can change the way a person acts. Most importantly, shame and guilt have a large impact on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Tangney, J. P., Stuewig, J., &amp; Mashek, D. J. (2007). Moral emotions and moral behavior. ''[[Annual Review of Psychology]]'', 58, 345.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, culture highly affects human behavior. Children absorb the beliefs of certain{{which?|date=May 2018}} cultures  from such a young age that they are greatly affected as they grow up. These beliefs are taken into consideration{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} throughout daily life, which leads to people from different cultures acting differently. These differences affect the way different cultures and areas of the world interact and act.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Triandis, H. C.]] (1994). ''Culture and social behavior''. [[McGraw-Hill]] Book Company.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude===
{{Main|Attitude (psychology)}}
An attitude is an expression of favor or disfavor toward a person, place, thing, or event;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WYER, R. S. J. |year=1965 |title=Effect of child-rearing attitudes and behavior on children S responses to hypothetical social situations |publisher=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] 2(4), 480-486 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60622726?accountid=12347}} {{regreq}}&lt;/ref&gt; it alters between each individual. Everyone has a different attitude towards different things. A main factor that determines attitude is likes and dislikes. The more one likes something or someone the more one is willing to open up and accept what they have to offer. When one doesn’t like something, one is more likely to get defensive and shut down. An example of how one's attitude affects one's human behavior could be as simple as taking a child to the park or to the doctor. Children know they have fun at the park so their attitude becomes willing and positive, but when a doctor is mentioned, they shut down and become upset with the thought of pain. Attitudes can sculpt personalities and the way people view who we are. People with similar attitudes tend to stick together as interests and hobbies are common. This does not mean that people with different attitudes do not interact, the fact is they do. What it means is that specific attitudes can bring people together (e.g., religious groups). Attitudes have a lot to do with the mind which highly relates to human behavior. The way a human behaves depends a lot on how they look at the situation and what they expect to gain from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=KECMANOVIC, D. |year=1969 |title= The paranoid attitude as the common form of social behavior. ''Sociologija'', 11(4), 573-585 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60877639?accountid=1234}}7 {{regreq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hyphenation algorithm''' is a set of rules, especially one codified for implementation in a computer program, that decides at which points a word can be broken over two lines with a [[hyphen]]. For example, a hyphenation algorithm might decide that ''impeachment'' can be broken as ''impeach-ment'' or ''im-peachment'' but not ''impe-achment''.

One of the reasons for the complexity of the rules of word-breaking is that different "dialects" of English tend to differ on hyphenation{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}: [[American English]] tends to work on sound, but [[British English]] tends to look to the origins of the word and then to sound. There are also a large number of exceptions, which further complicates matters.

Some rules of thumb can be found in "On Hyphenation – Anarchy of Pedantry." Among the [[algorithm]]ic approaches to hyphenation, the one implemented in the [[TeX]] typesetting system is widely used. It is thoroughly documented in the first two volumes of
''[[Computers and Typesetting]]'' and in Francis Mark Liang's dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, Franklin Mark.  "[http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/ Word Hy-phen-a-tion by Com-pu-ter]". PhD dissertation, [[Stanford University]] Department of [[Computer Science]].  Report number STAN-CS-83-977, August 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of Liang's work was to get the algorithm as accurate as he practically could and to keep any exception dictionary small.

In TeX's original hyphenation patterns for American English, the exception list contains only 14 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = The Plain TeX hyphenation tables
 |url         = http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist/lib/hyphen.tex
 |accessdate  = June 23, 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== In TeX ==
Ports of the TeX hyphenation algorithm are available as libraries for several programming languages, including [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], [[PostScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and TeX can be made to show hyphens in the log by the command &lt;code&gt;\showhyphens&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[LaTeX]], hyphenation correction can be added by users by using:

&lt;pre&gt;\hyphenation{words}&lt;/pre&gt;

The \hyphenation command declares allowed hyphenation points in which words is a list of words, separated by spaces, in which each hyphenation point is indicated by a - character. For example,

&lt;pre&gt;\hyphenation{fortran er-go-no-mic}&lt;/pre&gt;

However, there are several limits. For example, the stock \hyphenation command accepts only [[ASCII]] letters by default and so it cannot be used to correct hyphenation for words with non-ASCII characters (like ''ä'', ''é'', ''ç''), which are very common in almost all languages except English. Simple workarounds exist, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyphenaccents TeX FAQ: Accented words aren't hyphenated], ibid [http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyphen How does hyphenation work in TeX?] and references therein&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impartiality''' (also called '''evenhandedness''' or '''fair-mindedness''') is a principle of [[justice]] holding that decisions should be based on [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective criteria]], rather than on the basis of [[bias]], [[prejudice]], or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons.

==Legal concept==
[[European Union law]] refers in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] to:
*A right to good administration:
:''Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled '''impartially''', fairly and within a [[reasonable time]] by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the [[European Union|Union]]'' (Article 41)
*A right to an effective remedy and to a [[fair trial]]:
:''Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and '''impartial''' tribunal previously established by law'' (Article 47).&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, Council and Commission, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], 26 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious concepts==

===Buddhism===
*Developing seven factors are conducive to the attainment of enlightenment: careful observation/attention/monitoring, curiosity/investigation of observed phenomena, effort/exertion/striving, anticipation/rapture, calm/tranquility, immersion/absorption, and equanimity/impartiality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*The "four sublime states" are benevolence, compassion, appreciation, and impartiality/equanimity, which are claimed to be prerequisite skills for rebirth in a realm of gods, called Brahma realm. (Accesstoinsight.com){{reliable source|date=March 2014}}

===Christianity===
*"For there is no respect of persons with God." —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 2:11, [[KJV]]
*"But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons." —[[Colossians]] 3:25, KJV
*"My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim that you have faith in our glorious Lord [[Jesus Christ]] if you favor some people more than others? For instance, suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in shabby clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, 'You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor'—well, doesn't this discrimination show that you are guided by wrong motives? Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? And yet, you insult the poor man! Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Aren't they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name you bear? Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the scriptures: '[[Love thy neighbor as thyself|Love your neighbor as yourself]]'. But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law." —[[Epistle of James]] 2:1-9, NLT
*"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." -[[Epistle of James]] 3:17, [[NIV]]

===Hinduism===
*"Truth, O [[Bhārat Gaṇarājya|Bharata]], as it exists in all the world, is of thirteen kinds. The forms that Truth assumes are impartiality, self-control, forgiveness, modesty, endurance, goodness, renunciation, contemplation, dignity, fortitude, compassion, and abstention from injury."—Truth, The Mahabharata, Santi Parva, Section CLXII.

===Islam===
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted." Quran 4:135.
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do." Quran 5:8.

===Judaism===

*"You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor." —[[Leviticus]] 19:15, [[English Standard Version]]
*"You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike." —[[Deuteronomy]] 1:17, ESV
*"These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment." —[[Book of Proverbs]] 24:23, KJV

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7113">In [[mathematics]], an '''indexed family''' is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some index set. For example, a ''family of [[real number]]s, indexed by the set of [[integer]]s'' is a collection of real numbers, where a given function selects for each integer one real number (possibly the same).

More formally, an indexed family is a  [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] together with its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''X''. Often the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set ''X'' are referred to as making up the family. In this view indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions. The set ''I'' is called the ''index (set)'' of the family, and ''X'' is the ''indexed set''.

==Mathematical statement==

'''Definition.''' Let ''I'' and ''X'' be sets and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a [[surjective function]], such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x\colon I &amp;\to X \\
 i &amp;\mapsto x_i = x(i),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then this establishes a '''family of elements in ''X'' indexed by ''I'' ''', which is denoted by (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; or simply (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), when the index set is assumed to be known. Sometimes angle brackets or braces are used instead of parentheses, the latter with the risk of mixing-up families with sets.

An indexed family can be turned into a set by considering the set &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{X} = \{ x_i : i \in I \} &lt;/math&gt;, that is, the image of ''I'' under ''x''. Since the mapping x is not required to be [[Injective function|injective]], there may exist &lt;math&gt;i,j \in I &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;| \mathcal{X}| \leq |I|,&lt;/math&gt; where |''A''| denotes the cardinality of the set ''A''.

The index set is not restricted to be countable, and, of course, a subset of a powerset may be indexed, resulting in an '''indexed family of sets'''. For the important differences in sets and families see below.

==Examples==

===Index notation===
Whenever [[index notation]] is used the indexed objects form a family. For example, consider the following sentence.
*The vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent. 
Here (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ {1, …, ''n''}&lt;/sub&gt; denotes a family of vectors. The ''i''-th vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; only makes sense with respect to this family, as sets are unordered and there is no ''i''-th vector of a set. Furthermore, [[linear independence]] is only defined as the property of a collection; it therefore is important if those vectors are linearly independent as a set or as a family. 

If we consider ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 2 and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1, 0), the ''set'' of them consists of only one element and is linearly independent, but the family contains the same element twice and is linearly dependent.

===Matrices===
Suppose a text states the following:
*A square matrix ''A'' is invertible, [[if and only if]] the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent. 

As in the previous example it is important that the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent as a family, not as a set. For Example, consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
The ''set'' of rows only consists of a single element (1, 1) and is linearly independent, but the matrix is not invertible. The ''family'' of rows contains two elements and is linearly dependent. The statement is therefore correct if it refers to the family of rows, but wrong if it refers to the set of rows. (The statement is also correct when "the rows" is interpreted as referring to a [[multiset]], in which the elements are also kept distinct but which lacks some of the structure of an indexed family.)

== Functions, sets and families ==
[[Surjective]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and families are formally equivalent, as any function ''f'' with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' induces a family (''f''(''i''))&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In practice, however, a family is viewed as a collection, not as a function: being ''an element of a family'' is equivalent with being in the range of the corresponding function. A family contains any element exactly once, [[if and only if]] the corresponding function is [[injective]]. 

Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], a family is a container and any set ''X'' gives rise to a family (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''x''∈''X''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus any set naturally becomes a family. For any family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; there is the set of all elements {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''i''∈''I''}, but this does not carry any information on multiple containment or the structure given by ''I''.  Hence, by using a set instead of the family, some information might be lost.

== Examples ==
Let '''n''' be the finite set {1, 2, …, ''n''}, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]].
* An [[ordered pair]] is a family indexed by the two element set '''2'''&amp;nbsp;= {1, 2}.
* An [[tuple|''n-''tuple]] is a family indexed by '''n'''.
* An infinite [[sequence]] is a family indexed by the [[natural numbers]].
* A [[tuple|list]] is an ''n-''tuple for an unspecified ''n'', or an infinite sequence.
* An ''n''×''m'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a family indexed by the [[cartesian product]] '''n'''&amp;times;'''m'''.
* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a family indexed by a [[directed set]].

==Operations on families==

Index sets are often used in sums and other similar operations. For example, if (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a family of numbers, the sum of all those numbers is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i\in I}a_i. &lt;/math&gt;

When (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[family of sets]], the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all those sets is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise for [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s and [[cartesian product]]s.

==Subfamily==

A family (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''subfamily''' of a family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, [[if and only if]] ''J'' is a subset of ''I'' and for all ''i'' in ''J'' 
:''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

==Usage in category theory==
{{main|Diagram (category theory)}}

The analogous concept in [[category theory]] is called a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]'''. A diagram is a [[functor]] giving rise to an indexed family of objects in a [[category theory|category]] '''''C''''', indexed by another category '''''J''''', and related by [[morphism]]s depending on two indices.

The '''Inland Waterways Commission''' was created by Congress in March 1907, at the request of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], to investigate the transportation crisis that recently had affected nation's ability to move its produce and industrial production efficiently.  The immediate crisis centered on insufficient railroad capacity developed by the private sector, and competing but neglected inland shipping, the navigation of which had been deemed under federal purview since 1824. The temporary commission lasted until the end of Roosevelt's presidency, but his conservationist [[Progressive Era|progressive]] interest was focused more than on transportation alone. The president wanted water projects to be considered for their multiple uses and in relation to other natural resources and asked for a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States.

Based on long-established legislative structure and more recent bureaucratic additions, the appointed members of the commission included, elected Representative [[Theodore E. Burton]] (R OH), as chairman, being also chair of the [[United States House Committee on Rivers and Harbors|House Committee on Rivers and Harbors]]; Senator [[Francis G. Newlands]] (D NV), as vice-chair; Senator [[William Warner (Missouri)|William Warner]] (R MO), and Senator [[John H. Bankhead]] (D AL).   Non-elected commissioners included government technocrats with experience in related fields, including [[Alexander Mackenzie (engineer)|Alexander Mackenzie]],  [[List of USACE Chiefs of Engineers|Chiefs of Engineers]], US Army, and the entity involved in federal navigation improvements since the beginning; [[William John McGee]], as secretary and from the [[United States Geological Survey]]; [[Frederick Haynes Newell]], the first Director of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|United States Reclamation Service]]; [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], and Herbert Knox Smith, from the Bureau of Corporations and predecessor to the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

By the end of that year, after the commission had looked at shipping on the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]], a minority of its members concluded that the nation needed a comprehensive water resources policy along with an autonomous commission of experts to plan and construct water projects that embraced entire river basins. At the end of 1907, and before Roosevelt presented the commission's preliminary report to Congress in late February, Senator Newlands introduced the first bill to create a permanent commission.  Over the next decade the subject of [[hydroelectricity]] would be closely studied, while Newlands drafted several more bills, with only an emasculated version becoming law in 1917.   While supportive of the commission's report generally, most members of Congress considered Newlands's plan either impractical or unconstitutional. Three years later, Congress all but eliminated the hope of centralized water planning when it replaced the Inland Waterways Commission with the Federal Power Commission, following passage of the [[Federal Power Act|Federal Water Power Act of 1920]].&lt;ref name="PisIWCre"&gt;Donald J. Pisani, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v018/18.4pisani.html Water Planning in the Progressive Era: The Inland Waterways Commission Reconsidered], Journal of Policy History 18.4 (2006) pp.389-418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential charge==
On  March 14, 1907, President Roosevelt appointed the Inland Waterway Commissioners and charged them to prepare and report "a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-2-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Instrument of the President, March 14, 1907.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced he said, by broad considerations of national policy, and the corresponding responsibilities and obligations, since the control of navigable waterways lies within the federal purview. He noted that while private sector energies had been directed largely toward industrial development in connection with field and forest, coal and iron, some of these material and power resources may already be largely depleted or abused. At the same time, the government's inland waterways have received scant attention as a whole, and it was becoming clear that the nation's streams should be considered and conserved as great natural resources. So far, works designed to control the waterways have usually been undertaken for a single purpose in mind, such as the improvement of navigation, the development of power, the irrigation of arid lands, the protection of lowlands from floods, or to supply water for domestic and manufacturing purposes. While the people's rights to these and similar water uses must be respected, the time had come he said, for local projects and uses of the inland waters to be viewed in a more comprehensive plan, designed for the benefit of the entire country; such a plan should consider and include all the uses to which streams may be put, and should bring together and coordinate the points of view of all water users.  While the task involved in the full and orderly development and control of the nation's river systems is a great one, it is certainly not too great for the government to approach, especially with results which seem to promise even greater returns.

The Commission's appointment followed numerous petitions from commercial organizations in the Mississippi Valley asking for such study, and he said, "the common knowledge that the railroads of the United States are no longer able to move crops and manufactures rapidly enough to secure the prompt transaction of the business of the nation, and there is small prospect of immediate relief." During the previous ten years, while the production of the northern interior States had doubled, the railroad facilities to transport it had increased only about 12%; there was reason to doubt railroad development could keep transportation abreast of production in the near-term.  "There appears to be but one complete remedy — the development of a complementary system of transportation by water. The present congestion affects chiefly the people of the Mississippi Valley, and they demand relief. When the congestion of which they complain is relieved, the whole Nation will share the good results."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"/&gt;

Roosevelt noted that while the nation's rivers are natural resources of first rank, they are also liable to become destructive agencies, endangering life and property; and that some of our most notable engineering enterprises have grown from the effort to control them. The vast quantity of annual suspended sediment and an enormous but unmeasured amount of earth-salts and soil-matter carried in solution not only causes the Mississippi channels to clog and flood the lowlands of the lower river, but also renders the flow variable and difficult to control.  Furthermore, he noted, the sediment and soil-matter is composed of the most fertile material of the fields and pastures drained by the tributaries. "Any plan for utilizing our inland waterways should consider floods and their control by forests and other means; the protection of bottom-lands from injury by overflow, and up-lands from loss by soil-wash; the physics of sediment-charged waters and the physical or other ways of purifying them; the construction of dams and locks, not only to facilitate navigation but to control the character and movement of the waters; and should look to the full use and control of our running waters and the complete "artificialization" of our waterways for the benefit of citizens as a whole." Not being possible to properly frame so large a plan for the control of rivers without taking account of the orderly development of other natural resources, Roosevelt asked that the Inland Waterways Commission consider the relations of the streams to the use of all the great permanent natural resources and their conservation to make and maintain prosperous homes.

Roosevelt noted that any feasible plan for utilizing inland waterways should recognize both the existing federal means, including the Departments of War, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor, and those in the States and their subdivisions.  Also it must not involve unduly burdensome expenditures from the national Treasury.  The cost necessarily will be large and proportional to the magnitude of potential benefits to the people, but it will be small in comparison to the $17 billion in current capital investments for steam railways nationally. That amount would have seemed enormous and incredible a half a century earlier, yet that investment was a continuous source of profit to the people. Without it, the nation's industrial progress would have been impossible.  In closing the President said that, the questions before the Inland Waterways Commission must necessarily relate to every part of the United States and affect every interest within its borders. Its plans should be considered in light of the widest modern knowledge of the country and its people, and from the most diverse points of view. As the committee's work sufficiently advanced, he would add more consulting members to the Commission, and ask that its recommendations be fully discussed with him, before they were submitted. The Commission's report should include both a general statement of the problems, as well as recommendations concerning the manner and means of attacking the problems perceived by them.

==Proceedings==
After initial conference and correspondence the organizational meeting was held in Washington DC from April 29 to May 3, 1907. A second meeting and inspection trip on the Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Passes was held May 13 to May 23. A third meeting and inspection trip took place from September 21 to October 13, which traveled on the Great Lakes from Cleveland to Duluth, on the Mississippi from St. Paul to Memphis, and on the Missouri River from Kansas City to St. Louis. A fourth meeting was held in the capitol beginning on November 25, for the purpose of preparing a preliminary report; the commission ended February 3, 1908.

During the organizational and inspecting meetings, thirty formal sessions were held in addition to informal meetings and conferences. At several of these sessions the entire Commission were present; at no session were there fewer than five Commissioners; the average attendance was over seven. During the meetings for report preparation there were 27 sessions, with an average attendance of seven.  Experts on matters entrusted to the Commission were present by invitation at 24 sessions; of these experts there were 24, several of whom attended two or more sessions, with most being former or current attaches of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].  Outside formal sessions, the Commissioners devoted much time to the consideration of the waterways and related matters. Two or three Commissioners jointly inspected the upper Missouri, the Columbia and Snake, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, and major tributaries; several Commissioners employed agencies under their direction in collating and digesting data relating to canals, water transportation, etc. Most of the Commissioners attended conventions and other meetings connected with the development of waterways and related interests.

At the 18th session a special committee of one, Gen. Alexander MacKenzie, was appointed to prepare a list of statutes and considerations relating to [[water power]], especially generation of [[hydroelectricity]]. Following action at the 23rd session, with the President presiding, a letter requesting a conference on the conservation of natural resources was framed and presented to the President on October 4, 1907; this later resulted in the first [[Conference of Governors]].  At the twenty-fifth session a committee of three was appointed to communicate further with the President on this matter, and to prepare a preliminary draft of their report; both committees reported at the fourth meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-3-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission], Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission report==
The investigations and discussions of the Inland Waterways Commission resulted in a series of 'Findings', containing their statements of fact connected with navigation and other uses of the inland waterways nationally, 'Recommendations', containing their conclusions on those findings, 'Inquiries in progress', containing certain matters still under discussion and an extensive 'Appendix'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17511">'''Jambhala''' (also known as Dzambhala, Dzambala, Zambala or Jambala) is the God of Wealth and appropriately a member of the Jewel Family (see [[Ratnasambhava]]). In [[Hindu mythology]], Jambhala is known as [[Kubera]]. Jambhala is also believed to be an emanation of [[Avalokitesvara]] or [[Chenrezig]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of Compassion. There are five different wealth Jambhalas; each has his own practice and [[mantra]] to help eliminate poverty and create financial stability.&lt;ref name="nepal"&gt;Nepalese and Tibetan Arts Blog. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://mydzi.blogspot.com/2008/04/five-jambala-dzambhala-and-mantra.html Five Jambala (Dzambhala) and Mantra].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyalten Sogdzin Rinpoche said that Jambhala is the protector of all [[Lineage (Buddhism)|Lineages]] and of all sentient beings from all sickness and difficulties. Jambhala is a Bodhisattva of material and spiritual wealth as well as many other things, especially of granting financial stability.
:”''Because in this world, there are all kinds of wrathful and negative emotions or bad spirits, and sometimes they will harm you and other sentient beings, Dzambhala must take on such a wrathful and powerful form to protect us from these harmful spirits and negative karma. Especially, Dzambhala helps us minimize or decrease all misfortunes and obstacles and helps us increase all good fortune and happiness''.”&lt;ref name="gyalten"&gt;His Holiness Gyalten Sogdzin Rinpoche.

The Teachings for the Dzambhala Enpowerment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
“'''Dzam'''” means “''Deity or gathering''”. “'''Bhah'''” means “''gold or wealth''”. “'''La'''” means “''to honor''”. “'''Dzambhala'''” means “''Precious Golden Deity, who gathers or brings the wealth of spirituality or Dharma and material security or accomplishment to our lives''”.&lt;ref name="gyalten"/&gt;

==The five Jambhalas==
The five Jambhalas are the manifestations of the compassion of [[Buddha]] and Bodhisattvas to guide sentient beings along the path to enlightenment. They have the essence of generosity and represent the activities of increasing benefit. Their aspirations are to help the poor and those suffering from ill-fortune.&lt;ref name="gaden"&gt;Gaden Shartse Dro-Phen Ling (甘丹东顶渡悲林). Access date= June 3rd, 2013.

===Green Jambhala===
{{see also|Akshobhya}}

'''Green Jambhala''' is the chief of the five Jambhalas and is the manifestation of [[Akshobhya|Buddha Akshobhya]], depicted standing upon a corpse and holding a mongoose in his left hand and a [[Kapala]] in his right hand.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;

He is usually shown with his consort and carrying a jewel producing mongoose in his left hand.&lt;ref name="red"&gt;Red Zambala. February 14th, 2013. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://redzambala.com/buddhism/buddha-aspects/who-is-red-zambala-in-buddhism.html Red Zambala].&lt;/ref&gt; Green Jambhala has bluish green colored body. He sits in the ''vajra'' position with [[Dakini]] in front of him. His right leg is panhandle with right foot is above a snail and lotus flower, while his left leg is kinked. On his left hand is an animal called Nehulay ([[mongoose]]) which spue out jewels from its mouth, his right hand holding ''[[Citron|Norbu]]''. The [[Dakini]] holding lotus flower in her hand. The Mantra of Green Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Karma Jambhala Ah Svaha'''''

===White Jambhala===
{{see also|Chenrezig|Avalokiteśvara}}
'''White Jambhala''' (or '''''Dzambhala Gapee''''' in Tibetan) is the compassionate manifestation of the [[Chenrezig|Bodhisattva Chenrezig]] ([[Guan Yin]]). He can remove the suffering of poverty and sickness, purify non-virtuous [[karma]] and karmic obstacles, avert disaster and sickness, and evolve [[bodhicitta]] mind.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

The Tibetan legend said that a revered high lama, [[Atisha]], was walking alone when he found a man starving and near death. After looking around and unable to find food for the old man, he cut flesh from his own body and offered it to the starving man. But the man refused to eat of his flesh. Being depressed and not knowing how else to help the man nearing death, Lama Atisha sat down next to him. At that point there was a blinding bright white light and before Atisha appeared [[Chenrezig]] of Compassion. He told Lama Atisha that he was going to manifest himself as the God of Wealth, Jambhala, and assure that those in poverty would suffer no longer.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;John W. Sheridan. June 29th, 2011. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://tantramantras.blogspot.com/2011/06/five-jambhala-wealth-gods.html The Five Jambhala Wealth Gods].&lt;/ref&gt;

As the manifestation of [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]], White Jambhala was born from his right eye. He sits on a [[snow lion]], although some artists depict him sitting on a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], and a [[mongoose]] in his left hand spits out precious diamonds and ornaments.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; White Jambhala has white colored body. He also holding a Wealth Banner in his left arm and a gold sword in his right. The Mantra of White Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Padma Krodha Arya Jambhala Hridaya Hum Phat'''''

When cultivating the "''Dragon-ridding White Jambhala Practice''", the practitioners can also pray that he will lead them to hidden treasures. In the olden days, Tibetan Tantric masters placed their precious teachings in caves. These teachings were sealed in the four elements of "earth, water, fire and wind". One needs to employ very special methods to retrieve these Dharma treasures. One must also know the location of the caves where these ancestry masters had practiced in seclusion. The practitioners may pray to the "Dragon-ridding White Jambhala" so that he will bring them to these caves where the treasures were hidden.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Yellow Jambhala===

{{see also|Vaisravana|Ratnasambhava}}
The '''Yellow Jambhala''' is considered the most popular and powerful of the Wealth Gods.&lt;ref name="john"/&gt; He is the emanation of [[Ratnasambhava|Buddha Ratnasambhava]]. He can remove poverty within the [[six realms]], increasing virtues, life span and wisdom.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

He is also said as an emanation of [[Vaisravana]], one of the "Four Great World-protecting Heavenly Kings". He is the guardian of light in Buddhism, a great charitable deity who grants fortune and protection. Lord Vaisravana lives in the northern region under the Four Heavens, at the northern crystal palace on the fourth level of Mount Sumeru. His servants are either ''yaksas'' or ''bhaisajya-yaksas''. According to the commentary on [[Lotus Sutra]], this heavenly king is extremely knowledgeable as his perpetual protection of the [[Buddha]]s has enabled him to receive many teachings.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

Yellow Jambhala has yellow colored body, he sits in the ''vajra'' position with his right leg is panhandle, his right foot is above a snail and lotus flower, and his left leg is kinked. He has one face and two arms. His left hand holding a [[mongoose]] named ''Nehulay'' which spews forth precious jewels from its mouth, while his right hand holding gems shaped fruit and leaf of lotus.&lt;ref name="tharpa"&gt;Tharpa Ling Jakarta – Indonesia Tibetan Tantric Buddhism.

In Tibetan Tantric images, the precious pagoda is replaced by the treasure-emitting mongoose.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt; Yellow Jambhala sits on a lotus, sun disk and moon disk.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; His mantra is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Jambhala Jalendraye Svaha'''''

===Red Jambhala===

[[File:GanpatiTibetan.jpg|thumb|right|Ganapati, Maha Rakta]]
{{see also|Ganesha|Ganesha in world religions|Vajrasattva}}
'''Red Jambhala''' is depicted practising together with his consort, the heavenly mother of wealth that is in charge of wealth in the human realm. In ancient times, this deity was practiced mainly by kings and royalty. His practice is most suitable to people in high power, or to pray for high power, for it can attract people, wealth and fame. One will enjoy wealth in abundance and shall be well respected and supported by people.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt; There is also the Red Jambhala magnetizing method that can bless the practitioner with marital bliss and a harmonious family.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

Red Jambhala is the manifisation of [[Vajrasattva]]. He has two faces and four arms and holds a treasury [[mongoose]] on his left hand. His Tibetan name is ''Dzambhala Mapo''.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; Red Jambhala has a red colored body, sits in the ''vajra'' position with [[Dakini]] in front of him. His right leg is panhandle with right foot is above a snail and lotus flower, his left leg is bent. He is holding an animal known as ''Nehulay'' ([[mongoose]]) in his left hand, his right hand holding ''Khorlo'' ([[Cakra]]), the [[Dakini]] holding [[Kapala]] containing [[Nectar]] in her left hand and ''Norbu Mebar'' in her right hand. The Mantra of Red Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Jambhala Jalendraye Dhanam Medehi Hrih Dakini Jambhala Sambhara Svaha'''''

Some people believe he is the [[Hindu]] God of Wealth [[Ganesha]],&lt;ref name="red"/&gt; the Red Ganapati,&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; and has the head of an elephant.&lt;ref name="john"/&gt; After the rise of [[Tantric Buddhism]], [[Ganesha]] became a Tantric wealth deity and is known as the "Lord of Provisions in Tibetan Tantrism". According to legend, Red Jambhala was in charge of the heavenly treasury that belonged to Lord [[Mahesvara]]’s son. Due to his extreme compassion, Red Jambhala had unfailingly answered the prayers of many worshippers. Enraged by Red Jambhala’s indiscriminate charity to both the good and evil, [[Dhammapala|Dharma guardian]] [[Mahakala]] decapitated him. It was only after the wealth deity repents that Mahakala plants an elephant’s head on his neck and receives him as a retainer.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Black Jambhala===
{{see also|Kubera|Amoghasiddhi}}

The '''Black Jambhala''' is also known as the Hindu God of Wealth, [[Kubera]].&lt;ref name="john"/&gt; Originated in ancient [[India]], he manifested from the waters of the river and gave the transmission of generating wealth to a king whose kingdom was undergoing extreme financial difficulties during that time. He also benefits the poor and those in solitary retreat that have a virtuous mind.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

Popularized by Shakyasribhadra, holding a skullcup and mongoose, naked and wrathful in a standing posture. He is the God of Wealth in Tibetan buddhism. With august guise he treads on the back of yellow rich man. Jambhala, Black (Tibetan: dzam bha la, nag po), a wealth deity popularized in Tibet by Bari Lotsawa (b.1040) and the Kashmiri teacher [[Shakyashri]] Bhadra.

" ... the Lord Jambhala, with a body black in colour, having the appearance of a dwarf, naked, sexually aroused, pot-bellied, with pierced ears, three bulging bloodshot eyes, brown hair flowing upwards and bared fangs, in a standing position, the right leg bent, and the left straight. He has one head and two arms. The right hand holds the top of a skull in front of his chest as a blood container, and the left hand holds a mongoose expelling wish fulfilling jewels. On his head is a crown of five skulls in the shape of the five-Buddha crown; around his neck is a string of 50 pray beads made of human skulls, with five-color snakes as bracelets on hands, feet and neck. He shows anger on his face, standing with his right leg bent, his left leg extended, the right leg is extended pressing upon the head of the yellow Lord of Wealth, adorned with various gold ornaments, lying face down beneath Black Jambhala's feet." (Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup, 1497-1557).

He is the manifestation of [[Amoghasiddhi|Amoghasiddhi Buddha]] by the request of [[Shakyamuni|Buddha Shakyamuni]] to turn the [[wheel of Dharma]] to benefit sentient beings who are suffering from poverty. He will enable all endeavors to be perfectly accomplished and purify all bad luck and obstacles, prevent theft, bad debts and loss of wealth.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt; Jambhala has a black colored body. He is depicted in a standing position over a human body, symbolizes to subdue human’s ego and eliminate human’s greed. His right hand holding Gems Pot and his left hand holding an animal named Nehulay ([[mongoose]]) which spue out jewels from its mouth. Black Jambhala also wears a snake necklace on his body. The Mantra of Black Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Jambhala Jalendraye Bashu Dharini Svaha''''' and
:""Om Indzali Mu Kam Dzamali Soha""

==The practice==
In [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantrism]], Jambhala practice is an expedient and worldly cultivation-method. Tantric cultivation is divided into “Generation Stage” and “Completion Stage”; ''Generation Stage'' is the foundation while ''Completion Stage'' consists of practices pertaining to the holy truth and the transcendental methods. Jambhala practice is a fundamental cultivation-method.&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;Singapore True Buddha School Yuan Xi Tang. Access date= April 3rd, 2013. [http://www.padmakumara.org/oldtbsn/teach/jambhala.htm The Jambhala Practice of Tantric Buddhism].&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of five Jambhalas practices is [[Bodhicitta]]. Practitioners should generate the altruistic ''intention of compassion'' ([[Bodhicitta]]), and practice generosity. The practice can remove poverty within the [[six realms]] and increase one’s merits, wisdom and lifespan. All their material and spiritual needs will be met.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

The [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]] of five Jambhalas summons immense positive wealth energies upon the participants. The [[Buddhist]]s believe that wealth results from one’s past actions, but this puja itself also plays a significant role in changing the course of one’s financial situation. Gaden Shartse said:&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;
: “''With a sincere motivation to accumulate merit, purify our negative karma, as well as make prayers for all sentient beings to be freed from all poverty and all sufferings, without doubt - one will certainly receive the vast blessings and protection of the wealth deities''.”

Some people claim that cultivating the Jambhala practice will increase one’s greed. Although the spiritual practitioner has the desire to gain great fortune, his body, mind and speech are nonetheless gradually purified in the process of practicing the Tantric method.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Reciting mantras===
Chanting the mantra of every Jambhala is believed to be more beneficial if the chanter has received oral transmissions from a teacher who holds the teaching [[Lineage (Buddhism)|Lineage]].&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;

===Pouring water over statues===
The legend said that while [[Sakyamuni|Sakyamuni Buddha]] was teaching the [[Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra|Maha Prajna-Paramita Sutra]], the jealous Devadatta threw rocks at the [[Buddha]]. But instead, the rocks hit White and Yellow Jambhalas on their heads and hit Black Jambhala on the stomach.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; Buddha then came over to Jambhala and blessed him; from his hand came a white, nectar-like substance of wisdom and compassion and love, and touched Jambhala’s head. Jambhala felt very blissful, happy, calm, and cleaned his impurities and obstructions, and his wounds. Jambhala immediately bowed down to Buddha and thanked him.&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;

[[Sakyamuni|Sakyamuni Buddha]] said to him, “As I have healed you and I poured this holy nectar onto you, in the future any one of my students or student’s students who invokes your power and pours water onto your head - bestow on them wealth, give them the two types of wealth, material wealth and spiritual wealth, more importantly spiritual wealth.” After that, Jambhala folded his hands and said, “I will do as you have said and I promise that I will do that.”&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;

That story has become the basis for the practitioners of ''Jambhala Puja'' to pour water over their statues or to place their statues under the falling water of six-step waterfalls.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43421">{{Expand German|Karnaugh-Veitch-Diagramm|date=February 2018}}
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|right|An example Karnaugh map. This image actually shows two Karnaugh maps: for the function ''ƒ'', using [[minterm]]s (colored rectangles) and for its complement, using [[maxterm]]s (gray rectangles). In the image, ''E''() signifies a sum of minterms, denoted in the article as &lt;math&gt;\sum m_i&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The '''Karnaugh map''' ('''KM''' or '''K-map''') is a method of simplifying [[Boolean algebra]] expressions. [[Maurice Karnaugh]] introduced it in 1953&lt;ref name="Karnaugh_1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis_1962"/&gt; as a refinement of [[Edward Veitch]]'s 1952 '''Veitch chart''',&lt;ref name="Veitch_1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; which actually was a rediscovery of [[Allan Marquand]]'s 1881 ''logical diagram''&lt;ref name="Marquand_1881"/&gt; aka '''Marquand diagram'''&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; but with a focus now set on its utility for switching circuits.&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; Veitch charts are therefore also known as ''Marquand–Veitch diagrams'',&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; and Karnaugh maps as ''Karnaugh–Veitch maps'' (''KV maps'').

The Karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of humans' pattern-recognition capability.&lt;ref name="Karnaugh_1953"/&gt; It also permits the rapid identification and elimination of potential [[race condition]]s.

The required Boolean results are transferred from a [[truth table]] onto a two-dimensional grid where, in Karnaugh maps, the cells are ordered in [[Gray code]],&lt;ref name="Wakerly_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions, while each cell value represents the corresponding output value. Optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified, which represent the terms of a [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] of the logic in the original truth table.&lt;ref name="Belton_1998"/&gt; These terms can be used to write a minimal Boolean expression representing the required logic.

Karnaugh maps are used to simplify real-world logic requirements so that they can be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A [[Conjunctive normal form|sum-of-products expression]] can always be implemented using [[AND gate]]s feeding into an [[OR gate]], and a [[Disjunctive normal form|product-of-sums expression]] leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate.&lt;ref name="Dodge_2016"/&gt; Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]], can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.&lt;ref name="Cook_2012"/&gt; Diagrammatic and mechanical methods for minimizing simple logic expressions have existed since at least the medieval times. More systematic methods for minimizing complex expressions began to be developed in the early 1950s, but until the mid to late 1980's the Karnaugh map was the most common used in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1097|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Karnaugh maps are used to facilitate the simplification of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] functions. For example, consider the Boolean function described by the following [[truth table]].

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|+ Truth table of a function

Following are two different notations describing the same function in unsimplified Boolean algebra, using the Boolean variables {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}}, {{mvar|C}}, {{mvar|D}}, and their inverses.

*&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = \sum_{}m_i, i \in \{6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[minterm]]s to map (i.e., rows that have output 1 in the truth table).
*&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = \prod_{}M_i, i \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 15\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[maxterm]]s to map (i.e., rows that have output 0 in the truth table).

===Karnaugh map===
[[File:Karnaugh6.gif|center|thumb|400px|K-map drawn on a torus, and in a plane. The dot-marked cells are adjacent.]]
[[File:K-map minterms A.svg|thumb|right|K-map construction. Instead of the output values (the rightmost values in the truth table), this diagram shows a decimal representation of the input ABCD (the leftmost values in the truth table), therefore it is not a Karnaugh map.]]
[[File:Torus from rectangle.gif|thumb|right|In three dimensions, one can bend a rectangle into a torus.]]

1)In this time the four input variables can be combined in 16 different ways, so the truth table has 16 rows, and the K-map has 16 positions. The K-map is therefore arranged in a 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 grid.

The row and column indices (shown across the top, and down the left side of the Karnaugh map) are ordered in [[Gray code]] rather than binary numerical order. Gray code ensures that only one variable changes between each pair of adjacent cells. Each cell of the completed Karnaugh map contains a binary digit representing the function's output for that combination ofÀ inputs.

After the Karnaugh map has been constructed, it is used to find one of the simplest possible forms — a [[Canonical form (Boolean expression)|canonical form]] — for the information in the truth table. Adjacent 1s in the Karnaugh map represent opportunities to simplify the expression. The minterms ('minimal terms') for the final expression are found by encircling groups of 1s in the map. Minterm groups must be rectangular and must have an area that is a power of two (i.e., 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8…). Minterm rectangles should be as large as possible without containing any 0s. Groups may overlap in order to make each one larger. The optimal groupings in the example below are marked by the green, red and blue lines, and the red and green groups overlap. The red group is a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 square, the green group is a 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1 rectangle, and the overlap area is indicated in brown.

The cells are often denoted by a shorthand which describes the logical value of the inputs that the cell covers. For example, {{mvar|AD}} would mean a cell which covers the 2x2 area where {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}} are true, i.e. the cells numbered 13, 9, 15, 11 in the diagram above. On the other hand, {{mvar|A{{overline|D}}}} would mean the cells where {{mvar|A}} is true and {{mvar|D}} is false (that is, {{mvar|{{overline|D}}}} is true).

The grid is [[torus|toroidally]] connected, which means that rectangular groups can wrap across the edges (see picture). Cells on the extreme right are actually 'adjacent' to those on the far left, in the sense that the corresponding input values only differ by one bit's; similarly, so are those at the very top and those at the bottom. Therefore, {{mvar|A{{overline|D}}}} can be a valid term—it includes cells 12 and 8 at the top, and wraps to the bottom to include cells 10 and 14—as is {{mvar|{{overline|B}}, {{overline|D}}}}, which includes the four corners.

===Solution===
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|Diagram showing two K-maps. The K-map for the function f(A, B, C, D) is shown as colored rectangles which correspond to minterms. The brown region is an overlap of the red 2×2 square and the green 4×1 rectangle. The K-map for the inverse of f is shown as gray rectangles, which correspond to maxterms.]]

Once the Karnaugh map has been constructed and the adjacent 1s linked by rectangular and square boxes, the algebraic minterms can be found by examining which variables stay the same within each box.

For the red grouping:
* ''A'' is the same and is equal to 1 throughout the box, therefore it should be included in the algebraic representation of the red minterm.
* ''B'' does not maintain the same state (it shifts from 1 to 0), and should therefore be excluded.
* ''C'' does not change. It is always 0, so its complement, NOT-C, should be included. Thus, {{mvar|{{overline|C}}}} should be included.
* ''D'' changes, so it is excluded.

Thus the first minterm in the Boolean sum-of-products expression is {{mvar|A{{overline|C}}}}.

For the green grouping, ''A'' and ''B'' maintain the same state, while ''C'' and ''D'' change. ''B'' is 0 and has to be negated before it can be included. The second term is therefore {{mvar|A{{overline|B}}}}. Note that it is acceptable that the green grouping overlaps with the red one.

In the same way, the blue grouping gives the term {{mvar|BC{{overline|D}}}}.

The solutions of each grouping are combined: the normal form of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;AB\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the Karnaugh map has guided a simplification of
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              f(A, B, C, D) = {} &amp;\overline{A}BC\overline{D} + A\overline{B}\,\overline{C}\,\overline{D} + A\overline{B}\,\overline{C}D + A\overline{B}C\overline{D} + {}\\
                                 &amp;A\overline{B}CD + AB\overline{C}\,\overline{D} + AB\overline{C}D + ABC\overline{D}\\
                            = {} &amp;AB\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It would also have been possible to derive this simplification by carefully applying the [[Boolean algebra (logic)#Axiomatizing Boolean algebra|axioms of boolean algebra]], but the time it takes to do that grows exponentially with the number of terms.

===Inverse===
The inverse of a function is solved in the same way by grouping the 0s instead.

The three terms to cover the inverse are all shown with grey boxes with different colored borders:
*brown: {{mvar|{{overline|A}}, {{overline|B}}}}
*gold: {{mvar|{{overline|A}}, {{overline|C}}}}
*blue: {{mvar|BCD}}

This yields the inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{f(A,B,C,D)} = \overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + BCD&lt;/math&gt;

Through the use of [[De Morgan's laws]], the [[product of sums]] can be determined:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(A,B,C,D) &amp;= \overline{\overline{f(A,B,C,D)}} \\
            &amp;= \overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + BCD} \\
            &amp;= \left(\overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{B}}\right) \left(\overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{C}}\right) \left(\overline{BCD}\right) \\
            &amp;= \left(A + B\right)\left(A + C\right)\left(\overline{B} + \overline{C} + \overline{D}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Don't cares===
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 don't care.svg|thumb|The value of {{tmath|f(A,B,C,D)}} for ''ABCD'' = 1111 is replaced by a "don't care". This removes the green term completely and allows the red term to be larger. It also allows blue inverse term to shift and become larger]]

Karnaugh maps also allow easy minimizations of functions whose truth tables include "[[Don't-care (logic)|don't care]]" conditions. A "don't care" condition is a combination of inputs for which the designer doesn't care what the output is. Therefore, "don't care" conditions can either be included in or excluded from any rectangular group, whichever makes it larger. They are usually indicated on the map with a dash or X.

The example on the right is the same as the example above but with the value of ''f''(1,1,1,1) replaced by a "don't care". This allows the red term to expand all the way down and, thus, removes the green term completely.

This yields the new minimum equation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(A,B,C,D) = A + BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the first term is just {{mvar|A}}, not {{mvar|A{{overline|C}}}}. In this case, the don't care has dropped a term (the green rectangle); simplified another (the red one); and removed the race hazard (removing the yellow term as shown in the following section on race hazards).

The inverse case is simplified as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{f(A,B,C,D)} = \overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + \overline{A}D&lt;/math&gt;

==Race hazards==
===Elimination===
Karnaugh maps are useful for detecting and eliminating [[race condition]]s. Race hazards are very easy to spot using a Karnaugh map, because a race condition may exist when moving between any pair of adjacent, but disjoint, regions circumscribed on the map. However, because of the nature of Gray coding, ''adjacent'' has a special definition explained above – we're in fact moving on a torus, rather than a rectangle, wrapping around the top, bottom, and the sides.

* In the example [[Karnaugh map#Solution|above]], a potential race condition exists when ''C'' is 1 and ''D'' is 0, ''A'' is 1, and ''B'' changes from 1 to 0 (moving from the blue state to the green state). For this case, the output is defined to remain unchanged at 1, but because this transition is not covered by a specific term in the equation, a potential for a ''glitch'' (a momentary transition of the output to 0) exists.
* There is a second potential glitch in the same example that is more difficult to spot: when ''D'' is 0 and ''A'' and ''B'' are both 1, with C changing from 1 to 0 (moving from the blue state to the red state). In this case the glitch wraps around from the top of the map to the bottom.

[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|Race hazards are present in this diagram.]]
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|Above diagram with consensus terms added to avoid race hazards.]]

Whether glitches will actually occur depends on the physical nature of the implementation, and whether we need to worry about it depends on the application. In clocked logic, it is enough that the logic settles on the desired value in time to meet the timing deadline. In our example, we are not considering clocked logic.

In our case, an additional term of &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; would eliminate the potential race hazard, bridging between the green and blue output states or blue and red output states: this is shown as the yellow region (which wraps around from the bottom to the top of the right half) in the adjacent diagram.

The term is [[logic redundancy|redundant]] in terms of the static logic of the system, but such redundant, or [[consensus theorem|consensus terms]], are often needed to assure race-free dynamic performance.

Similarly, an additional term of &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}D&lt;/math&gt; must be added to the inverse to eliminate another potential race hazard. Applying De Morgan's laws creates another product of sums expression for ''f'', but with a new factor of &lt;math&gt;\left(A + \overline{D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===2-variable map examples===
The following are all the possible 2-variable, 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 Karnaugh maps. Listed with each is the minterms as a function of &lt;math&gt;\sum m()&lt;/math&gt; and the race hazard free (''see [[#Race hazards|previous section]]'') minimum equation. A minterm is defined as an expression that gives the most minimal form of expression of the mapped variables. All possible horizontal and vertical interconnected blocks can be formed. These blocks must be of the size of the powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...). These expressions create a minimal logical mapping of the minimal logic variable expressions for the binary expressions to be mapped. Here are all the blocks with one field.

A block can be continued across the bottom, top, left, or right of the chart. That can even wrap beyond the edge of the chart for variable minimization. This is because each logic variable corresponds to each vertical column and horizontal row. A visualization of the k-map can be considered cylindrical. The fields at edges on the left and right are adjacent, and the top and bottom are adjacent. K-Maps for four variables must be depicted as a donut or torus shape. The four corners of the square drawn by the k-map are adjacent. Still more complex maps are needed for 5 variables and more.

In [[Latin]] the phrase, "know thyself," is given as ''nosce te ipsum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nosce%20te%20ipsum |title=Nosce te ipsum - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''temet nosce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |title=AllExperts.com: temet nosce |publisher=allexperts.com |date= |accessdate=17 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231172656/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |archivedate=31 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim, or aphorism, "know thyself" has had a variety of meanings attributed to it in literature.

==Attribution==
According to a proposal by De Lubicz and Lamy (1956), the Greek aphorism may have been adopted from [[Ancient Egypt]]: there are two parts of the ancient [[Luxor Temple]], the External Temple, where the beginners were allowed to enter and the Internal Temple where a person was only allowed to enter after proven worthy and ready to acquire more knowledge and insights. One of the proverbs of the External Temple is "The body is the house of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie||title=Her-Bak: The Living Face of Ancient Egypt|date=1954|publisher=Hodder and Staughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Internal Temple, one of the many proverbs is "Man, know thyself, and you are going to know the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie|title=Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate|date=1978|publisher=Inner Traditions International}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Greek aphorism has been attributed to at least the following [[Seven Sages of Greece|ancient Greek sages]]:

* [[Periander]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 10.24.1 mentions a controversy over whether Periander should be listed as the seventh sage instead of Myson.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] attributes it to Thales (''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|Lives]]'' I.40), but also notes that Antisthenes in his ''Successions of Philosophers'' attributes it to [[Phemonoe]], a mythical Greek poet, though admitting that it was appropriated by Chilon. In a discussion of moderation and self-awareness, the Roman poet [[Juvenal]] quotes the phrase in Greek and states that the precept descended ''e caelo'' (from heaven) (''[[Satires of Juvenal#Satire XI: Dinner and a Moral|Satires]]'' 11.27).  The 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the ''[[Suda]]'' recognized Chilon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&lt;/ref&gt; and Thales&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/theta/17&lt;/ref&gt; as the sources of the maxim "Know Thyself."

The authenticity of all such attributions is doubtful; according to Parke  and Wormell (1956), "The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages."&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D.

==Usage==
Listed chronologically:
===By Aeschylus===
The ancient Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] uses the maxim "know thyself" in his play ''[[Prometheus Bound]].'' The play about a mythological sequence, thereby places the maxim within the context of Greek mythology. In this play, the demi-god [[Prometheus]] first rails at the Olympian gods, and against what he believes to be the injustice of his having been bound to a cliffside by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods.  The demi-god [[Oceanus]] comes to Prometheus to reason with him, and cautions him that he should "know thyself".&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheys Bound'', [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%82_%CE%94%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82 v. 309]: ''γίγνωσκε σαυτὸν''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, Oceanus is telling Prometheus that he should know better than to speak ill of the one who decides his fate and accordingly, perhaps he should better know his place in the "great order of things."

===By Socrates===
One of [[Socrates|Socrates's]] students, the historian [[Xenophon]], described some of the instances of Socrates's use of the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' in his history titled: ''Memorabilia.''  In this writing, Xenophon portrayed his teacher's use of the maxim as an organizing theme for Socrates's lengthy dialogue with Euthydemus.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon describes Socrates use of 'Know Thyself' in Memorabilia 4.2.24 &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0208:book%3D4:chapter%3D2:section%3D24&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Plato===
[[Plato]], another student of Socrates, employs the maxim 'Know Thyself' extensively by having the character of Socrates use it to motivate his dialogues.  Benjamin Jowett's index to his translation of the ''[[Dialogues of Plato]]'' lists six dialogues which discuss or explore the Delphic maxim: 'know thyself.' These dialogues (and the [[Stephanus numbers]] indexing the pages where these discussions begin) are ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' (164D), ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' (343B), ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (229E), ''[[Philebus]]'' (48C), ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (II.923A), ''[[First Alcibiades|Alcibiades I]]'' (124A, 129A, 132C).&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by [[Benjamin Jowett]], M.A. in Five Volumes. 3rd edition revised and corrected (Oxford University Press, 1892), (See Index: Knowledge; 'know thyself' at Delphi).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', Critias refers to the maxim consistently with the view expressed in the ''[[Suda]]'', with Critias saying, "for they imagined that 'Know Thyself!' was a piece of advice which the god gave and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in."&lt;ref&gt;Critias states the meaning of 'know thyself' in Plato's Charmides (165a),&lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D165a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern words Critias gives his opinion that 'Know Thyself!' was an admonition to those entering the sacred temple to remember or know their place and Critias says, " 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same.  Notice that when the words of Critias are written, 'thyself' and 'temperate' are punctuated with exclamation marks in the English translations, as if they were commands.&lt;ref&gt;Critias says 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same in Plato's Charmides (164e), &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D164e&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the balance of the ''Charmides'', Plato has Socrates lead a longer inquiry as to how we may gain knowledge of ourselves.

In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Socrates uses the maxim 'know thyself' as his explanation to Phaedrus to explain why he has no time for the attempts to rationally explain mythology or other far flung topics. Socrates says, "But I have no leisure for them at all; and the reason, my friend, is this: I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it seems to me ridiculous, when I do not yet know that, to investigate irrelevant things."&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates]] uses the saying 'know thyself' to explain what is important for him to know. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text%3DPhaedrus:section%3D229e&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Socrates lauds the authors of [[Laconic phrase|pithy and concise sayings]] delivered precisely at the right moment and says that Lacedaemon, or [[Sparta]], educates its people to that end.  Socrates lists the Seven Sages as Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus, Myson, and Chilon, who he says are gifted in that Lacedaemonian art of concise words "twisted together, like a bowstring, where a slight effort gives great force."&lt;ref&gt;Socrates lists the authors of Delphi's sayings. &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Prot.+343a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates says examples of them are, "the far-famed inscriptions, which are in all men's mouths,--'Know thyself,' and 'Nothing too much'.".&lt;ref&gt;Socrates seeks to understand 'Know thyself' as pithy, concise wisdom.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343b&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Having lauded the maxims, Socrates then spends a great deal of time getting to the bottom of what one of them means, the saying of Pittacus, 'Hard is it to be good.'  The irony here is that although the sayings of Delphi bear 'great force,' it is not clear how to live life in accordance with their meanings.  Although, the concise and broad nature of the sayings suggests the active partaking in the usage and personal discovery of each maxim; as if the intended nature of the saying lay not in the words but the self-reflection and self-referencing of the person thereof.
 
In Plato's ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue, Socrates refers back to the same usage of 'know thyself' from ''Phaedrus'' to build an example of the ridiculous for Protarchus.  Socrates says, as he did in Phaedrus, that people make themselves appear ridiculous when they are trying to know obscure things before they know themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates use of 'Know thyself' in Philebus (48c) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Phileb.+48c&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also alluded to the fact that understanding 'thyself,' would have a greater yielded factor of understanding the nature of a human being. Syllogistically, understanding oneself would enable thyself to have an understanding of others as a result.

===Later usage===

The ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century encyclopedia of Greek knowledge, says: "the proverb is applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are",&lt;ref&gt;'Know Thyself' as an admonition, in "Know Thyself". ''Suda'' On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 &lt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "know thyself" is a warning to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude.&lt;ref&gt;'Know the value of Thyself' rightly, in  "Know Thyself".

One work by the Medieval philosopher [[Peter Abelard]] is entitled ''Scito te ipsum'' (“know yourself”) or ''Ethica''.

From 1539 onwards the phrase ''nosce te ipsum'' and its Latin variants were often used in the anonymous texts written for [[Anatomical Fugitive Sheet|anatomical fugitive sheets]] printed in Venice as well as for later anatomical atlases printed throughout Europe. The 1530s fugitive sheets are the first instances in which the phrase was applied to knowledge of the human body attained through dissection.&lt;ref&gt;William Schupbach, The Paradox of Rembrandt's "Anatomy of Dr. Tulp (Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine: London, 1982), pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1651 [[Thomas Hobbes]] used the term ''nosce teipsum'' which he translated as 'read thyself' in his famous work, ''[[The Leviathan]]''. He was responding to a popular philosophy at the time that you can learn more by studying others than you can from reading books. He asserts that one learns more by studying oneself: particularly the feelings that influence our thoughts and motivate our actions. As Hobbes states, "but to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=The Leviathan |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |work=Civil peace and social unity through perfect government |publisher=Oregon State University: Phl 302, Great Voyages: the History of Western Philosophy from 1492-1776, Winter 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130924/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734 [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a poem entitled "An Essay on Man, Epistle II", which begins "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is Man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Pope]] begins his Essay on Man Epistle II "Know then thyself."&lt;http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/03/hbc-90002748&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1735 [[Carl Linnaeus]] published the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in which he described humans (''[[Homo]]'') with the simple phrase "''Nosce te ipsum''".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_XUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750 [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', observed the great difficulty of knowing one's self, with: "There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Franklin]] observes that it is extremely hard to know oneself. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=MYkTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Autobiography%2C%20Sayings%20of%20Poor%20Richard%2C%20Letters&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754 [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] lauded the "inscription of the Temple at Delphi" in his ''[[Discourse on the Origin of Inequality]]''.

In 1831, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote a poem entitled "Γνώθι Σεαυτόν", or Gnothi Seauton ('Know Thyself'), on the theme of 'God in thee.' The poem was an anthem to Emerson's belief that to 'know thyself' meant knowing the [[God]] which Emerson felt existed within each person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Gnothe Seauton, Poem 1831. &lt;http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/poems/gnothi.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 [[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote a poem entitled "Self Knowledge" in which the text centers on the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' beginning, 'Gnôthi seauton!--and is this the prime And heaven-sprung adage of the olden time!--' and ending with 'Ignore thyself, and strive to know thy God!' Coleridge's text references JUVENAL, xi. 27.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote the poem 'Self Knowledge' discussing 'Gnôthi seauton' or know thyself. &lt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/37203/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] has his 16th-century alter ego in his letter to Francis Bacon mention a book he intended to call ''Nosce te ipsum''.

In 1904 Sarah Ida Shaw and Elanor Dorcas Pond founded the [[Delta Delta Delta]] fraternity. Part of their motto is Self-Knowledge, Self-Reverence, and Self-Discipline.

[[The Wachowskis]] used one of the Latin versions (''temet nosce'') of this aphorism as inscription over the Oracle's door in their movies ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Temet+Nosce%22%22The+Matrix%22+Oracle occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patrickmcgrath.blogspot.it/2011/01/know-thyself-most-important-art-lesson.html#.Uk2k-NdxNok | title="Know Thyself".

''Nosce te ipsum'' is also the motto for the [[Thompson (surname)|Scottish clan Thompson]].

'''Mokomokai''' are the preserved heads of [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of [[New Zealand]], where the faces have been decorated by [[tā moko]] [[tattoo]]ing.  They became valuable trade items during the [[Musket Wars]] of the early 19th century.

==Moko==
{{Main|Tā moko}}
Moko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century.  In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status.  There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high-ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage, Cultural Rights, Cultural Diversity: New Developments in International Law,
 edited by Silvia Borelli, Federico Lenzerini, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Moko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives.  Each moko was unique and contained information about the person’s rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits.  Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors.  Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict [[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] and protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mokomokai==
When someone with moko died, often the [[head]] would be preserved.  The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with [[Phormium|flax]] fibre and [[Gum-digger#Uses of kauri gum|gum]].  The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days.  It was then treated with [[shark oil]].  Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TeIMoko.html NZETC: Mokomokai: Preserving the past] Accessed 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered [[war trophy|trophies of war]], would be displayed on the [[Marae#Marae in New Zealand|marae]] and mocked.  They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musket Wars==
{{Main|Musket Wars}}
In the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to [[firearm]]s, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours.  This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves.  During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and [[ammunition]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them.  They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order.  The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831.  In 1831 the [[Governor of New South Wales]] issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because of [[market saturation]].  By 1840 when the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed, and New Zealand became a [[British Empire|British colony]], the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Tano (2004), pp.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janes &amp; Conaty (2005), pp.156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robley collection==
{{Main|Horatio Gordon Robley}}
[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the [[New Zealand land wars]] in the 1860s.  He was interested in [[ethnology]] and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator.  He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, ''Moko; or Maori Tattooing'', which was published in 1896.  After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government.  When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=sst/&gt;

==Repatriation==
More recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Museum of New Zealand]] for storage, though not display.  It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223000152/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4353909a20455.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=The trade in preserved Maori heads |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Wellington. 7 April 2000.

'''Moral equivalence''' is a term used in political debate, usually to deny that a moral comparison can be made of two sides in a conflict, or in the actions or tactics of two sides.

The term had some currency in polemic debates about the [[Cold War]], and currently the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. "Moral equivalence" began to be used as a polemic ''term-of-retort'' to "[[moral relativism]]", which had been gaining use as an indictment against political foreign policy that appeared to use only a [[situational ethics|situation]]-based application of widely held [[Ethics|ethical]] standards.

International conflicts are sometimes viewed similarly, and interested parties periodically urge both sides to conduct a ceasefire and negotiate their differences. However these negotiations may prove difficult in that both parties in a conflict believe that they are [[superiority complex|morally superior]] to the other, and are unwilling to negotiate on basis of moral equivalence.

==Cold War==
In the [[Cold War]] context, the term was and is most commonly used by anti-Communists as an accusation of [[formal fallacy]] for [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] criticisms of United States foreign policy and military conduct.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Many such people believed in the idea that the [[United States]] was intrinsically benevolent, that the extension of its power, influence and hegemony was an extension of benevolence and would bring freedom to those people subject to that hegemony. Therefore, those who opposed the United States were by definition evil, trying to deny its benevolence to people. The USSR and its allies, in contrast, practiced a [[totalitarian]] ideology. A territory under US hegemony thus would be freed from possibly being in the camp of the totalitarian power and would help to weaken it. Thus, all means were justified in keeping territories away from Soviet influence in this way. This extended to countries not under Soviet influence but instead said to be sympathetic at all in any way with it. Therefore, [[Chile]] under [[Salvador Allende]] was not under Soviet domination, but removing him would help weaken the USSR by removing a government ruled with the help of a [[Communist Party]]. The big picture, they would say, justified the tortures carried out by the [[Augusto Pinochet]] dictatorship as it served to weaken the totalitarian Communist camp and in time bring about the freedom of those under its domination.

Some of those who criticized US foreign policy at the time contended that US power in the [[Cold War]] was used only to pursue an [[Capitalism|economically-driven agenda]]. They claim that the underlying economic motivation eroded any claims of [[Moral hierarchy|moral superiority]], leaving the hostile acts in ([[Korean War|Korea]], [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]], [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]]) to stand on their own. In contrast, those who justified US interventions in the Cold War period always cast these as being motivated by the need to contain totalitarianism and thus fulfilled a higher moral imperative.

An early popularizer of the expression was [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], who was United States ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration. Kirkpatrick published an article called "The Myth of Moral Equivalence" in 1986, in which sharply criticized those who she alleged were claiming that there was "no moral difference" between the [[Soviet Union]] and democratic states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]. ''[http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1986&amp;month=01 The Myth of Moral Equivalence]'',   January 1986, Vol. 15, No. 1, ''[[Imprimis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, very few critics of United States policies in the Cold War era argued that there was a moral equivalence between the two sides. [[Communists]], for instance, argued that the Soviet Union was morally superior to its adversaries. Kirkpatrick herself was one of the most outspoken voices calling for the US to support authoritarian military regimes in Central America that were responsible for major human rights violations. When four US churchwomen were raped and murdered by government soldiers in El Salvador, Kirkpatrick downplayed the gravity of the crime, remarking that 'the nuns were not just nuns, they were political activists'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bringing-el-salvador-nun-killers-to-justice&lt;/ref&gt; According to Congressman Robert Torricelli, Reagan administration officials, including Kirkpatrick, deliberately suppressed information about government abuses in El Salvador: "While the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/world/how-us-actions-helped-hide-salvador-human-rights-abuses.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Leftist critics usually argued that the United States itself created a "moral equivalence" when some of its actions, such as President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support for the ''[[Contras|Contra]]'' insurgency against the [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]], put it on the same level of [[immorality]] as the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Moral equivalence has featured in debates over [[NATO expansion]], the overthrow of [[rogue states]], the [[invasion of Iraq]], and the [[War on Terror]]. Concepts of moral hierarchy have been applied to foreign policy challenges such as [[Islamic fundamentalists]], [[anti-Israel]] powers, [[Russia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[drug traffickers]], and [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[nationalists]], among others.

The term '''negative return''' is used in [[business]] or [[finance]] to describe a loss, i.e., a negative return on investment. By extension the term is also used for a project that is not worthwhile, even in a non-economic sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4056">'''Pepero Day''' is held annually on [[November 11]], and is an observance in [[South Korea]] similar to [[Valentine's Day]]. It involves the gifting or exchange of [[Pepero]] snacks, a line of [[chocolate]]-dipped [[cookie]] sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks, which are vertical that mirror the shortened date of 11/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/11/511_167943.html|title=Pepero Day: Eight things you should know|date=2014-11-11|work=koreatimes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exact origins of this day are unknown.&lt;ref name="About Day"&gt;{{cite web |last=Imatome-Yun |first=Naomi |title=November 11th is Pepero Day |url=http://koreanfood.about.com/od/holidaysandoccasions/a/November-11th-Is-Pepero-Day.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female [[middle school]] students in the [[Yeongnam]] region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=68928&amp;cid=386&amp;categoryId=386 |script-title=ko:빼빼로데이 |publisher=Parkmungak |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Pepero Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some doubt about this story.&lt;ref name="DJC Day"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gale |first=Alastair |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/11/11/on-pepero-day-a-japanese-rival-lurks/ |title=On Pepero Day, a Japanese Rival Lurks |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |subscription=yes |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks,&lt;ref name="About Day" /&gt; while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt;

The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm  at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, several [[department store]]s including [[Hyundai Department Store]], [[Shinsegae]], and [[Lotte Department Store]] were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as [[E-mart]] and [[Homeplus]] were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |title= [SS현장] '빼빼로 데이' 일부 소비자 "과소비 조장"…롯데마트 "안 사면 그만" |publisher=Sportsseoul.com |date=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232204/http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |archivedate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Pepero Day has been criticized for being a business tool of certain [[company|companies]] and for having high [[calorie]]s which is contradictory to its original meaning. Alternatives include "Garaetteok Day", which promotes Farmer’s Day through exchanges of [[garaetteok]] (sticks of white [[tteok]]).&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;

== In development ==

=== Visual ===
Previous studies have assessed the age at which humans are capable of visual perspective-taking. Various studies within the literature have drawn different conclusions.

In 1956, [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Bärbel Inhelder]] conducted a study to assess the visual perspective-taking abilities of young children which has come to be known as the [[three mountain problem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study found that by the ages of 9-10, children were able to successfully complete the three mountain problem and seemed able to understand that when someone is standing in a different location (i.e. on a different mountain top) they would have a different view. However, children ages 8 and under struggled with this task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since this classic study, a number of studies have suggested that visual perspective-taking may be possible earlier than the age of 9.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flavell|first=John H.|last2=Flavell|first2=Eleanor F.|last3=Green|first3=Frances L.|last4=Wilcox|first4=Sharon A.|title=Young children's knowledge about visual perception: Effect of observer's distance from target on perceptual clarity of target.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.16.1.10|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=10–12|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.16.1.10|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcombe|first=Nora|last2=Huttenlocher|first2=Janellen|title=Children's early ability to solve perspective-taking problems.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.635|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=635–643|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.635|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study that used a different method to assess visual perspective-taking suggested that children may be able to successfully visually perspective-take by the age of 4.5 years old.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In this study, 4.5 year old children were able to understand that someone sitting closer to a picture would have a better view of that picture. However, these researchers found that children who were 3 and 3.5 years old struggled with this task which led them to conclude that the age range of 3 to 4.5 years old could be crucial in perspective-taking development.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Additionally, developmental psychologist [[John H. Flavell]] suggested that there are two levels of visual perspective-taking that emerge as children develop.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Level 1 perspective-taking is defined as the ability to understand that someone else may see things differently and what another person can see in physical space.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, one could understand that, while an object may be obstructing their own view, from where another person is standing they can see a cat in the room. Level 2 perspective-taking, however, is defined as the understanding that another person can see things differently in physical space and how those objects are organized from that other person’s point of view.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, a person can understand that from another person’s point of view they can see a dog to the right but from their own point of view the dog is to the left.

Studies have since been done to examine when children are able to demonstrate level 1 and level 2 perspective-taking. These studies have shown that children at 24 months old&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moll|first=Henrike|last2=Tomasello|first2=Michael|date=2006-09-01|title=Level 1 perspective-taking at 24 months of age|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/026151005X55370/abstract|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=603–613|doi=10.1348/026151005x55370|issn=2044-835X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 months old&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sodian|first=Beate|last2=Thoermer|first2=Claudia|last3=Metz|first3=Ulrike|date=2007-03-01|title=Now I see it but you don't: 14-month-olds can represent another person's visual perspective|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00580.x/abstract|journal=Developmental Science|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00580.x|issn=1467-7687}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be able to engage in level 1 perspective-taking. Research also suggests that children can engage in level 2 perspective-taking as early as 2.5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moll|first=Henrike|last2=Meltzoff|first2=Andrew N.|date=2011-03-01|title=How Does It Look?

Studies have also suggested that visual perspective-taking ability improves from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Surtees|first=Andrew D. R.|last2=Apperly|first2=Ian A.|date=2012-03-01|title=Egocentrism and Automatic Perspective Taking in Children and Adults|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01730.x/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=452–460|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01730.x|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in comparing 6-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds and adults (averaging at 19 years of age) researchers found that as people’s age increased, visual perspective-taking tasks could be done with more accuracy and speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gzesh|first=Steven M.|last2=Surber|first2=Colleen F.|date=1985|title=Visual Perspective-Taking Skills in Children|jstor=1130235|journal=Child Development|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1204–1213|doi=10.2307/1130235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conceptual ===
In [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], he suggests that perspective-taking begins in the concrete operational stage (third stage) which ranges from ages 7–12.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46944889|title=The psychology of intelligence|last=1896-1980.|first=Piaget, Jean,|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415254014|location=London|oclc=46944889}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is within this stage that the idea of decentration is introduced as a cognitive ability.  Decentration was defined as the ability to take into account the way others perceive various aspects of a given situation.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

Another developmental perspective-taking theory was created by [[Robert L. Selman]] and entitled social perspective-taking theory (also known as [[Role-taking theory]]). This theory suggests that there are five developmental stages involved in perspective-taking ranging from ages 3–6 (characterized by [[egocentrism]] or an inability to think of things from another’s point of view) to teenagers and adults (where people can understand another person’s point of view and this understanding is informed by recognizing another person’s environment and culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selman|first=Robert L.|date=1971|title=Taking Another's Perspective: Role-Taking Development in Early Childhood|jstor=1127580|journal=Child Development|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1721–1734|doi=10.2307/1127580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory suggests that as humans age from childhood to adulthood their ability to perspective-take improves. Studies by Selman and colleagues suggest that children are able to perspective-take in different ways at different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selman|first=Robert L.|last2=Byrne|first2=Diane F.|date=1974|title=A Structural-Developmental Analysis of Levels of Role Taking in Middle Childhood|jstor=1127850|journal=Child Development|volume=45|issue=3|pages=803–806|doi=10.2307/1127850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies assess that children can begin to take on the viewpoint of another person considering their feelings, thoughts and attitudes as 4-years-olds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossler|first=Daniel G.|last2=Marvin|first2=Robert S.|last3=Greenberg|first3=Mark T.|title=Conceptual perspective taking in 2- to 6-year-old children.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.12.1.85|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=85–86|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.12.1.85|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain regions ==

=== Visual ===
Visual perspective-taking studies that focus on brain regions are generally performed by collecting [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) data while participants perform perspective-taking tasks. For example, a participant may be shown a picture of another person with objects around them and asked to take on the viewpoint of that person and indicate the number of objects they see (Level 1 visual perspective-taking) and if the objects are located to the right or left of the other person (level 2 visual perspective-taking).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; While the participant is completing this task they are also having an fMRI scan.

A [[meta-analysis]] that looked at existing fMRI research on visual perspective-taking as of 2013 suggested that several areas of the brain have clustered activation during these perspective-taking tasks. These areas included the left [[prefrontal cortex]], the [[precuneus]], and the left [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Studies suggest these areas of the brain are involved in decision making,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barraclough|first=Dominic J|last2=Conroy|first2=Michelle L|last3=Lee|first3=Daeyeol|date=2004|title=Prefrontal cortex and decision making in a mixed-strategy game|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nn1209|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=7|issue=4|pages=404–410|doi=10.1038/nn1209|issn=1546-1726|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; visual imagery,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavanna|first=Andrea E.|last2=Trimble|first2=Michael R.|date=2006-03-01|title=The precuneus: a review of its functional anatomy and behavioural correlates|url=http://academic.oup.com/brain/article/129/3/564/390904/The-precuneus-a-review-of-its-functional-anatomy|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=129|issue=3|pages=564–583|doi=10.1093/brain/awl004|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottwald|first=Birgit|last2=Mihajlovic|first2=Zoran|last3=Wilde|first3=Barbara|last4=Mehdorn|first4=Hubertus Maximilian|date=2003-01-01|title=Does the cerebellum contribute to specific aspects of attention?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393203000903|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=41|issue=11|pages=1452–1460|doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(03)00090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

=== Conceptual ===
Research assessing the brain regions involved in conceptual perspective-taking also suggests that multiple brain areas are potentially involved. Studies have been conducted by administering a [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scan and asking participants to engage in perspective-taking tasks. For example, in one study, participants who were all medical students were asked to consider the knowledge base someone who was not in the medical field would have on a list of medical questions.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruby|first=Perrine|last2=Decety|first2=Jean|date=2003-06-01|title=What you believe versus what you think they believe: a neuroimaging study of conceptual perspective-taking|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02673.x/abstract|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=17|issue=11|pages=2475–2480|doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02673.x|issn=1460-9568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have suggested that regions that are activated during cognitive perspective-taking include the right [[parietal lobe]] and the [[posterior cingulate cortex]] posterior cingulate cortex among others.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruby|first=Perrine|last2=Decety|first2=Jean|date=2001|title=Effect of subjective perspective taking during simulation of action: a PET investigation of agency|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nn0501_546|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=4|issue=5|pages=546–550|doi=10.1038/87510|issn=1546-1726|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature also points out that some areas seem to be involved both when people imagine themselves and when they imagine the perspective of others. For example, when participants were asked to imagine themselves engaging in an activity versus imagining another person engaging in that activity the [[precuneus]] and the [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA) were activated, suggesting visual imagery and motor movement thoughts were involved in both tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Deficits ==

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ===
Research has highlighted that it may be more difficult for children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) to perspective-take. ADHD research has shown that children with this diagnosis have shown impairments in attention and communication.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Perspective-taking research has found that children with ADHD have a harder time taking on the viewpoint of others than children who do not have ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marton|first=Imola|last2=Wiener|first2=Judith|last3=Rogers|first3=Maria|last4=Moore|first4=Chris|last5=Tannock|first5=Rosemary|date=2009-01-01|title=Empathy and Social Perspective Taking in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-008-9262-4|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=107–118|doi=10.1007/s10802-008-9262-4|issn=0091-0627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism ===
There is evidence to suggest that children with [[autism]] may be able to engage in visual perspective-taking but may have difficulty engaging in conceptual perspective-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron-Cohen|first=Simon|date=1988-09-01|title=Social and pragmatic deficits in autism: Cognitive or affective?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02212194|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=379–402|doi=10.1007/bf02212194|issn=0162-3257}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study that compared perspective-taking scores in children who had been diagnosed with autism as compared to children who did not have this diagnosis found no significant difference in scores on level 1 and level 2 visual perspective-taking. However, the study found it was much harder for autistic children to engage in conceptual perspective-taking tasks.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Some studies have been done to explore potential interventions that could help improve perspective-taking abilities in children with autism. These studies suggested that the use of video may be helpful in teaching perspective-taking skills in children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeBlanc|first=Linda A|last2=Coates|first2=Andrea M|last3=Daneshvar|first3=Sabrina|last4=Charlop-Christy|first4=Marjorie H|last5=Morris|first5=Caroline|last6=Lancaster|first6=Blake M|date=2003|title=Using video modeling and reinforcement to teach perspective-taking skills to children with autism.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=36|issue=2|pages=253–257|doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-253|issn=0021-8855|pmc=1284438|pmid=12858990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; For example, an intervention study with autistic children, found that showing the children a video of someone engaging in perspective-taking tasks and explaining their actions led to improved perspective-taking ability.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==
An abundance of literature has linked perspective-taking abilities with other behaviors. Much of this literature specifically focuses on perceptual perspective-taking (or taking on the viewpoint of another person's thoughts, feelings and attitudes).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Empathy ===
Many studies have associated perspective-taking with [[empathy]]. Psychologist Mark Davis suggested that empathy consists of multiple dimensions. To assess this, Davis developed the [[Interpersonal Reactivity Index]] (IRI).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The IRI consists of four subscales: fantasy, empathic concern, personal distress, and perspective-taking. The perspective-taking subscale asks participants to report how likely they are to engage in trying to see things from another person’s point of view.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Studies using this widely cited measure have found that perspective-taking is associated with many prosocial behaviors. One study, which assessed cross-cultural data in 63 countries using the IRI, concluded that perspective-taking and empathic concern was associated with volunteerism and agreeableness as well as self-esteem and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopik|first=William J.|last2=O’Brien|first2=Ed|last3=Konrath|first3=Sara H.|date=2017-01-01|title=Differences in Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking Across 63 Countries|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022116673910|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23–38|doi=10.1177/0022022116673910|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, research has suggested that perspective-taking leads to empathic concern.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batson|first=C. Daniel|last2=Early|first2=Shannon|last3=Salvarani|first3=Giovanni|date=2016-07-02|title=Perspective Taking: Imagining How Another Feels Versus Imaging How You Would Feel|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167297237008|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=23|issue=7|pages=751–758|doi=10.1177/0146167297237008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research further suggests that in looking at perspective-taking and empathy it is important to distinguish between two different types of perspective-taking. The research posits that there is a difference between thinking of how one would act, feel and behave if placed in someone else’s situation and thinking of the way that another person thinks, feels, and behaves in their own situation.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; The results of this research reveals that thinking of how another person behaves and feels in their own situation leads to feelings of empathy. However, thinking of how one would behave in another person’s situation leads to feelings of empathy as well as distress.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;

Research has also found that in interactions involving negotiations, taking on the perspective of another person and empathizing with them may have differential outcomes. One study found that people who engaged in perspective-taking were more effective in making a deal  with another person and finding innovative agreements that satisfied both parties as compared to those who empathized with someone else.&lt;ref name="Galinskyetal.,2008" /&gt;

=== Sympathy and caring ===
Research has revealed that perspective-taking was associated with [[sympathy]] toward others and prosocial behavior in children as young as 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaish|first=Amrisha|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|title=Sympathy through affective perspective taking and its relation to prosocial behavior in toddlers.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0014322|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=534–543|doi=10.1037/a0014322|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looking at sibling interactions found that toddlers who were older siblings were more likely to help take care of their younger siblings when they demonstrated higher perspective-taking abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Robert B.|last2=Marvin|first2=Robert S.|date=1984|title=Sibling Relations: The Role of Conceptual Perspective-Taking in the Ontogeny of Sibling Caregiving|jstor=1130002|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=4|pages=1322–1332|doi=10.2307/1130002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creativity ===
Perspective-taking has also been associated with creativity. For example, perspective-taking has been found to increase the amount of creative ideas generated in team activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoever|first=Inga J.|last2=Knippenberg|first2=Daan van|last3=Ginkel|first3=Wendy P. van|last4=Barkema|first4=Harry G.|title=Fostering team creativity: Perspective taking as key to unlocking diversity's potential.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0029159|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=97|issue=5|pages=982–996|doi=10.1037/a0029159|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that perspective-taking could lead to more creative and innovative ideas particularly in participants who were internally driven to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Bias and stereotype reduction ===
Many studies within perspective-taking literature has focused on the potential effects of perspective-taking on the perceptions of outgroup members and has found that there are many potential benefits to perspective-taking. Literature on perspective-taking and bias and stereotyping is generally done by asking participants to take the perspective of another person who is different from them in certain domains (i.e. asking young adult participants to take on the perspective of an elderly person or asking White participants to take on the perspective of a Black person as seen in a photograph or video).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These studies have shown that perspective-taking can lead to reduced stereotyping of outgroup members,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galinsky|first=Adam D.|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Gordon B.|title=Perspective-taking: Decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.708|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=78|issue=4|pages=708–724|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.708|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved attitudes towards others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vescio|first=Theresa K.|last2=Sechrist|first2=Gretchen B.|last3=Paolucci|first3=Matthew P.|date=2003-07-01|title=Perspective taking and prejudice reduction: the mediational role of empathy arousal and situational attributions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.163/abstract|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=455–472|doi=10.1002/ejsp.163|issn=1099-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased helping behavior of outgroup members. Research also suggests that perspective-taking can lead to a reduction of in-group favoritism.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, research that focused on implicit (or unconscious) biases found that perspective-taking can lead to reduced implicit bias scores (as measured by the [[Implicit-association test]]) as well as more recognition of subtle discrimination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In disagreements ===
Research has looked at the potential differences that could arise when one is having a conversation with another person whom they agree with versus having a conversation with someone with whom they disagree. This research found that participants who interacted with people with whom they disagreed had enhanced perspective-taking ability and could better remember the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tjosvold|first=Dean|last2=Johnson|first2=David W.|title=Effects of controversy on cognitive perspective taking.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/edu/69/6/679|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|language=en|volume=69|issue=6|pages=679–685|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.69.6.679|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drawbacks ===
Some researchers have suggested that there may be some drawbacks to perspective-taking. For example, studies have found that asking people to engage in perspective-taking tasks can lead to increased stereotyping of the target if the target is deemed as having more stereotypic qualities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skorinko|first=Jeanine L.|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stacey|last3=Conklin|first3=Lindsey|date=2012-04-01|title=Perspective Taking Shapes the Impact of Significant-other Representations|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15298868.2010.517986|journal=Self and Identity|volume=11|issue=2|pages=170–184|doi=10.1080/15298868.2010.517986|issn=1529-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopting stereotypic behaviors of outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galinsky|first=Adam D.|last2=Wang|first2=Cynthia S.|last3=Ku|first3=Gillian|title=Perspective-takers behave more stereotypically.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.2.404|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=95|issue=2|pages=404–419|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.2.404|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==
Although studies have been done to assess if nonhuman animals are able to successfully engage in perspective-taking the literature has not drawn consistent conclusions. Many of these studies assess perspective-taking by training animals on specific tasks or by measuring the consistency of animals to follow the eye gaze of humans. Researchers highlight that being able to successful follow another's eye gaze could indicate that the animal is aware that the human is seeing and paying attention to something that is different from what they see.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amici|first=Federica|last2=Aureli|first2=Filippo|last3=Visalberghi|first3=Elisabetta|last4=Call|first4=Josep|title=Spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) follow gaze around barriers: Evidence for perspective taking?|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0017079|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=123|issue=4|pages=368–374|doi=10.1037/a0017079|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study that assessed the perspective-taking abilities in spider monkeys and capuchin monkeys found that these primates successfully performed eye gazing tasks which led researchers to conclude that the monkeys demonstrated some ability to consider another person’s viewpoint.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, another study that utilized an eye gazing method in assessing perspective-taking found that Rhesus monkeys were unsuccessful at eye gazing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=James R.|last2=Montant|first2=Marie|last3=Schmitt|first3=Didier|date=1996-08-01|title=Rhesus monkeys fail to use gaze direction as an experimenter-given cue in an object-choice task|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0376635795000747|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=37|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/0376-6357(95)00074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest that dogs have complex social understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agnetta|first=B.|last2=Hare|first2=B.|last3=Tomasello|first3=M.|date=2000-12-01|title=Cues to food location that domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) of different ages do and do not use|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100710000070|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–112|doi=10.1007/s100710000070|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study assessed the potential for perspective-taking in dogs by telling a dog that they were not allowed to eat a treat and then placing the food in a location that the dog could reach.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These researchers found that dogs were more likely to eat the treat after being instructed not to if there was a barrier that hid the dog from the instructor. Additionally, dogs were less likely to eat the treat if the barrier was of smaller size or had a window in it. However, this study also showed that dogs struggled in other tasks that focused on the dog's own visual attention. These researchers suggest that this study provides evidence that dogs may be aware of other's visual perspectives.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">'''Phylogenetic inertia''' or phylogenetic constraint refers to the limitations on the future [[evolution]]ary pathways that have been imposed by previous [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=K|last2=McKinney|first2=F|last3=Sorenson|first3=M|date=1999|title=Phylogenetic constraint on male parental care in the dabbling ducks.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=266|pages=759–763|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0702|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525_Phylogenetic_Inertia_and_Darwin%27s_Higher_Law|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of phylogenetic inertia ==

=== Body plan ===

*[[File:Fishapod evolution.jpg|alt=Sown here is a cladogram of the best known transitional fossils. From bottom to top: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Pederpes.|thumb|229x229px|Evolution of fish to tetrapods.  The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human]]s do not have optimal structure for [[bipedalism]], because much of the human body plan originally evolved under [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] locomotion, and has since been constrained because of phylogenetic inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|last2=Lewontin|first2=R. C.|date=1979-09-21|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|issn=0962-8452|pmid=42062|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]]. The fact that they are homologous is further evidence for phylogenetic inertia; these structures have been modified over time, but they are constrained by common ancestry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Homology vertebrates-en.svg|thumb|Homologous bone structure in forelimbs of four vertebrates.|159x159px]]
* All vertebrates share a homologous eye structure that effectively have a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] in them where the [[optic nerve]] attaches to the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blind Watchmaker|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=0-393-31570-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests for phylogenetic inertia in study systems ==
There have been several studies that have been able to effectively test for phylogenetic inertia when looking into shared traits; predominantly with a comparative methods approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz-Filho|first=Jose Alexandre Felizola|last2=Sant'Ana|first2=Carlos Eduardo Ramos de|last3=Bini|first3=Luis Mauricio|date=1998-01-01|title=An Eigenvector Method for Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia|jstor=2411294|journal=Evolution|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1247–1262|doi=10.2307/2411294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pienaar|first=Jason|last2=Ilany|first2=Amiyaal|last3=Geffen|first3=Eli|last4=Yom-Tov|first4=Yoram|date=2013-05-01|title=Macroevolution of life-history traits in passerine birds: adaptation and phylogenetic inertia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12077/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=16|issue=5|pages=571–576|doi=10.1111/ele.12077|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morales|first=Eduardo|date=2000-04-01|title=Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia in Tithonia (asteraceae): A Comparative Approach|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x/abstract|journal=Evolution||volume=54|issue=2|pages=475–484|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have used comparative methods and found evidence for certain traits attributed to adaptation, and some to phylogeny; there were also numerous traits that could be attributed to both.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another study developed a new method of comparative examination that showed to be a powerful predictor of phylogenetic inertia in a variety of situations. It was called Phylogenetic [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|Eigenvector]] Regression (PVR), which runs [[Principal component analysis|principal component analyses]] between species on a pairwise [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|phylogenetic distance matrix]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another, different study, the authors described methods for measuring phylogenetic inertia, looked at effectiveness of various comparative methods, and found that different methods can reveal different aspects of drivers. [[Autoregression]] and PVR showed good results with morphological traits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In [[international relations]], the term '''smart power''' refers to the combination of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] strategies.  It is defined by the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] as "an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships, and institutions of all levels to expand one's influence and establish legitimacy of one's action."&lt;ref name="CSIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSIS Commission on Smart Power: A Smarter, More Secure America.|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/071106_csissmartpowerreport.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Nye]], former [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs]] under the [[Clinton administration]] and author of several books on smart power strategy, suggests that the most effective strategies in foreign policy today require a mix of hard and soft power resources.  Employing only hard power or only soft power in a given situation will usually prove inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavel|first=Doug|title=Joseph Nye on Smart Power|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/publications/insight/international/joseph-nye|publisher=Harvard University Kennedy School|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye utilizes the example of [[terrorism]], arguing that combatting terrorism  demands smart power strategy.  He advises that simply utilizing soft power resources to change the hearts and minds of the Taliban government would be ineffective and requires a hard power component.  In developing relationships with the mainstream Muslim world, however, soft power resources are necessary and the use of hard power would have damaging effects.

According to [[Chester A. Crocker]], smart power "involves the strategic use of diplomacy, persuasion, capacity building, and the projection of power and influence in ways that are cost-effective and have political and social legitimacy"{{spaced ndash}}essentially the engagement of both military force and all forms of diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crocker, Chester A, |author2=Hampson, Fen Osler |author3=Aall, Pamela R.  |title=Leashing the Dogs of War: Conflict Management in a Divided World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8EJHUhAk7kC |publisher= US Institute of Peace Press |year=2007 |ISBN=978-1-929223-97-8 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Nye]]'s book describing the concept of "[[soft power]]"]]

The origin of the term "smart power" is under debate and has been attributed to both [[Suzanne Nossel]] and [[Joseph Nye]].

Suzanne Nossel, Deputy to Ambassador Holbrooke at the United Nations during the Clinton administration, is credited with coining the term in an article in [[Foreign Affairs]] entitled, "Smart Power: Reclaiming Liberal Internationalism", in 2004.&lt;ref name="Nossel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nossel|first=Suzanne|title=Smart Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/59716/suzanne-nossel/smart-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article in the CNN, she has criticized the Trump administration for its "tunnel-vision" foreign policy that neglects both soft power and smart power. She writes: "..Trump seems oblivious toward the brand value of what Joseph Nye has called the 'soft power' that comes from projecting appealing aspects of American society and character abroad. He is also indifferent to my own concept of 'smart power,'or the imperative to engage a broad range of tools of statecraft, from diplomacy to aid to private sector engagement to military intervention."&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/05/opinions/trumps-worrying-foreign-policy-nossel-opinion/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Nye]], however, claims that smart power is a term he introduced in 2003 "to counter the misperception that soft power alone can produce effective foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65163/joseph-s-nye-jr/get-smart?page=1|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the term to name an alternative to the hard power-driven foreign policy of the Bush administration.  Nye notes that smart power strategy denotes the ability to combine hard and soft power depending on whether hard or soft power would be more effective in a given situation.  He states that many situations require soft power; however, in stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons program, for instance, hard power might be more effective than soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Wielding Smart Power in World Affairs|url=http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu.node/6279|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of the ''Financial Times'', "to win the peace, therefore, the US will have to show as much skill in exercising soft power as it has in using hard power to win the war."&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Smart power addresses multilateralism and enhances foreign policy.

A successful smart power narrative for the United States in the twenty-first century, Nye argues, will not obsess over power maximization or the preservation of hegemony. Rather, it will find "ways to combine resources into successful strategies in the new context of power diffusion and the 'rise of the rest.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|pages=207–208|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successful smart power strategy will provide answers to the following questions: 1) What goals or outcomes are preferred?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) What resources are available and in which contexts?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208" /&gt; 3) What are the positions and preferences of the targets of attempts at influence?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208" /&gt; 4) Which forms of power behavior are most likely to succeed?&lt;ref name="Nye Future of Power 209"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5) What is the probability of success?&lt;ref name="Nye Future of Power 209"/&gt;

Since the period of ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (1815–1914) the [[United Kingdom]] has employed a combination of influence and coercion in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sondhaus|first1=Lawrence|title=Soft power, hard power, and the Pax Americana|date=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415545331|pages=204–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujlMly6WVxIC&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term smart power emerged in the past decade, but the concept of smart power has much earlier roots in the history of the United States and is a popular notion in international relations today.

1901:  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaims: "[[Big Stick ideology|Speak softly and carry a big stick]]."

1948:  The United States initiates major peacetime soft power programs under the authority of the [[Smith–Mundt Act|Smith-Mundt Act]], including broadcasting, exchange and information world wide to combat the outreach of the [[Soviet Union]].

1991:  The end of the [[Cold War]] was marked by the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]], which fell as a result of a combination of hard and soft power.  Throughout the Cold War, hard power was used to deter Soviet aggression and soft power was used to erode faith in Communism.  Joseph Nye said: "When the Berlin Wall finally collapsed, it was destroyed not by artillery barrage but by hammers and bulldozers wielded by those who had lost faith in communism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65163/joseph-s-nye-jr/get-smart?page=1|publisher=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004:  Joseph S. Nye introduces the term "smart power" in his book, "Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics".  "Smart power is neither hard nor soft.  It is both," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics|year=2004|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article in "Foreign Affairs", analyst Suzanne Nossel uses the term "smart power".  For Nossel, "Smart power means knowing that the United States' own hand is not always its best tool: U.S. interests are furthered by enlisting others on behalf of U.S. goals."&lt;ref name="Nossel"/&gt;

2007:  In light of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] was criticized for placing too much emphasis on a hard power strategy.  To counter this hard power strategy, the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] released the "Commission on Smart Power" to introduce the concept of smart power into discussion on which principles should guide the future of U.S. foreign policy in light of 9/11 and the war in Iraq.&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;   The report identifies five critical areas of focus for the U.S.: Alliances, [[Global Development]], [[Public diplomacy|Public Diplomacy]], [[Economic integration|Economic Integration]], and Technology and Innovation.&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;   According to the report, these five goals constitute smart foreign policy and will help the United States achieve the goal of "American preeminence as an agent of good."&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;

2009: [[The Center for Strategic and International Studies]], released a second report, "Investing in a New [[Multilateralism]]", to address the concept of smart power in international releases.  This report addressed the United Nations as an instrument of U.S. smart power.  By collaborating with the UN, the U.S. can lead the way in reinvigorating multilateralism within in the international community in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing in a New Multilateralism|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090128_mendelsonforman_un_smartpower_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2009: Under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], smart power became a core principle of his foreign policy strategy.  It was popularized by [[Hillary Clinton]] during her Senate confirmation hearing on January 13, 2009 for the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;We must use what has been called smart power---the full range of tools at our disposal---diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural---picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.  With smart power, diplomacy will be the vanguard of foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|title=Clinton: Use "Smart Power" in Diplomacy|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-4718044.html|publisher=CBSNews|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Both [[Suzanne Nossel]] and [[Joseph Nye]] were supportive of Clinton's encouragement of smart power, since it would popularize the use of smart power in U.S. foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Etheridge|first=Eric|title=How Soft Power got Smart|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/how-soft-power-got-smart/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   That popularization has been accompanied by more frequent use of the term, and [[David Ignatius]] describes it as an "overused and vapid phrase meant to connote the kind of power between hard and soft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ignatius, David|title=In ‘Hard Choices,’ Hillary Clinton opens up about world leaders and what she got right|date=June 19, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-hard-choices-hillary-clinton-opens-up-about-world-leaders-and-what-she-got-right/2014/06/09/b4ecc0d2-efeb-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010:  The "First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR)" entitled, "Leading through Civilian Power", called for the implementation of a smart power strategy through civilian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review: Leading through Civilian Power|url=https://www.state.gov/s/dmr/qddr/|publisher=Department of State|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011: Obama's "2011 May Speech on the Middle East and North Africa" called for a smart power strategy, incorporating development, in addition to defense and diplomacy, as the third pillar of his foreign policy doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama's Speech on the Middle East and North Africa|url=http://www.cfr.org/middle-east/obamas-speech-middle-east-north-africa-may-2011/p25049|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary application==
===United Kingdom===
The UK government [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]] was based on a combination of hard power and soft power strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|date=November 2015|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review and its Implications|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-2015-strategic-defence-and-security-review-and-its-implications|publisher=Gresham College|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review — Motion to Take Note|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2015-12-03a.1250.0|publisher=TheyWorkForYou|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker to call for 2015 review to focus more on long-term strategy and 'smart power'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/labour-defence-review-cyberwar-threat|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart power in defence|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/2012-03-13-smart-power-in-defence|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in 2018, the National Security Review described a "fusion doctrine", that will combine resources from [[British intelligence agencies]], the [[British Armed Forces]], [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|foreign relations]] and economic considerations to defeat the UK's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43562411|title=Security boost over Russia threat and terror|date=2018-03-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/03/27/britain-launch-counter-propaganda-war-against-russia-theresa/|title=Britain to launch counter-propaganda war against Russia as Theresa May unveils 'Fusion Doctrine' defence plan|last=McCann|first=Kate|date=2018-03-27|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-28|last2=Farmer|first2=Ben|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In recent years, some scholars have sought to differentiate smart power further from soft power, while also including military posture and other tools of statecraft as part of a broad smart power philosophy. [[Christian Whiton]], a [[State Department]] official during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], described smart power in a 2013 book, ''[[Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War]]'', as: "the many financial, cultural, rhetorical, economic, espionage-related, and military actions that states can take short of general war to influence political outcomes abroad," adding, "It most crucially should involve a revival of political warfare: the non-violent push of ideas, people, facts, and events with which our adversaries would rather not contend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheDC Interview: Christian Whiton explains ‘smart power’|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/thedc-interview-christian-whiton-explains-smart-power|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiton recalled U.S. political influence activities from the [[Cold War]], including [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed programs like the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], and called for adapting these to contemporary challenges to the U.S. posed by China, Iran, and Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare of Ideas’|url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/print/articles/warfare-ideas_756460.html|publisher=The Weekly Standard|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in the application of smart power==
According to "Dealing with Today's Asymmetric Threat to U.S. and Global Security", a symposium sponsored by [[CACI]], an effective smart power strategy faces multiple challenges in transitioning from smart power as a theory to smart power in practice.  Applying smart power today requires great difficulty, since it operates in an environment of asymmetric threats, ranging from cybersecurity to terrorism.  These threats exist in a dynamic international environment, adding yet another challenge to the application of smart power strategy.  In order to effectively address asymmetric threats arising in a dynamic international environment, the symposium suggests addressing the following factors: [[rule of law]], organizational roadblocks, financing smart power, and strategic communications.&lt;ref name="DwTAT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing with Today's Asymmetric Threat to U.S. and Global Security|url=http://asymmetricthreat.net/docs/asymmetric_threat_3_paper.pdf|publisher=CACI|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of law===
{{See also|Rule of law}}
In order to implement smart power approaches on both a domestic and international level, the United States must develop a legal framework for the use of smart power capabilities.  Developing a legal foundation for smart power, however, demands a clear concept of these asymmetric threats, which is often difficult. The cyber domain, for instance, presents an extremely nebulous concept.  Hence, the challenge will be conceptualizing asymmetric threats before formulating a legal framework.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Organizational roadblocks===

The inability to promote smart power approaches because of organizational failures within agencies presents another obstacle to successful smart power implementation.  Agencies often lack either the appropriate authority or resources to employ smart power.  The only way to give smart power long-term sustainability is to address these organizational failures and promote the coordination and accessibility of hard and soft power resources.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Financing smart power===

With the ongoing financial crisis, the dire need for financial resources presents a critical obstacle to the implementation of smart power.  According to Secretary Gates, 'there is a need for a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security---diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and development."  In order to successfully implement smart power, the U.S. budget needs to be rebalanced so that non-military foreign affairs programs receive more funding.  Sacrificing defense spending will, however, be met with stalwart resistance.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Strategic communications===

"Asymmetries of perception," according to the report, are a major obstacle to strategic communications.  A long-term smart power strategy will mitigate negative perceptions by discussing the nature of these threats and making a case for action using smart power strategy.  The report states that the central theme of our strategic communications campaign should be education of our nation in our values as a democratic nation and in the nature of the threats our nation faces today.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

==United Nations as an instrument of smart power==
Of all the tools at the disposal of smart power strategists in the United States, experts suggest that the U.N. is the most critical.  The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] issued a report, ''Investing in a New Multilateralism'', in January 2009 to outline the role of the [[United Nations]] as an instrument of U.S. smart power strategy.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;   The report suggests that in an increasingly multipolar world, the UN cannot be discarded as outdated and must be regarded as an essential tool to thinking strategically about the new multilateralism that our nation faces.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;   An effective smart power strategy will align the interests of the U.S. and the UN, thereby effectively addressing threats to peace and security, climate change, global health, and humanitarian operations.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;

==Global perspectives on smart power==

===U.S.-China relations===

As announced by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in November 2011, the United States will begin to shift its attention to the Asia-Pacific region, making the strategic relationship between the U.S. and China of supreme importance in determining the future of international affairs in the region.  The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], in "Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations," offers recommendations for building a cooperative strategic relationship between the U.S. and China through smart power strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Power Relations in U.S.-China Relations|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090309_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than relying on unilateral action, the U.S. and China should combine their smart power resources to promote the global good and enhance the peace and security of the region.  The report recommends the following policy objectives: implement an aggressive engagement agenda, launch an action agenda on energy and climate, and institute a new dialogue on finance and economics.  Overall, the report suggests that U.S.-Sino relations should be pursued without the black-and-white view of China as either benign or hostile, but rather, as a partner necessary in serving the interests of the U.S. and the region while promoting the global good.

===U.S-Turkish Relations===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ObamashakeshandswithTurkishPrimeMinister.jpg|thumb|right|Obama shakes hands with Turkish Prime Minister]] --&gt;
The Obama administration continually stresses the importance of smart power strategy in relations with the Middle East and especially [[Turkey]] due to its increasing leadership role as a [[Regional power|regional soft power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fotoui|first=Eleni|title=Smart Power and U.S. Turkish Relations|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_18793-544-2-30.pdf|publisher=Expert Advisory Group (EAG)|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As not only an Islamic democratic nation but also the only Muslim member of [[NATO]], Turkey's leverage in the region could inspire other nations to follow in its footsteps. By establishing a cooperative relationship with Turkey and working to clarify misunderstandings through smart power, Turkey could eventually become the bridge between the East and the West.  A smart power approach to U.S.-Turkish relations will expand the leadership role of Turkey in the region and increases its strategic importance to NATO.

==Debate surrounding smart power==

===Transformational diplomacy versus smart power strategy===

[[Condoleezza Rice]], Bush's Secretary of State, coined the term "[[Transformational Diplomacy]]" to denote Bush's policy to promote democracy through a hard power driven strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimitrova|first=Anna|title=Obama's Foreign Policy: Between Pragmatic Realism and Smart Diplomacy|url=http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/culturaldiplomacynews/participant-papers/academy/Anna-Dimitrova-Obama's-Foreign-Policy-Between-Pragmatic-Realism-and-Smart-Diplomacy.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Transformational diplomacy" stands at odds with "smart power," which utilizes hard and soft power resources based on the situation.  The Obama administration's foreign policy was based on smart power strategy, attempting to strike a balance between defense and diplomacy.

===Smart power as an instrument of American imperialism===

In an interview with the [[Boston Globe]], interviewer Anna Mundow, questioned Joseph Nye over the criticism that smart power is the friendly face of [[American imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mundow|first=Anna|title=Wielding "Smart Power" in World Affairs|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2011/02/06/wielding_smart_power_in_world_affairs/|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By the same token, the [[Bush Doctrine|Bush doctrine]] has also been criticized for being "imperialistic," by focusing on American power over partnerships with the rest of the world.  [[Joseph Nye]] defends smart power by noting that criticism often stems from a misunderstanding of the smart power theory.  Nye himself designed the theory to apply to any nation of any size, not just the United States.  It was meant to be a more sophisticated method of thinking about power in the context of the [[Information Age|information age]] and [[post-9/11]] world.19  President Obama defined his vision for U.S. leadership as "not in the spirit of a patron but the spirit of a partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimitrova|first=Anna|title=Obama's Foreign Policy: Between Pragmatic Realism and Smart Policy?|url=http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/culturaldiplomacynews/participant-papers/academy/Anna-Dimitrova-Obama's-Foreign-Policy-Between-Pragmatic-Realism-and-Smart-Diplomacy.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffective use of smart power===

[[Ken Adelman]], in an article entitled "Not-So-Smart Power," argues that there is no correlation between U.S. aid and the ability of America to positively influence events abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adelman|first=Ken|title=Not-So-Smart Power|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/18/not_so_smart_power?page=full|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He points out that the nations who receive the most foreign aid, such as [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]], are no more in tune with American values than those who receive less or no U.S. foreign aid.  Overall, he criticizes the instruments of smart power, such as foreign aid and exchange programs, for being ineffective in achieving American national interests.

===Questioning old institutions and alliances===

In the application of smart power in U.S. strategy, Ted Galen Carpenter, author of the work ''Smart Power''', criticizes U.S. foreign policy for failing to question outdated alliances, such as NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bandow|first=Doug|title=A Prudent Foreign Policy|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0908f.asp|publisher=Freedom Daily|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carpenter articulated his disapproval of [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]], saying, "America does not need to be — and should not aspire to be — a combination [[global policeman]] and global social worker."  Rather than utilizing antiquated institutions, the U.S. should rethink certain alliances in arriving at a new vision for the future of American foreign policy.  Carpenter fears that America's domestic interests will be sacrificed in favor of global interests through smart power.  Essentially, interventionist foreign policies advocated by U.S. smart power strategies undercut domestic liberties.

'''Soil regeneration''' as a particular form of [[ecological regeneration]] within the field of [[restoration ecology]] is the act or idea of replenishing the Earth's [[soil]] with beneficial nutrients (including carbon) using natural methods. The focus—building [[soil health]]—has many benefits, both proven and theorized, including the soil [[carbon sequestration|sequestration of carbon]] in response to a growing threat of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Healthyag - Soil|url = http://www.healthyag.com/soilreg.html|website = www.healthyag.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change and the carbon cycle ==
There has been much evidence to show a significant connection between the [[carbon cycle]] and [[climate change]]. Most [[greenhouse gas]]es are primarily composed of carbon and they produce an effect where warmer air that is heated by the sun is kept from leaving the atmosphere by forming a barrier in the troposphere. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], greenhouse gasses produced by human activity have been noted as the most significant cause of global climate change since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=Edenhofer, O. |editor2=R. Pichs-Madruga |editor3=Y. Sokona |editor4=E. Farahani |editor5=S. Kadner |editor6=K. Seyboth |editor7=A. Adler |editor8=I. Baum |editor9=S. Brunner |editor10=P. Eickemeier |editor11=B. Kriemann |editor12=J. Savolainen |editor13=S. Schlömer |editor14=C. von Stechow |editor15=T. Zwickel |editor16=J.C. Minx|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|isbn=9781107654815|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=jrUNCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781107654815&amp;hl=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without human interaction, carbon is removed from and reintroduced to soil through a variety of ecosystem processes known as the [[carbon cycle]]. Humans have been significantly influencing the global carbon cycle since the [[Industrial Revolution]] through various means, such as transportation and agriculture. Through these actions, most of this carbon has moved in one direction, from the [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]]s to the [[atmosphere]]. By means of oil, gas and irresponsible farming, much of the natural carbon in the earth's [[pedosphere]] has been released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gasses.

== Regenerative agriculture ==
Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as [[monoculture]], failing to [[Crop rotation|rotate crops]] sufficiently, and intensive livestock [[grazing]].&lt;ref&gt;Sundermeier, A., Reeder, R., &amp; Lal, R. (2005). Soil Carbon Sequestration Fundamentals. Columbus, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil that is low in carbon will not support [[Plant|plant life]] and is susceptible to [[desertification]]. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. [[Agroecology]] is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes "[[permaculture]]", originally being a combination of the words "permanent" and "agriculture", which is a [[systems thinking]] approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing [[ecosystem]]s to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem. Permaculture focuses on using the land and a strong knowledge of plants, animals and natural cycles to create ecosystems that yield plentiful produce and help keep themselves healthy and productive. This can be done through intentional landscaping that would utilize as much rainfall as possible or placing nitrogen fixing plants near another crop that might need them. Agroecology also includes the ideas of [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic management]]. This approach stems from the work of [[Allan Savory]] who claims that planned grazing can improve soil health and reverse the effects of desertification.

[[Monoculture]] is a style of agriculture where only one type of crop is [[harvest]]ed in a field season after season. This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has a specific set of nutrients that it need to grow or can replace back into the soil. With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed, leaving none of those in the soil, and only certain others will be returned into the land, leaving large gaps in the richness required to maintain a healthy level of production. [[Permaculture]] and [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic management]] are two different methods that focus on increasing [[biomass]] and returning nutrient richness and diversity to the soil. The more biomass that is present in an ongoing cycle, the more carbon that can be sequestered into the soil and that can be converted into oxygen by plant matter. To accomplish these goals, permaculture encourages the idea of planting more than one crop on a piece of land at a time. Any combination of plants that are chosen to grow together in a permaculture garden or farm would help the other plants be more healthy and grow as well. In permaculture design, each individual aspect of a farm would help other aspects attain the necessary nutrients and conditions to be as plentiful as possible. This helps to regenerate soil health because the diversity of the crops and even livestock used would help maintain a balance of all necessary nutrients, including carbon. Holistic management focuses mainly onn increasing biomass through the carefully planned grazing of livestock. The idea behind holistic management is that grazing livestock can actually help improve the growing conditions for more biomass through means such as naturally fertilizing the land and tilling with hooves.

The steering ratio is the ratio of the number of degrees of turn of the steering wheel to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]], [[Tricycle|delta tricycles]] and [[Bicycle|bicycles]], the steering ratio is always 1:1, because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel. A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most [[Car|passenger cars]], the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of the steering wheel, 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.

A higher steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning, but it will be easier to turn the steering wheel. A lower steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn.

==Variable-ratio steering==
Variable-ratio steering is a system that uses different ratios on the rack in a [[rack and pinion]] steering system. At the center of the rack, the space between the teeth are smaller and the space becomes larger as the pinion moves down the rack. In the middle of the rack there is a higher ratio and the ratio becomes lower as the steering wheel is turned towards lock. This makes the steering less sensitive when the steering wheel is close to its center position and makes it harder for the driver to [[oversteer]] at high speeds. As the steering wheel is turned towards lock, the wheels begin to react more to steering input

==Steering quickener==
A steering quickener is used to modify the steering ratio of factory-installed steering system, which in turn modifies the response time and overall handling of vehicle. When a steering quickener is employed in an automobile, the driver of the automobile can turn the steering wheel a smaller degree compared to a factory-installed steering system without a steering quickener, to turn the vehicle through same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steer Quick with a Quick Steer |work=Stock Car Racing |date=April 22, 2005 |accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the steering effort needed will greatly increase. If the automobile is equipped with power steering, overloading the power steering pump can also be a concern.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Grishin, [https://racingrebel.com/subaru-steering-quickener-installation/ "Subaru Steering Quickener Installation"], ''Racing Rebel'', Retrieved 2017-07-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate definition==
Another use of the term '''steering ratio''' is for the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius based on real tire behavior.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Values less than one, where the front wheel [[Slip angle|side slip]] is greater than the rear wheel side slip, are described as [[Understeer|under-steering]]; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as [[Oversteer|over-steering]]. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as  [[Countersteering#Other_uses|counter-steering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18410">'''Sustainable Development Goal 16''' (Goal 16, SDG16 or SDG 16) - peace, justice and strong institutions - is one of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the [[United Nations]] in 2015. It "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations official website on SDGs: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16&lt;/ref&gt; The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 23 indicators. [[File:Sustainable Development Goal 16.png|thumb|SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions]]

== Background ==

=== The Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{See also|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the [[United Nations]]. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The total number of targets is 169. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[climate change]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDGs replace the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2002 to end poverty, achieve universal [[education]], [[Women's empowerment|empower women]], reduce [[child mortality]], improve [[maternal health]], combat diseases such as [[HIV]], ensure environment sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outcome Document of the UN Summit on the 2030 Agenda, ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, includes an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2017 report: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt; SDG 16 is going to be reviewed at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf|title=High-level Political Forum .:.

Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links with other SDGs ==
The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, [[media development]] enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to [[sustainability]], poverty eradication and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-freedom-expression|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html|title=Background of the Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some SDGs can be considered as cross-cutting as a whole. It is the case for [[gender equality]] and [[Africa]], which are considered a global priority for UNESCO and a "critical factor for the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/

== Achievements ==

=== UNDP ===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] is the United Nations [[International development|global development]] network who is also concerned with SDG 16 as the Programme focuses on [[Democracy|democratic governance]] and peace building.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by supporting empowering women and youth, and supporting regulatory frameworks and mechanisms and by acting as mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/conflict-prevention.html|title=Conflict prevention - UNDP|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP has provided electoral assistance in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/|title=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force - Partnership on Electoral Assistance|website=www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
UNESCO’s work on freedom of expression and the [[Safety of Journalists|safety of journalists]] contributes to Goal 16. UNESCO’s approach to media development tries to be knowledge-driven and context-sensitive. The Organization also wants to take into account the new challenges and opportunities of the media environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sdgs/ci|title=Sustainable Development Goals for Communication and Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's communication and information sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/|title=Communication and Information - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: "foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent [[violent extremism]] through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen [[Multi-stakeholder governance|governance]] systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventing violent extremism ====
Preventing [[violent extremism]] is a way to promote, in official wording, a "culture of peace and non-violence" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen [[global citizenship]], by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders - such as [[policy]]-makers, researchers and media actors -  to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and [[radicalization]] on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to promote cultural diversity to foster more fair, inclusive and peaceful societies, through the #Unite4Heritage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unite4heritage.org/|title=#Unite4Heritage – Celebrating &amp; Safeguarding Cultural Heritage - u4h|website=www.unite4heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Programmes on Heritage and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity|title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"/&gt;

==== Freedom of expression ====
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or sanction.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1859 |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |chapter=Introductory |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/ |title=On Liberty |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |publication-date=1869 |at=para. 5 |quote=Society can and does execute its own mandates ... it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

==== Freedom of information laws ====
UNESCO advocates for the creation of national legislation on [[freedom of information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safety of journalists ====
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
Safety of journalists is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to get, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. UNESCO's Freedom of Expression Section&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; and [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) develop projects to address issues of safety of journalism and impunity in the field.  [[UNESCO]] also celebrates [[World Press Freedom Day]] every year on May 3 during which the Guillermo Cano Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano|title=UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; is attributed to honor the work of an individual or an organization defending or promoting freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldpressfreedomday|title=World Press Freedom Day|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== IPDC's follow-up on SDG 16 =====
The [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] is responsible for the follow-up of the SDG 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/|title=SDG Indicators — SDG Indicators|first=United Nations Statistics|last=Division|website=unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf

https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;For international-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260892E.pdf For national-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260893E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of [[access to information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/powering-sustainable-development-access-information/about-ipdctalks|title=About the IPDCtalks|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] global report on follow-up to SDGs.

=== Organizations ===

==== Transparency International ====
The anti-corruption non-governmental organization [[Transparency International]] monitors corruption in over a hundred countries and aims to "gives voice to the victims and witnesses of corruption" and "stop the abuse of power, bribery and secret deals". The Organization launched the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: https://www.transparency.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reporters without borders (RSF) ====
[[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters without borders]] is a French "independent" non-governmental organization with consultative status at the United Nations. The NGO promotes freedom of information and safety of journalists. RSF Advocates worldwide for international and national legislation on freedom of information and protection of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en#instit|title=RSF|website=Bienvenue sur le site de Reporter sans frontières - RSF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has put together the 2018 World Press Freedom Index as a basis to analyze the state of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/rsf-index-2018-hatred-journalism-threatens-democracies|title=RSF Index 2018: Hatred of journalism threatens democracies|website=RSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Wide Web Foundation ====
The [[World Wide Web Foundation]] is an association that promotes digital equality, access to information, and the open web as a "public good and a basic right". It advocates for public policies in over a dozen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webfoundation.org/about/|title=About|website=World Wide Web Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Book of the Courtier''''' ({{lang-it|Il Cortegiano}} {{IPA-it|il korteˈdʒaːno|}}) is a [[courtesy book]] or book of manners which dealt with issues of [[etiquette]], behaviour and morals, particularly at [[Court (royal)|princely, or royal  courts]]. Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution=courtesy literature | title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year=2008
| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of the Courtier'' was written by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] over the course of many years, beginning in 1508, and was ultimately published in 1528 by the [[Aldine Press]] in [[Venice]] just before his death. An English edition was published in 1561. 

''The Book of the Courtier'' addresses the  constitution of a perfect [[courtier]], and in its last installment, a perfect lady. It takes the form of a Renaissance dialogue, a literary form that incorporated elements of drama, conversation, philosophy, and essay.  Considered the definitive account of [[Renaissance]] [[courtier|court life]], it is cited frequently, along with [[Stefano Guazzo]]'s ''The civil conversation''  of 1574 and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]'s ''Galateo '' of 1558, as an important resource on court life during the Italian Renaissance.

==Principles==
The book is organized as a series of fictional conversations that occur between the [[courtier]]s of the [[Duke of Urbino]] in 1507 (when Castiglione was in fact part of the Duke's Court). In the book, the courtier is described as having a cool mind, a good voice (with beautiful, elegant and brave words) along with proper bearing and gestures. At the same time though, the courtier is expected to have a warrior spirit, to be athletic, and have good knowledge of the humanities, [[Classics]] and [[fine art]]s.  
Over the course of four evenings, members of the court try to describe the perfect gentleman of the court.  In the process they debate the nature of nobility, humor, women, and love.

==Reception==
''The Book of the Courtier'' was one of the most widely distributed books of the 16th century, with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01516-0.html|title=The Fortunes of the Courtier|work=Penn State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1561 English translation by [[Thomas Hoby]] had a great influence on the English upper class's conception of English gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Lawrence Cunningham, John Reich|author2=John J.

==Rhetoric==
{{Undue weight section|date=November 2013}}
Of the many qualities Castiglione’s characters attribute to their perfect courtier, oratory and the manner in which the courtier presents himself while speaking is amongst the most highly discussed. Wayne Rebhorn, a Castiglione scholar, states that the courtier’s speech and behavior in general is “designed to make people marvel at him, to transform himself into a beautiful spectacle for others to contemplate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rebhorn|first=Wayne|title=Baldesar Castiglione, Thomas Wilson, and the Courtly Body of Renaissance Rhetoric|journal=Rhetorica|year=1992|volume=11|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1525/rh.1993.11.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As explained by Count Ludovico, the success of the courtier depends greatly on his reception by the audience from the first impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castiglione|first=Baldassare|title=The Book of the Courtier|year=2003|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This partly explains why the group considers the courtier's dress so vital to his success.

Castiglione's characters opine about how their courtier can impress his audience and win its approval. Similar to the Classical Roman rhetoricians [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], Castiglione stresses the importance of delivery while speaking. In Book I, the Count states that when the courtier speaks he must have a “sonorous, clear, sweet and well sounding” voice that is neither too effeminate nor too rough and be “tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes that shall give an effect of grace.” (Castiglione 1.33) This grace, or ''grazia'', becomes an important element in the courtier’s appearance to the audience. Edoardo Saccone states in his analysis of Castiglione, “''grazia'' consists of, or rather is obtained through, ''[[sprezzatura]]''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saccone|first=Eduardo|title=The Portrait of the Courtier in Castiglione|journal=Italica|year=1987|volume=64|issue=1|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Count, ''[[sprezzatura]]'' is amongst one of the most important, if not the most important, rhetorical device the courtier needs. Peter Burke describes ''sprezzatura'' in ''The Book of the Courtier'' as “nonchalance”, “careful negligence”, and “effortless and ease.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Burke| first = Peter| title = The Fortunes of the Courtier| year = 1996| publisher = The Pennsylvania State University Press| location = University Park, Pennsylvania| isbn = 0-271-01517-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal courtier is someone who “conceals art, and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought.” (31).

The Count advocates the courtier engage in ''sprezzatura'', or this “certain nonchalance”, in all the activities he participates in, especially speech. In Book I, he states, "Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to be art; nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art, for if it is discovered, it quite destroys our credit and brings us into small esteem." (Castiglione 1.26) The Count reasons that by obscuring his knowledge of letters, the courtier gives the appearance that his “orations were composed very simply” as if they sprang up from “nature and truth [rather] than from study and art.” (1.26).  This much more natural appearance, even though it is not natural by any means, is more advantageous to the courtier.

The Count contends that if the courtier wants to attain ''grazia'' and be esteemed excellent, it would be in his best interest to have this appearance of nonchalance. By failing to employ ''sprezzatura'', he destroys his opportunity for grace. By applying ''sprezzatura'' to his speech and everything else he does, the courtier appears to have ''grazia'' and impresses his audience, thereby achieving excellence and perfection. (Saccone 16).

Another feature of rhetoric which Castiglione discusses is the role of written language and style. Castiglione declined to imitate [[Boccaccio]] and write in Tuscan Italian, as was customary at the time; instead he wrote in the Italian used in his native Lombardy (he was born near [[Mantua]]): as the Count says, “certainly it would require a great deal of effort on my part if in these discussions of ours I wished to use those old Tuscan words which the Tuscans of today have discarded; and what’s more I’m sure you would all laugh at me” (Courtier 70). Here, the use of the old and outdated Tuscan language is seen as a form of excess rather than a desirable trait. Castiglione states that had he followed Tuscan usage in his book, his description of sprezzatura would appear hypocritical, in that his effort would be seen as lacking in nonchalance (Courtier 71).

Federico responds to the Count's assessment of the use of spoken language by posing the question as to what is the best language in which to write rhetoric. The Count’s response basically states that the language does not matter, but rather the style, authority, and grace of the work matters most (Courtier 71). Robert J. Graham, a Renaissance literary scholar, notes that “questions of whose language is privileged at any given historical moment are deeply implicated in matters of personal, social and cultural significance”,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in ‘The Courtier’”. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; which he states is the primary reason for Castiglione’s usage of the native vernacular. This also illustrates the Count’s response on the relativity of language in Latin. With the role of language set, Castiglione begins to describe the style and authority in which the courtier must write in order to become successful.

The Count explains, "it is right that greater pains would be taken to make what is written more polished and correct…they should be chosen from the most beautiful of those employed in speech" (Courtier 71). This is where the style of which the courtier writes encourages the persuasiveness or successfulness of a speech. The success of a written speech, in contrast to the spoken speech, hinges on the notion that "we are willing to tolerate a great deal of improper and even careless usage"&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. ''Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in The Courtier''. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; in oral rhetoric than written rhetoric. The Count explains that along with proper word usage, an ideal courtier must have a proper sense of style and flow to their words. These words must be factual yet entertaining as the Count states, “then, it is necessary to arrange what is to be said or written in its logical order, and after that to express it well in words that, if I am not mistaken, should be appropriate, carefully chosen, clear and well formed, but above all that are still in popular use" (Courtier 77). This form of emphasis on language is noted by Graham as; "Although the Count is aware that more traditional aspects of the orator (appearance, gestures, voice, etc.)…all this will be futile and of little consequence if the ideas conveyed by these words themselves are not witty or elegant to the requirements of the situation” (Graham 49).

'''''The Lexicon of Comicana''''' is a 1980 book by the American [[cartoonist]] [[Mort Walker]]. It was intended as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] look at the devices used by cartoonists. In it, Walker invented an international set of [[symbol]]s called ''symbolia'' after researching cartoons around the world. In 1964, Walker had written an article called "Let's Get Down to Grawlixes", a satirical piece for the [[National Cartoonists Society]]. He used terms such as ''grawlixes'' for his own amusement, but they soon began to catch on and acquired an unexpected validity. The ''Lexicon'' was written in response to this.

The names he invented for them sometimes appear in [[dictionary|dictionaries]], and serve as convenient terminology occasionally used by cartoonists and critics. A 2001 gallery showing of comic- and street-influenced art in [[San Francisco]], for example, was called "Plewds! Squeans! and Spurls!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stretcher.org/posts/plewds_squeams_and_spurls/ “Plewds! Squeams! and Spurls!”]; published November 29, 2001; retrieved June 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6677">'''Thomas Hency Brewer, Sr.''' (1894-1956) was an [[African-American]] [[physician]], born on November 19, 1894, in [[Saco, Alabama|Saco]], [[Alabama]], who was instrumental in the [[civil rights movement]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] during the early- to mid-20th century, before he was [[assassination|assassinated]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and Death ==

Dr. Thomas Brewer was born in Saco, Alabama, graduated from [[Selma University]] in Selma, Alabama, then from [[Meharry Medical College]] in Nashville, Tennessee, and moved to Columbus, Georgia in 1920. He became a respected physician and one of Columbus' most prominent civil rights activists, succeeding in the desegregation of the Columbus Police Department, being one of the founders of the city's [[NAACP]] chapter, and as a supporter of Primus King, among other advocacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Thomas Brewer's Office|url=http://digitalarchives.columbusstate.edu/11-dr-thomas-brewers-office|website=Columbus State University Archives|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican Party]], serving as a delegate to the GOP National Convention in Philadelphia.

On July 4, 1944, Primus E. King, an African-American registered voter, went to the [[Muscogee County]] Courthouse in Columbus to cast his vote in the Democratic Party’s primary election. He was turned away by law enforcement. Dr. Brewer encouraged and financially supported Mr. King in his lawsuit filed in federal court, styled ''King v. Chapman''.  In a landmark ruling, the court found in Mr. King's favor, deciding that the exclusion of black voters was unconstitutional.  The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed, which ended the [[State of Georgia]]'s "whites only" primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primus King and the Civil Rights Movement|url=http://georgiahistory.com/ghmi_marker_updated/primus-king-and-the-civil-rights-movement/|website=Georgia Historical Society|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Brewer shared an office building on First Street in Columbus with the F&amp;B Department store, owned by Luico Flowers.  In 1956, the two men witnessed a beating of a black man by police outside of the building. Dr. Brewer and Mr. Flowers argued about the incident: Dr. Brewer believed the police officer used excessive force and Mr. Flowers disagreed.  About a week later, on February 18, 1956, Mr. Flowers shot Dr. Brewer seven times and killed him, claiming self-defense. The grand jury believed Mr. Flowers' account of the incident and he was not charged. A year later, Mr. Flowers was found shot dead, in what authorities determined was a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Doctor's Death Causes Black Professionals to Flee|url=http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/columbus/doctors.htm|website=Freedom on Film: University of Georgia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2,500 mourners showed up for Dr. Brewer's funeral at the [[First African Baptist Church (Columbus, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]] on Fifth Avenue.

Lillian "Bunky" McClung, the daughter of the first African-American mayor of Columbus, A.J. McClung, recalled the death of Dr. Brewer in a 2015 interview with the Columbus [[Ledger-Enquirer]] newspaper: ''"Dr. Brewer had been the person behind motivating the people in this community to want more. ... I remember that day he was shot. I remember when my daddy got that phone call and he ran out the door. ... There were several dentists, several doctors in the community ... they all left when Dr Brewer was shot."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday Interview with Lillian "Bunky" McClung|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article44930010.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|agency=''Ledger-Enquirer''|date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer's wife and daughter left the city, as did Brewer's attorney and several other prominent physicians and businessmen, including Dr. W.G. McCoo, his spouse, Dr. Mary McCoo and their children, including their young daughter [[Marilyn McCoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Judith|title=Black America Series: Columbus, Georgia|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738542874|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[historical marker]] placed at the site of his assassination reads ''"Dr. Thomas H. Brewer - A [[Pike County, Alabama]] native of African-American descent, Dr. Brewer was born November 16, 1894. His office was located at 1025½ First Avenue. Brewer emerged as a chief spokesman for the civil rights of the [[Negro]] and was described by [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP as a 'fearless champion of the rights of his people.' His goal to guarantee the Negro the right to vote throughout the State of Georgia and [[Southern United States|the South]] was achieved in the Primus King case in 1945. He was a leader of the local chapter of the NAACP and worked tirelessly for racial equality. Brewer was killed by gunshots February 18, 1956 near this site."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/muscogee/dr.-thomas-h.-brewer|title=Historical Markers by County - GeorgiaInfo|website=georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Tolerance coning''' is the engineering discipline of creating a budget of all tolerances that potentially add/subtract to affect adequacy of a particular parameter.  This is particularly critical where stages of design/manufacture precede test/use.

For example, when setting a test limit for a measurement on each manufactured item of some type, to assure that no bad items are shipped, the limit must be tighter than the requirement to allow for the worst case sum of measurement inaccuracies (e.g. equipment, [[test fixture]] etc.).  The design of the item thus has to take into account not only the product requirement but also the test tolerances.  The buildup of this budget is tolerance coning.
 
Electronics engineers intuitively do tolerance coning and tend to formalise it for critical parameters.  However it is also relevant to other engineering disciplines.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Transmutation of species''' and '''transformism''' are 19th-century evolutionary ideas for the altering of one [[species]] into another that preceded [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Phillip, "Evolution", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/evolution/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French ''Transformisme'' was a term used by [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] in 1809 for his theory, and other 19th century proponents of pre-Darwinian evolutionary ideas included [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Robert Edmund Grant|Robert Grant]], and [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], the anonymous author of the book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''. Opposition in the scientific community to these early theories of evolution, led by influential scientists like the anatomists [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Richard Owen]] and the geologist [[Charles Lyell]], was intense. The debate over them was an important stage in the [[history of evolutionary thought]] and would influence the subsequent [[reaction to Darwin's theory]].

==Terminology==
Transmutation was one of the names commonly used for evolutionary ideas in the 19th century before [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' (1859).  Transmutation had previously been used as a term in alchemy to describe the transformation of base metals into gold. Other names for evolutionary ideas used in this period include ''the development hypothesis'' (one of the terms used by Darwin) and ''the theory of regular gradation'', used by [[William Chilton (printer) | William Chilton]] in the periodical press such as ''[[The Oracle of Reason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Secord, James A. 2000. ''Victorian sensation: the extraordinary publication, reception, and secret authorship of the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation''. Chicago, p311&lt;/ref&gt; ''Transformation'' is another word used quite as often as transmutation in this context. These early 19th century evolutionary ideas played an important role in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].

The proto-evolutionary thinkers of the 18th and early 19th century had to invent terms to label their ideas, but it was first [[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter]] who used the term "transmutation" to refer to species who have had biological changes through hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;http://plorenzano.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/xxi-joseph-gottlieb-kc3b6lreuter-plorenzano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology did not settle down until some time after the publication of the ''Origin of Species''. The word ''evolution'' was quite a late-comer: it can be seen in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Social Statics]]'' of 1851,&lt;ref&gt;There are three examples of the word 'evolution' in ''Social Statics'', but none in the sense that is used today in biology. See {{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=advanced_search.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918102523/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=advanced_search.php |archivedate=2010-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is at least one earlier example, but it was not in general use until about 1865-70.

==Historical development==
{{seealso|Lamarckism}}
[[Image:Vestiges dev diag.svg|thumb|right|Diagram from the 1844 book ''Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation'' by Robert Chambers shows a model of development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M).]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed a hypothesis on the transmutation of species in ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' (1809). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by [[spontaneous generation]]. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 86–94}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A radical British school of comparative anatomy (the [[Edinburgh]] school) which included the surgeon [[Robert Knox]] and the [[anatomist]] [[Robert Edmund Grant|Robert Grant]] was closely in touch with Lamarck's school of French ''Transformationism'', which contained scientists such as [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. Grant developed Lamarck's and [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s ideas of transmutation and [[evolutionism]], investigating [[homology (biology)|homology]] to prove [[common descent]]. As a young student [[Charles Darwin]] joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor [[Robert Jameson]] whose journal published an anonymous paper in 1826 praising "Mr. Lamarck" for explaining how the higher animals had "evolved" from the "simplest worms" – this was the first use of the word "evolved" in a modern sense. Jameson's course closed with lectures on the ''"Origin of the Species of Animals"''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Desmond|Moore|1994|p = 40}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 120–134}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] published his unofficial ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] anonymously published an influential and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed an ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations led to the unfolding of a preordained [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] plan woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely [[Materialism|materialistic]] than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like [[Adam Sedgwick]], and radical materialists like [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who disliked Chambers' implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. Darwin himself openly deplored the author's "poverty of intellect", and dismissed it as a "literary curiosity." However, the high profile of the public debate over ''Vestiges'', with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, and its popular success, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 134–138}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|Morus|2005|pp = 142–143}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Desmond|Moore|1994|p = 47}} &lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced some younger naturalists, including [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], to take an interest in the idea of transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to transmutation==
Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the radical materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and [[Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 5–24}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In Britain, where the philosophy of [[natural theology]] remained influential, [[William Paley]] wrote the book ''Natural Theology'' with its famous [[watchmaker analogy]], at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 103–104}} &lt;/ref&gt; Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of ''The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 37–38}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|p = 138}} &lt;/ref&gt; Although the geologist [[Charles Lyell]] opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) he criticized and dismissed Lamarck's theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for this particular habitat, but would go extinct when this habitat changed.&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"/&gt;

[[Image:Vertebrate archetype.jpg|thumb|left|This 1847 diagram by Richard Owen shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates.]]
Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with [[idealism]], such as [[Goethe]], [[Hegel]] and [[Lorenz Oken]]. Idealists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Richard Owen]] believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in [[embryology]], as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with [[Progressive creationism|progressive creation]] leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of "archetypes" in the divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as [[vertebrate]] limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and [[Gideon Mantell]], Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding ''Vestiges'', would be factors in his decision to ensure that his theory was fully supported by facts and arguments before publishing his ideas.&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|van Wyhe|2007|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transposed Letter Effect''', in psychology, tests any effect on how a word is processed when two letters within the word are switched.

The phenomenon takes place when two letters in a word (typically called a base word) switch positions to create a new string of letters that form a new, [[non-word]] (typically called a transposed letter non-word or TL non-word). It is a form of [[priming (psychology)]] because the transposed letter non-word is able to activate the lexical representation of its base word. A non-word that is created by transposing letters in a base word is significantly more effective at being a prime for that base word than would be a prime created by exchanging letters from the base word with random letters that were not originally in the base word. For example, the TL non-word 'stduent' would be a more effective prime than would be the non-word 'stobent' for the base word student.

Priming is an effect of [[implicit memory]] where exposure to a certain stimulus, event, or experience affects responding to a different stimulus. Typically, the event causes the stimulus to become more salient. The transposed letter effect can be used as a form of priming.

==Relevance==
With any priming task the purpose is to test the initial stages of processing in order to better understand more complex processing. Psychologists use transposed-letter priming to test how people comprehend word meanings. From these findings, people can begin to understand how people learn, develop and understand language. Transposed-letter priming is used in a wide array of experiments and the reasons for using this method can depend on the particular hypothesis.

==Types==

===Close Transpositions===
Switching the position of adjacent letters in the base word is a close [[wikt:transposition|transposition]]. This type of transposition creates the greatest priming effect. For example, an effective prime for the word "computer" would be the TL non-word "comptuer".

===Distant Transpositions===
Forming a prime word by switching the position of nonadjacent letters in the base word is a distant transposition. There is significantly less priming effect in a distant transposition than a close transposition, no matter how distant the two letters are from each other.

==History==
The first study to test the transposed-letter effects was Burner and O’Dowd (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bruner, J. S. &amp; O’Dowd, D.|year=1958|title=A note on the informativeness of parts of words|journal=Language and Speech|volume=1|pages=98–101|doi=10.1177/002383095800100203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their experiment did not use priming. They showed participants a word that had a two letter switched either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word and they had to determine what the English word was. They measured their response time. Bruner and O’Dowd found that the error at the beginning created the slowest response time, the end was the next slowest and the middle was the fastest. The conclusion to this data was that the beginning and the end were more important for word recognition than the middle. From there, the transposition letter effect was used to test how people process and recognize words using many tasks.

==Transposed Letter Effect in Baboons==
A study by Ziegler et al. (2013) demonstrated that baboons also show similar effects in regards to the transposed letter effect as humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ziegler J. C., Hannagan T., Dufau S., Montant M., Fagot J., Grainger J. | year = 2013 | title = Transposed-letter effects reveal orthographic processing in baboons | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1609–1611 | doi=10.1177/0956797612474322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the study was to find evidence to suggest that baboons use orthographic processing when reading. Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Graigner J. (2008). Cracking the orthographic code: An introduction. Language and Cognitive Processing, 23(1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Baboons were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The baboons were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four-letter words, previously learned by the baboons, and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). Baboons classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words.

==Theories Effected by Transposed-Letter Priming Effects==

===Theories challenged by effects of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that have been challenged by the effects shown with transposition-letter priming. These theories mainly have to do with how letters are used to process words.

Slot-based coding theory states that each letter in a word is connected to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict letter slots is the interactive activation model created by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McClelland J. L., Rumelhart D. E. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: Part 1. an account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word and the length of the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norris, D.|year=2006|title=The bayesian reader: Explaining word recognition as an optimal bayesian decision process|journal=Psychological Review|volume=113|issue=2|pages=327–357|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.327|pmid=16637764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Perea, M. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (2003). Transposed-letter confusability effects in masked form priming. In Kinoshita, S. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (Eds.) Masked Priming: The State of the Art (97-120). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with jugde) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming judge with jupfe) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume jugde is no more similar to judge than jupfe because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words were more likely to be (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrews S | year = 1996 | title = Lexical retrieval and selection processes: Effects of transposed-letter confusability | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 775–800 | doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew’s results are also inconsistent with the many slot-based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly.

The parallel distributed processing model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) also uses a portion of words but instead of letters they are a small group of letters in the same order as in the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seidenberg M. S., McClelland J. L. | year = 1989 | title = A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming (English) | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 523–568 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.523 | pmid=2798649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word “judge” would have these groupings: _ju, jud, udg, dge, ge_. This predicts that if part of two words match there will be some priming, but this model still depends on the position of the letters to some extent, so it is not compatible with results from transposed-letter priming.

===Theories supported by effect of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that are supported by the results shown by the transposed-letter effect.

The SERIOL model (sequential encoding regulated by inputs to oscillations within letter units) described by Whitney (2001) explains processing of words as five levels, or nodes: retinal level, feature level, letter level, bigram level and word level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whitney C | year = 2001 | title = How the brain encodes the order of letters in a printed word: The SERIOL model and selective literature review | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–243 | doi=10.3758/bf03196158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bigram level, the letters detected are turned into a number of pairs. For example, the word “cart” has the bigrams ca, ar, rt, ar, at and ct. The bigrams that more closely represent the location of letters in the words are given more weight. The pairs are then used to form the word. Within this model, letter location is still a factor but is not a defining feature of word processing, so the transposed-letter effect is consistent with this model.

In the SOLAR model (self-organizing lexical acquisition and recognition) described by Davis (1999) each letter is associated with its own level of activation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. J. (1999). The self-organising lexical acquisition and recognition (SOLAR) model of visual word recognition (Doctoral dissertation). University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter in the word has the highest level of activation and so on until the last word has the lowest level of activation. In this model, position does describe the level of activation for that particular letter but because the activation is successive, two letters beside each other would have a similar activation level. The SOLAR model is consistent with the results of the transposed-letter effect priming because with this effect experiments have shown priming when two adjacent letters are switched but not when two letters farther apart in the word are switched.

Transposed-letter priming was used by Christianson, Johnson and Rayner (2005) on compound words to test the role of morphemes in word processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christianson K., Johnson R. L., Rayner K. | year = 2005 | title = Letter transpositions within and across morphemes (English) | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 1327–1339 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.31.6.1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; They switched the letters either within the morphemes (for example, snowball to snowblal) or between morphemes (for example, snowball to snobwall) in the primes and found a greater priming effect within the morphemes than between. This supported the theory that morphemes are used during the processing of compound words because the priming effect was only reduced when the letters were switched over the morpheme boundary and were unable to separate into their separate parts.

'''''Verbal Behavior''''' is a 1957 book by [[psychologist]] [[B. F. Skinner]], in which he inspects [[human behavior]], describing what is traditionally called [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name="Chiesa 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mecca |last=Chiesa |title=Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science |place=Sarasota, Florida |publisher=Authors Cooperative |year=2004 |isbn= 0-9623311-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |authorlink=B.

However, he opted to remove most of the research, he says, because it made the book "unbalanced". This research was also primarily structural in nature, and owed more to Skinner's history as a college English major than it did to his later functional analysis of behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an outgrowth of a series of lectures first presented at the University of Minnesota in the early 1940s and developed further in his summer lectures at Columbia and [[William James]] lectures at Harvard in the decade before the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F.

==Functional analysis==
{{Psychology sidebar}}

This is now sometimes called the ''four-term contingency model'' with setting conditions added as a fourth term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bijou |last2=Baer |year=1978 |title=The behavior analysis of child development |publisher=Englewood-cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hill |isbn=1-878978-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=E.K. |year=1992 |title=The aim, progress, and evolution of behavior analysis  |pmc=2733403 |journal=The Behavior Analyst |volume=15 |pages=3–29 |pmid=22478111 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consists of a ''motivating operation'' (MO), ''discriminative stimulus'' (S{{sup|D}}), ''response'' (R), and ''reinforcement'' (S{{sup|rein}}).&lt;ref&gt;However, the four-term model post-dates Skinner's work—having arisen most notably in the writings of Dr. Jack Michael, and Skinner refers exclusively to the three-term model without the MO as such. Although Skinner does refer to states of ''deprivation'' and ''satiation'' which are essentially the same thing which the MO term encompasses and extends upon.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'' also introduced the [[autoclitic]] and six elementary operants: mand, tact, audience relation, echoic, textual, and intraverbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior  |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn=1-58390-021-7}} from the forward by Jack Michael, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; For Skinner, the proper object of study is ''behavior itself'', analyzed without reference to hypothetical (mental) structures, but rather with reference to the functional relationships of the behavior in the environment in which it occurs. This analysis extends [[Ernst Mach]]'s pragmatic inductive position in physics, and extends even further a disinclination towards hypothesis-making and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skinner |first=B.F. |year=1950 |title=Are Theories of Learning Necessary? |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Theories/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbal Behavior'' is divided into 5 parts with 19 chapters.&lt;ref name="Chiesa 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William |last=Baum |title=Understanding Behaviorism: Behavior, Culture, and Evolution |place=Malden, MA |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-1262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter sets the stage for this work, a functional analysis of verbal behavior. Skinner presents verbal behavior as a function of controlling consequences and stimuli, not as the product of a special inherent capacity. Neither does he ask us to be satisfied with simply describing the structure, or patterns, of behavior. Skinner deals with some alternative, traditional formulations, and moves on to his own functional position.

==General problems==
In the ascertaining of the strength of a response Skinner suggests some criteria for ''strength'' (probability): emission, energy-level, speed, repetition, but notes that these are all very limited means for inferring the strength of a response as they do not always vary together as they may come under the control of other factors. Emission is a [[yes/no]] measure, however the other three—energy-level, speed, repetition—comprise ''possible indications of relative strength''.&lt;ref name="Burrhus"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Behavior of Organisms |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |orig-year=First published 1938 |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-87411-487-4 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emission – If a response is emitted it may tend to be interpreted as having some strength. Unusual or difficult conditions would tend to lend evidence to the inference of strength. Under typical conditions it becomes a less compelling basis for inferring strength. This is an inference that is either there or not, and has no gradation of value.
* Energy-level – Unlike emission as a basis for inference, energy-level (response magnitude) provides a basis for inferring the response has a strength with a high range of varying strength. Energy level is a basis from which we can infer a high tendency to respond. An energetic and strong ''"Chomsky!"'' forms the basis for inferring the strength of the response as opposed to a weak, brief "Chomsky".&lt;ref name="Burrhus"/&gt;
* Speed – Speed is the speed of the response itself, or the latency from the time in which it could have occurred to the time in which it occurs. A response given quickly when prompted forms the basis for inferring a high strength.&lt;ref name="Burrhus"/&gt;
* Repetition – "Chomsky! Chomsky! Chomsky!" may be emitted and used as an indication of relative strength compared to the speedy and/or energetic emission of "Chomsky!". In this way repetition can be used as a way to infer strength

==Mands==
{{Main|Mand (psychology)}}
Chapter Three of Skinner's work ''Verbal Behavior'' discusses a functional relationship called the "mand". Mand is verbal behaviour under functional control of satiation or deprivation (that is, motivating operations) followed by characteristic reinforcement often specified by the response.  A mand is typically a demand, command, or request.  The mand is often said to "describe its own reinforcer" although this is not always the case, especially as Skinner's definition of verbal behaviour does not require that mands be vocal.  A loud knock at the door, may be a mand "open the door" and a servant may be called by a hand clap as much as a child might "ask for milk".

Lamarre &amp; Holland (1985) study on mands demonstrated the role of motivating operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lamarre, J. |author2=Holland, J.G. |title=The functional independence of mands and tacts |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=5–19 |date=January 1985 |pmid=16812407 |pmc=1348092 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.43-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors contrived motivating operations for objects by training behavioural chains that could not be completed without certain objects.  The participants learned to mand for these missing objects, which they had previously only been able to tact...

==Behavior under the control of verbal stimuli==

===Textual===
In Chapter Four Skinner notes forms of control by verbal stimuli. One form is textual behavior which refers to the type of behavior we might typically call reading or writing. A vocal response is controlled by a verbal stimulus that is not heard. There are two different modalities involved ("reading"). If they are the same they become "copying text" (see Jack Michael on copying text), if they are heard, then written, it becomes "taking dictation", and so on.

===Echoic===
Skinner was one of the first to seriously consider the role of imitation in language learning. He introduced this concept into his book ''Verbal Behavior'' with the concept of the echoic. It is a behavior under the functional control of a verbal stimulus. The verbal response and the verbal stimulus share what is called point to point correspondence (a formal similarity.) The speaker repeats what is said. In echoic behavior, the stimulus is auditory and response is vocal. It is often seen in early shaping behavior. For example, in learning a new language, a teacher might say "parsimonious" and then say "can you say it?" to induce an echoic response.

Winokur (1978) is one example of research about echoic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boe, R. |author2=Winokur, S. |title=A procedure for studying echoic control in verbal behavior |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=213–7 |date=September 1978 |pmid=16812100 |pmc=1332717 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.30-213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tacts==
{{Main|Tact (psychology)}}
Chapter Five of ''Verbal Behavior'' discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to "make contact with" the world, and refers to behavior that is under functional control of a non-verbal stimulus and generalized conditioned reinforcement. The controlling stimulus is nonverbal, "the whole of the physical environment". In linguistic terms, the tact might be regarded as "expressive labelling".  Tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to other listeners, as it extends the listeners contact with the environment.  In contrast, the tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to the speaker as it allows to contact tangible reinforcement.   
Tacts can undergo many extensions: generic, metaphoric, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and "guessing". It can also be involved in abstraction. Lowe, Horne, Harris &amp; Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fergus Lowe, C. |author2=Horne, P.J. |author3=Harris, F.D. |author4=Randle, V.R. |title=Naming and categorization in young children: vocal tact training |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=527–49 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12507018 |pmc=1284914 |doi=10.1901/jeab.2002.78-527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intraverbal==
Intraverbals are verbal behavior under the control of other verbal behavior. Intraverbals are often studied by the use of classic association techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moran |first=D.J. |last2= Verplanck |first2=W.S. |year=2003 |title=The Associate Technique: Assessing Intraverbal Repertoires in the Classroom |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=346–60 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-44679-002.pdf
|doi=10.1037/h0100126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiences==
Audience control is developed through long histories of reinforcement and punishment. Skinner's [[Applied behavior analysis#Discriminated operant and three-term contingency|three-term contingency]] can be used to analyze how this works: the first term, the antecedent, refers to the audience, in whose presence the verbal response (the second term) occurs. The consequences of the response are the third term, and whether or not those consequences strengthen or weaken the response will affect whether that response will occur again in the presence of that audience. Through this process, audience control, or the probability that certain responses will occur in the presence of certain audiences, develops. Skinner notes that while audience control is developed due to histories with certain audiences, we do not have to have a long history with every listener in order to effectively engage in verbal behavior in their presence (p.&amp;nbsp;176). We can respond to new audiences (new stimuli) as we would to similar audiences with whom we have a history.

===Negative audiences===
An audience that has punished certain kinds of verbal behavior is called a negative audience (p.&amp;nbsp;178): in the presence of this audience, the punished verbal behavior is less likely to occur. Skinner gives the examples of adults punishing certain verbal behavior of children, and a king punishing the verbal behavior of his subjects.

==Summary of verbal operants==
The following table&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lori |last=Frost |first2=Andy |last2=Bondy |title=A common language, Using B.F.

One must keep in mind, however, that almost all verbal behavior does not consist of these "pure" operants, but of a mixture of them.

==Use in literary analysis==
Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior drew heavily on methods of literary analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957). ''Verbal Behavior''.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant L.K. |year=2005 |title=Story Analysis and the Literary Method |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-51875-003.pdf |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=178–85 |doi=10.1037/h0100069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbal operants as a unit of analysis==
Skinner notes his categories of verbal behavior: ''mand, textual, intraverbal, tact, audience relations'', and notes how behavior might be classified. He notes that form alone is not sufficient (he uses the example of "fire!" having multiple possible relationships depending on the circumstances). Classification depends on knowing the circumstances under which the behavior is emitted. Skinner then notes that the "same response" may be emitted under different operant conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior is not specifically a matter of "teaching children how to talk", however he does speculate on this on p. 189 in terms of mands and tacts acquisition by children. I note this because Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'' is widely cited as a template for teaching children language skills although it does not appear to specifically be designed for this task.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner states:
{{quote|"Classification is not an end in itself. Even though any instance of verbal behavior can be shown to be a function of variables in one or more of these classes, there are other aspects to be treated. Such a formulation permits us to apply to verbal behavior concepts and laws which emerge from a more general analysis" (p. 187).&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Burrhus Frederick (1957), ''Verbal Behavior'', Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group, {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}} p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That is, classification alone does little to further the analysis—the functional relations controlling the operants outlined must be analyzed consistent with the general approach of a scientific analysis of behavior.

==Multiple causation==
Skinner notes in this chapter how any given response is likely to be the result of multiple variables. Secondly, that any given variable usually affects multiple responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn=1-58390-021-7 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of multiple audiences is also addressed, as each audience is, as already noted, an occasion for strong and successful responding. Combining audiences produces differing tendencies to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Normand |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Verbal Behavior: History and Future |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_3/ai_n28132971/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= 41–55 |doi=10.1037/h0099959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leigland2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leigland |first=S. |year=2007 |title=Fifty Years Later: Comments on the Further Development of a Science of Verbal Behavior |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_8/ai_n28461024/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=336–46 |doi=10.1037/h0100625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplementary stimulation==
Supplementary stimulation is a discussion to practical matters of controlling verbal behavior given the context of material which has been presented thus far. Issues of multiple control, and involving many of the elementary operants stated in previous chapters are discussed.

==New combinations of fragmentary responses==
A special case of where multiple causation comes into play creating new verbal forms is in what Skinner describes as fragmentary responses. Such combinations are typically vocal, although this may be due to different conditions of self-editing rather than any special property. Such mutations may be "nonsense" and may not further the verbal interchange in which it occurs. Freudian slips may be one special case of fragmentary responses which tend to be given reinforcement and may discourage self-editing. This phenomenon appears to be more common in children, and in adults learning a second language. Fatigue, illness and insobriety may tend to produce fragmentary responding.

==Autoclitics==
{{Main|Autoclitic}}
An autoclitic is a form of verbal behavior which modifies the functions of other forms of verbal behavior. For example, "I think it is raining" possesses the autoclitic "I think" which moderates the strength of the statement "it is raining". An example of research that involved autoclitics would be Lodhi &amp; Greer (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lodhi, S. |author2=Greer, R.D. |title=The speaker as listener |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=353–9 |date=May 1989 |pmid=16812582 |pmc=1338927 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1989.51-353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of autoclitic of critical importance in the development of language, is Skinner's concept of the autoclitic frame. Autoclitic frames help for rapid learning of new verbal behavior and the building of rules.&lt;ref name="Stemmer N 2000 23–28"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stemmer, N. |year=2000 |title=The Role of Action Names, Action Frames, and Modifiers in Listener |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_1/ai_n28820034/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=23–8 |doi=10.1037/h0099876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemmer (2000) holds: "(1) The events are responsible for the productive character of listener behavior and, via the transfer effect, of verbal behavior in general. (2) Together with ostensive events, the events are responsible for most aspects, probably even for all aspects, of early listener behavior. (3) Because ostensive learning does not require the repeated reinforcement of specific responses to vocal stimuli, the events are the main cause of the explosion in early verbal behavior."&lt;ref name="Stemmer N 2000 23–28"/&gt;
&lt;!--remove until there is something here? ===Defective self-observation===--&gt;

==Self-strengthening==
Here Skinner draws a parallel to his position on self-control and notes: "A person controls his own behavior, verbal or otherwise, as he controls the behavior of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Science and human behavior |publisher=Mcmillon |year=1953 |isbn=0-02-929040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate verbal behavior may be weak, as in forgetting a name, and in need of strengthening. It may have been inadequately learned, as in a foreign language. Repeating a formula, reciting a poem, and so on. The techniques are manipulating stimuli, changing the level of editing, the mechanical production of verbal behavior, changing motivational and emotional variables, incubation, and so on. Skinner gives an example of the use of some of these techniques provided by an author.

==Logical and scientific==
The special audience in this case is one concerned with "successful action". Special methods of [[stimulus control]] are encouraged that will allow for maximum effectiveness. Skinner notes that "graphs, models, tables" are forms of texts that allow for this kind of development. The logical and scientific community also sharpens responses to assure accuracy and avoiding distortion. Little progress in the area of science has been made from a verbal behavior perspective; however, suggestions of a research agenda have been laid out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cautilli, J.D. |author2=Skinner, L. |year=2001 |title=Toward a Functional Analysis of "Scientific" Verbal Behavior: A Preliminary Essay |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_2/ai_n28128045/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=250–2 |doi=10.1037/h0099943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.11.1423 |author=Guerin, B. |year=1992 |title=Behavior analysis and the social construction of knowledge |journal=American Psychologist |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1423–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tacting private events==
Private events are events accessible to only the speaker. Public events are events that occur outside of an organism's skin that are observed by more than one individual. A headache is an example of a private event and a car accident is an example of a public event.

The tacting of private events by an organism is shaped by the verbal community who differentially reinforce a variety of behaviors and responses to the private events that occur (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;9). For example, if a child verbally states, "a circle" when a circle is in the immediate environment, it may be a tact. If a child verbally states, "I have a toothache", she/he may be tacting a private event, whereas the stimulus is present to the speaker, but not the rest of the verbal community.

The verbal community shapes the original development and the maintenance or discontinuation of the tacts for private events (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;232). An organism responds similarly to both private stimuli and public stimuli (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;130). However, it is harder for the verbal community to shape the verbal behavior associated with private events (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;403). It may be more difficult to shape private events, but there are critical things that occur within an organism's skin that should not be excluded from our understanding of verbal behavior (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Several concerns are associated with tacting private events. Skinner (1957) acknowledged two major dilemmas. First, he acknowledges our difficulty with predicting and controlling the stimuli associated with tacting private events (p.&amp;nbsp;130). Catania (2007) describes this as the unavailability of the stimulus to the members of the verbal community (p.&amp;nbsp;253). The second problem Skinner (1957) describes is our current inability to understand how the verbal behavior associated with private events is developed (p.&amp;nbsp;131).

Skinner (1957) continues to describe four potential ways a verbal community can encourage verbal behavior with no access to the stimuli of the speaker. He suggests the most frequent method is via "a common public accompaniment". An example might be that when a kid falls and starts bleeding, the caregiver tells them statements like, "you got hurt". Another method is the "collateral response" associated with the private stimulus. An example would be when a kid comes running and is crying and holding their hands over their knee, the caregiver might make a statement like, "you got hurt". The third way is when the verbal community provides reinforcement contingent on the overt behavior and the organism generalizes that to the private event that is occurring. Skinner refers to this as "metaphorical or metonymical extension". The final method that Skinner suggests may help form our verbal behavior is when the behavior is initially at a low level and then turns into a private event (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;134). This notion can be summarized by understanding that the verbal behavior of private events can be shaped through the verbal community by extending the language of tacts (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;263).

Private events are limited and should not serve as "explanations of behavior" (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;254). Skinner (1957) continues to caution that, "the language of private events can easily distract us from the public causes of behavior" (see functions of behavior).

===Chomsky's review===
{{Main|Noam Chomsky#Contributions to psychology}}
In 1959, [[Noam Chomsky]] published an influential critique of ''Verbal Behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to [[Frederick J. Newmeyer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chomsky's review has come to be regarded as one of the foundational documents of the discipline of [[cognitive psychology]], and even after the passage of twenty-five years it is considered the most important refutation of behaviorism.  Of all his writings, it was the Skinner review which contributed most to spreading his reputation beyond the small circle of professional linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''The Politics of Linguistics'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-226-57720-1}}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky's 1959 review, amongst his other work of the period, is generally thought to have been influential in the decline of behaviorism's influence within [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html |accessdate=2008-07-09 |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624123743/http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Miller, G.A. |title=The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective |journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=141–4 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12639696 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303000299}}&lt;!--http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~geo/Miller.pdf--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has drawn fire from a number of critics, the most famous criticism being that of Kenneth MacCorquodale's 1970 paper ''On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''.&lt;ref name=MacQuorcodale&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacQuorcodale |first=Kenneth |title=A reply to Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=13 |pages=83–99 |pmc=1333660 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83 |year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacCorquodale argued that Chomsky did not possess an adequate understanding of either behavioral psychology in general, or the differences between Skinner's behaviorism and other varieties. As a consequence, he argued, Chomsky made several serious errors of logic. On account of these problems, MacCorquodale maintains that the review failed to demonstrate what it has often been cited as doing, implying that those most influenced by Chomsky's paper probably already substantially agreed with him. Chomsky's review has been further argued to misrepresent the work of Skinner and others, including by taking quotes out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adelman |first=Barry Eshkol |title=An Underdiscussed Aspect of Chomsky (1959) |journal=Anal Verbal Behav |year=2007 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=29–34 |pmc=2774611 |pmid=22477378 |doi=10.1007/bf03393044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky has maintained that the review was directed at the way Skinner's variant of behavioral psychology "was being used in Quinean empiricism and naturalization of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky (1997), {{cite web |url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/3/2.html |title=Chapter 3 |accessdate=2007-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012220023/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/3/2.html |archive-date=2007-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's influence was a point that Skinner himself conceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=David C|date=2006-01-01|title=On Chomsky's Appraisal of Skinner's Verbal Behavior: A Half Century of Misunderstanding|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=29|issue=2|pages=253–267|issn=0738-6729|pmc=2223153|pmid=22478467|doi=10.1007/bf03392134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Leigland suggests that interest in Skinner's work is growing with the next focus on a variety of complex verbal phenomena.&lt;ref name="Leigland2007"/&gt;

===Alternatives to Skinner's behavior analysis===
There is also now an alternative to Skinner's account within behavior analysis, [[relational frame theory]], and authors in that area have developed a number of behavior analytic objections to Skinner's specific approach. There is some controversy regarding RFT's status in regard to behavior analysis. Its founder Steven Hayes regards it as an extension of [[operant conditioning]] principles that is consistent with Skinner's analysis but goes beyond it (personal communication{{Clarify|date=December 2008|reason=to whom?, when?}}).

Others feel that it is consistent with behavior analysis but involves emergent principles '''not''' found in conventional operant conditioning. Finally, there are those who feel that it is simply another form of cognitive behaviorism, rather than radical behaviorism.

==Research and theory==
[[Functional analytic psychotherapy]] is one application of Skinner's model of verbal behavior to typically developing adult human populations in non-laboratory (clinical) settings.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg &amp; Tsai 1991 Functional Analytic Psychotherapy&lt;/ref&gt; As such this approach represents an attempt to empirically validate [[applied behavior analysis]] and verbal behavior for problems such as depression and other common clinical problems.

Current research in verbal behavior is published in ''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abainternational.org/TAVB.asp |title=Journals of the Association for Behavior Analysis |publisher=Abainternational.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306110601/http://www.abainternational.org/TAVB.asp |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (TAVB), and other Behavior Analytic journals such as ''The [[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) and the ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'' (JABA). Also research is presented at poster sessions and conferences, such as at regional Behavior Analysis conventions&lt;ref&gt;see the California Association for Behavior Analysis (CalABA) for example&lt;/ref&gt; or Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abainternational.org |title=Association for Behavior Analysis International |publisher=Abainternational.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; conventions nationally or internationally. There is also a Verbal Behavior Special Interest Group (SIG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psyc.csustan.edu/verbalbehavior/ |title=Verbal Behavior-Special Interest Group |publisher=Psyc.csustan.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128031246/http://psyc.csustan.edu/verbalbehavior/ |archive-date=2012-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA) which has a mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;http://lists.csustan.edu/mailman/listinfo/verbalbeh-l&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Cautilli, Copyright,2009-Website designed and maintained by BAO Journals |url=http://www.baojournal.com/ |title=See Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention |publisher=Baojournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Cautilli, Copyright,2009-Website designed and maintained by BAO Journals |url=http://www.baojournal.com/ |title=See Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |publisher=Baojournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; both publish clinical articles on interventions based on verbal behavior.

Skinner has argued that his account of verbal behavior might have a strong evolutionary parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Skinner, B.F. |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=115–22 |date=January 1986 |pmid=16812440 |pmc=1348216 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1986.45-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Skinner's essay, ''Selection by Consequences'' he argued that operant conditioning was a part of a three-level process involving genetic evolution, cultural evolution and operant conditioning. All three processes, he argued, were examples of parallel processes of selection by consequences. David L. Hull, Rodney E. Langman and Sigrid S. Glenn have developed this parallel in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hull |first=David |last2=Langman |first2=Rodney E. |last3=Glenn |first3=Sigrid S. |year=2001 |title=A general account of selection: Biology, immunology, and behavior |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |pmid=11682800 |issue=3 |pages=511–28 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=88687 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0156416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic continues to be a focus for behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |year=2006 |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior in Children |journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=1 |pages=111–50 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_1/ai_n28461334/ |doi=10.1037/h0100194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Hantula |first2=D.A. |year=2004 |title=Defining The Verbal Specialist: An Adaptive-Evolutionary View of Deception and Counter-Control |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=204–14 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_2/ai_n28128042/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |doi=10.1037/h0100032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour analysists have been working on developing ideas based on Verbal Behaviour for fifty years, and despite this, experience difficulty explaining generative verbal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chase | first1= PN |last2= Ellenwood |first2= DW| last3= Madden | first3= G |title=A behavior analytic analogue of learning to use synonyms, syntax, and parts of speech |journal=Anal Verbal Behav |volume=24 |issue= |pages=31–54 |year=2008 |pmid=22477402 |pmc=2779919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yunnan lar gibbon''' (''Hylobates lar yunnanensis''), also known as the '''Yunnan white-handed gibbon''', is a [[subspecies]] of the [[lar gibbon]], a [[primate]] in the [[gibbon]] family, Hylobatidae. This [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] subspecies is thought to be [[extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=University of Zurich|date=2008-05-15|url=http://www.mediadesk.unizh.ch/mitteilung.php?text_id=294&amp;grp=aktuell|title=Weisshandgibbons in China ausgestorben|accessdate= 2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grueter2009&gt;Grueter et al.

==Taxonomy==
This animal from [[Yunnan]] is listed as a distinct subspecies of the lar gibbon in recent taxonomic articles.&lt;ref name=Grueter2009/&gt; However, there is still debate about the validity of this classification.&lt;ref name=Brandon-Jones2004&gt;Brandon-Jones, D., Eudey, A. A., Geissmann, T., Groves, C. P., Melnick, D. J., Morales, J. C., et al. (2004). Asian primate classification.

Status reassessment of the gibbons: results of the Asian Primate Red List Workshop 2006. Gibbon Journal, 3, 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
This subspecies is distinguished from the other lar gibbon subspecies by its longer dorsal hair, shorter light hair-base, and red-brown or dark-brown [[pubic hair]].&lt;ref name=Grueter2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaWang1986&gt;Ma, S., &amp; Wang, Y.

==Status==
The Nangunhe Nature Reserve in Southwest Yunnan has been the last stronghold of the Yunnan lar gibbon.&lt;ref name=Grueter2009/&gt; During a survey from 4 to 18 November 2007, no evidence of the survival of the Yunnan lar gibbon could be found and the scientists of this survey tentatively concluded the lar gibbon has become extinct in China,&lt;ref name=Grueter2009/&gt; and the Yunnan subspecies globally. The 2008 [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] has listed this subspecies as [[data deficient]] "as its taxonomic and geographic limits are not well defined, but population sizes are by all accounts critical, and the remaining populations are near extinction."&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;
