AIDGAP is an [[acronym]] for Aid to Identification in Difficult Groups of Animals and Plants.

The '''AIDGAP series''' is a set of books published by the [[Field Studies Council]]. They are intended to enable students and interested non-specialists to identify groups of taxa in Britain which are not covered by standard [[field guides]]. In general, they are less demanding in level than the [[Synopses of the British Fauna]].

All AIDGAP guides are initially produced as test versions, which are circulated widely to students, teaching staff and environmental professionals, with the feedback incorporated into the final published versions. In many cases the AIDGAP volume is the only non-technical work covering the group of taxa in question.

== History of the series ==

The [[Field Studies Council]] recognised the widespread need for identification guides soon after its inception, and has since established a long tradition of publishing such material. Many of these were written by teaching staff writing their own keys to fill obvious gaps in the available literature (see for example [http://fsj.field-studies-council.org/media/344765/vol1.1_4.pdf A key to the land snails of the Flatford area, Suffolk (1959)]). However, it became increasingly apparent that a change in approach was needed. Too few guides were available which were usable by those with little previous experience. Many groups of plants and animals appeared to be neglected.

The FSC initiated the AIDGAP project in 1976, with input from an advisory panel which included a range of organisations such as the [[Linnean Society]], teachers in secondary education and professional illustrators. The two main objectives adopted by the panel were first to identify those groups of organisms regarded as 'difficult' due to a lack of a suitable key, and second to investigate ways of alleviating the difficulties of identification for each group. The panel also decided to incorporate a 'testing' stage during which the identification guides could be revised and improved.

In practice today, AIDGAP guides are produced as 'test versions', which are then circulated to at least 100 volunteer 'testers', drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. Test versions are available for [http://www.field-studies-council.org/publications/aidgap-testers.aspx free download from the AIDGAP web pages]. Feedback from the testers is passed anonymously to the author, then used to inform the production of the finished AIDGAP guide.

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Monumental axis.jpg|thumb| Design of [[Brasília]] – influenced by The Athens Charter]]
The '''Athens Charter''' ({{lang-fr|Charte d'Athènes}}) was a 1933 document about [[urban planning]] published by the Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The work was based upon Le Corbusier’s ''[[Ville Radieuse]]'' (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) in the early 1930s.

The Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for [[Athens]] from [[Marseilles]]. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: "Architects' Congress."

The Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II.

==Background==

Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the [[Ville Contemporaine]] in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform.

Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in [[Brussels]] in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=118}}

==The Functional City==

The concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in [[Zürich]] in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Siegfried Giedion]], Rudolf Steiger and [[Werner M. Moser]] discussed with [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in [[Moscow]] in 1933.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=59}} The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=25}}

Van Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=60}}

At a special congress meeting in [[Berlin]] later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of [[Amsterdam]]. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp=61-63}}

In 1932 Le Corbusier's [[Palace of the Soviets]] competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp71-72}}

==CIAM 4==

The fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=121}}

The national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Zürich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}}

On arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}} The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles.

During meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=85}} Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: ''observations'' and ''resolutions''.

==The Athens Charter==
[[File:Highpoint detail.jpg|thumb|Highpoint 1 by Berthold Lubetkin]]
The ''observations'' taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=173}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks.

-Mumford, 2000, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions.

The ''observations'' formed the basis of [[Josep Lluís Sert|Josep Lluís Sert's]] book ''Can our cities survive?'' and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's ''Athens Charter'' published in 1943. The ''resolutions'' formed part of Le Corbusier's book ''The Radiant City'' published in 1935.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=90}}

The text of the ''Athens Charter'' as published became an extension of the content of ''The Radiant City''{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=208}} and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original ''observations''. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the ''observations'' that were founded before on concrete references.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=156}} Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiv.gta.arch.ethz.ch/research/ciam-4-the-functional-city|title=Research Project — CIAM 4. The Functional City — gta Archives — Institute gta — ETH Zurich|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-war influence==
[[File:Rotterdam van nelle fabriek.jpg|thumb|Van Nelle Factory, Netherlands]]
The CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=77}}

After ''The Radiant City'' was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=91}}

In the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the [[Van Nelle Factory|Van Nelle factory]] designed in part by [[Mart Stam]] that was to have formed a larger part of a ''Functional City'' design.

CIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential [[MARS Group]] from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and his practice, the [[Tecton Group]] completed  [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]] in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings.{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=94}}

In 1937 with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities.

==Post-war influence==

The ''Athens Charter'' had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=120}} However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the ''Charter'' with a different ''Charter of Habitat''.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=268}}

===France===
[[File:Corbusierhaus B-Westend 06-2017.jpg|thumb|The Unité d'Habitation in Marseille]]
In 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in [[La Rochelle]] and St Dié. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the ''Charter'', but as part of the project he proposed eight [[Unité d'Habitation]] flanked by a civic centre.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=163}} Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unités resulted in one being built. In line with the ''Charter'', the Unité was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1999}} It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=172}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Alton Estate Roehampton London.jpg|thumb|High rises part of the Alton Estate]]
[[File:Parkhill2.jpg|thumb|Parkhill Estate, Sheffield]]
The 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for [[Local government|Local Authorities]] to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer [[James Maude Richards|J M Richards]] praised Le Corbusier's Unité for "putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=8-10}}

Between 1952 and 1958 [[London County Council]] built the [[Alton Estate|Alton East]] and Alton West high-rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been [[Listed building|listed]].{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=147-149}}

In Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill Estate]]. The product of an entire [[slum clearance]], three times the size of the Unité, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and [[milk float]]s.{{sfnp|Banham|1978|pp=141-143}} Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. [[Harold Macmillan]] said it would "draw the admiration of the world".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=13}}

In Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The ''Functional City'' prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the [[Gorbals|Hutchesontown Gorbals]] area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect [[Robert Matthew]] designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns.{{sfnp|MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie|1999|pp=105-108}}

The [[Golden Lane Estate|Golden Lane]] London, was designed by [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unité it has a terrace on the roof.

The Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the ''Functional City'', renaming them ''House'', ''Street'', ''District'' and ''City''. In the Golden Lane development the ''House'' became the family unit, the ''Street'' was an elevated access deck but the ''District'' and ''City'' lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book "Urban Structuring".

===The Americas===
[[File:Esplanadabsb12.jpg|thumb|Ministers Esplanade in Brasília]]
[[Lúcio Costa|Lúcio Costa's]] conception of the plan for [[Brasília]] saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=226}}

In a variation of the ''Functional City'', Sert designed married-student housing for [[Harvard University]] in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=292}}

===The rest of the world===

In Japan in 1957, [[Kunio Maekawa]] designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unité. Meanwhile, In [[Tel Aviv]] in 1963 CIAM member [[Jacob B. Bakema]] designed a ''Functional City'' proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme.

==Criticism==
[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|[[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri]]
The [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the ''Functional City''. It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. [[Charles Jencks]] proclaimed that the death of [[Modern Architecture]] was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite.{{sfnp|Jencks|1978|p=9}}

Architectural critic [[Reyner Banham]] was concerned that the supposed universality of the ''Charter'' concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing.{{sfnp|Curtis|1991|p=208}}

In planning terms the ''Charter'' had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=288}}

Even by 1954 during the [[Aix-en-Provence]] meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of [[Team 10|Team X]] at the [[Dubrovnik]] meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=287}}

In the case of Brasília, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban [[utopia]] became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=228}} In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a [[Kafkaesque]] Nightmare with an [[Orwellian]] environment.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=247}}

To reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The imitations of the Unité usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous variations?

==Recent history==
In 2003 the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] wrote a new version of the Charter.

==Trivia==

[[J. G. Ballard|J. G. Ballard's]] book [[High Rise (novel)|''High Rise'']] is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.

'''Behavioral engineering''' is intended to identify issues associated with the interface of [[technology]] and the human operators in a system and to generate recommended design practices that consider the strengths and limitations of the human operators.
{{quote|"The behavior of the individual has been shaped according to revelations of 'good conduct' never as the result of experimental study."|[[B.F Skinner]]|''"[[Walden Two]]"''}}

Watson wrote in 1924 "Behaviorism ... holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior of the human being. Behaviorism claims that consciousness is neither a definite nor a usable concept."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1924) ''Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is often used in organizational behavior management, which is [[behavior analysis]] applied to organizations and behavioral community psychology.

The '''BioWall''' is a bio-inspired computing surface made of several thousand electronic modules which can be seen as artificial molecules. Each of these modules contains a programmable electronic circuit, a [[touch sensor]] and a display composed of 64 [[LED]]s (Light-emitting diodes). As a result, each module enables the visitor to communicate with the surface by touching it with his finger, calculates its new status and indicates it immediately on a coloured display.

==Overview==
The BioWall was developed in the Logic Systems Laboratory ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/ LSL]) of the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de [[Lausanne]] ([[EPFL]]), [[Switzerland]]. Its construction has been sponsored by Jacqueline Reuge, owner of the Villa Reuge Museum in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]] ([[Vaud|VD]]). Two versions of the BioWall have been realized, in which several thousand [[FPGA]]s (''Spartan XCS10XL'' of [[Xilinx]]) constitute the core of as many modules, locally exchanging information with their nearest neighbours. The interaction with the FPGA is performed through a touch sensitive membrane and each FPGA communicates its state to a 64 coloured [[LED]] array.

The main goal of this academic project is the study of the hardware implementation of bio-inspired concepts such as self-repair, evolution, self-replication, learning... following the three main axes defined in the POEtic model:
* Phylogenetic axis (P axis), inspired by the evolution of biological species
* Ontogenetic axis (O axis), inspired by the development and growth of multicellular organisms
* Epigenetic axis (E axis), inspired by the adaptation of individuals to the environment
Among these three research axes, the main effort of the LSL has been focused to the ontogenetic axis through the Embryonics Project, which aims at drawing inspiration from the development of multicellular living organisms in order to obtain in [[digital hardware]] some of their original features, and notably growth and fault tolerance.

==BioWatch==

[[Image:BioWatch.jpg|thumb|right|The BioWatch]]

An artificial organism endowed with all of the features of an [[Embryonics Project#Embryonics machines|embryonic machine]] was implemented in the BioWall. The BioWatch, which counts hours, minutes, and seconds, is used to demonstrate the growth and self-repair capabilities of the BioWall.

Following the three levels of complexity defined in the [[Embryonics Project]], the BioWatch has been hierarchically designed: The entire watch can be seen as an organism composed of six cells, each of which is dedicated to the calculation of one digit: units and tens of seconds, minutes and hours. Each of these cells is itself decomposed in smaller identical units, i.e. the modules of the BioWall, that could be seen as the basic molecules in a real organism.

Self-repair is possible by including in the BioWatch spare molecules; when a FPGA, i.e. a molecule, becomes faulty, one of the spare molecules can take over its functionality and enables the BioWatch to still display the right time. When a whole cell, counting a specific digit, is overwhelmed by faulty molecules, it dies, but the spare space is automatically configured in order to take over the functionality of the dead cell and to replicate it. As a result, the full watch is then able to tolerate a large amount of faults inside its hardware, and nevertheless can still display the right time.

==Other applications==

The BioWall is composed of an array of small, locally connected elements and as a result is also an ideal platform to prototype [http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/ApplicationsE.html  many different kinds] of two-dimensional cellular systems and bio-inspired systems, such as:

* [[John Horton Conway|Conway]]'s [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/LifeE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* Self-replicating Loops ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/LoopsE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Alan Turing|Turing]] [[Artificial Neural Networks]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/TuringE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Von Neumann]]'s [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Universal Constructor]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/UConstE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Stephen Wolfram|Wolfram]]'s [[Cellular Automata]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/WolframE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* Firing Squad Cellular Automaton ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/SquadE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Sequence alignment|DNA Sequence Comparison]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/SequenceE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])

Although the BioWall's size and structure impose a certain number of limitations (e.g. clock speed of the system), its complete programmability provides an outstanding versatility and the visual and interactive component of the system are invaluable tools both for the dissemination of ideas and for the verification of research concepts that are often limited to software simulations.

A BioWall with 2000 molecules is now in the Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Electronics, [[University of York]] (UK). Another BioWall with 2000 molecules resides in a permanent exhibition in the Ecole polytechnique fédérale Lausanne (EPFL) and can be seen operating live with the following [http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/Camera/CameraE/CameraE.html Webcam], from Monday to Friday between 8:00 and 19:00 GMT+1.

In the field of [[electronics]], a  '''bootstrap'''  circuit is one where part of the output of an amplifier stage is applied to the input, so as to alter the input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the amplifier. When applied deliberately, the intention is usually to increase rather than decrease the impedance.  &lt;ref&gt; ''IEEE Standard 100  Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition'', IEEE Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}} page 123 &lt;/ref&gt; Generally, any technique where part of the output of a system is used at startup is described as bootstrapping.

==Input impedance==
[[File:Emitter follower.png|thumb|400px|Bootstrap capacitors C1 and C2 in a BJT emitter follower circuit]]
In [[analog circuit]] designs, a bootstrap circuit is an arrangement of components deliberately intended to alter the [[input impedance]] of a circuit. Usually it is intended to increase the impedance,  by using a small amount of positive [[feedback]], usually over two stages. This was often necessary in the early days of [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] [[transistor]]s, which inherently have quite a low input impedance. Because the feedback is positive, such circuits can suffer from poor stability and noise performance compared to ones that don't bootstrap.

''Negative'' feedback may alternatively be used to bootstrap an input impedance, causing the apparent impedance to be reduced. This is seldom done deliberately, however, and is normally an unwanted result of a particular circuit design. A well-known example of this is the [[Miller effect]], in which an unavoidable feedback capacitance appears increased (i.e. its impedance appears reduced) by negative feedback.  One popular case where this ''is'' done deliberately is the [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|Miller compensation]] technique for providing a low-frequency pole inside an integrated circuit.  To minimize the size of the necessary capacitor, it is placed between the input and an output which swings in the opposite direction.  This bootstrapping makes it act like a larger capacitor to ground.

==Driving MOS transistors==
A N-[[MOSFET]]/[[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]] needs a significantly positive charge (''V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) applied to the gate in order to turn on. Using only N-channel MOSFET/IGBT devices is a common cost reduction method due largely to [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] size reduction&lt;!-- Source needed citing cost reduction from use of nMOS over pMOS devices. --&gt; (there are other benefits as well). However, using nMOS devices in place of pMOS devices means that a voltage higher than the power rail supply (V+) is needed in order to bias the transistor into linear operation (minimal current limiting) and thus avoid significant heat loss.

A bootstrap capacitor is connected from the supply rail (V+) to the output voltage. Usually the source terminal of the N-[[MOSFET]] is connected to the [[cathode]] of a recirculation [[diode]] allowing for efficient management of stored energy in the typically inductive load (See [[Flyback diode]]). Due to the charge storage characteristics of a capacitor, the bootstrap voltage will rise above (V+) providing the needed gate drive voltage.

A [[MOSFET]]/[[IGBT]] is a voltage-controlled device which, in theory, will not have any gate current. This makes it possible to utilize the charge inside the capacitor for control purposes. However, eventually the capacitor will lose its charge due to parasitic gate current and non-ideal (i.e. finite) internal resistance, so this scheme is only used where there is a steady pulse present. This is because the pulsing action allows for the capacitor to discharge (at least partially if not completely). Most control schemes that use a bootstrap capacitor force the high side driver (N-MOSFET) off for a minimum time to allow for the capacitor to refill. This means that the [[duty cycle]] will always need to be less than 100% to accommodate for the parasitic discharge unless the leakage is accommodated for in another manner.

==Switch-mode power supplies==
In [[switch mode power supplies|switch-mode power supplies]], the regulation circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance can be used to trickle-charge the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit. &lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mack ''Demystifying switching power supplies'' Newnes, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7506-7445-8}},  page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Output swing==
AC amplifiers can use bootstrapping to increase output swing.  A capacitor (usually referred as ''bootstrap capacitor'') is connected from the output of the amplifier to the [[bias circuit]], providing bias voltages that exceed the power supply voltage.  Emitter followers can provide rail-to-rail output in this way, which is a common technique in class AB audio amplifiers.&lt;br /&gt;

==Digital integrated circuits==
Within an integrated circuit a bootstrap method is used to allow internal address and clock distribution lines to have an increased voltage swing.  The bootstrap circuit uses a coupling capacitor, formed from the gate/source capacitance of a transistor, to drive a signal line to slightly greater than the supply voltage. &lt;ref&gt; William J. Dally, John W. Poulton, ''Digital systems engineering'', Cambridge University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-59292-5}} pages 190-191 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buttplug.png|thumb|right|Computer drawing of a butt plug]]

A '''butt plug''' is a [[sex toy]] that is designed to be inserted into the [[rectum]] for [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tristan|last=Taormino|authorlink=Tristan Taormino|year=1997|title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women|publisher=[[Cleis Press]]|isbn=1-57344-028-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways, they are similar to a [[dildo]], but they tend to be shorter, and have a flanged end to prevent the device from being lost inside the rectum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men and Women|author=Jack Morin|year=2000|publisher=Down There Press|isbn=0-940208-20-2|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Butt plugs were originally designed for therapeutic uses and later marketed with terms such as [[Dr. Young's Ideal Rectal Dilators]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kravetz MD, [http://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v96/n9/full/ajg2001680a.html Rectal Dilators].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==
Unlike the [[vagina]], which is closed off by the [[cervix]], the [[rectum]] leads to the [[sigmoid colon]]. Objects that are inserted into the rectum can therefore potentially travel up into the [[bowel]]: the flared end on a butt plug exists to prevent this. Some dildos lack a flared end, and thus it is ill-advised to use such dildos anally since they may get stuck; [[rectal foreign body|rectal foreign bodies]] may require medical extraction.

In addition, the lower [[bowel]] above the [[rectum]] is easily perforated. For this reason, butt plugs tend to be shorter than dildos, and their marked size generally indicates the circumference of the device rather than the length. They must also be very smooth to avoid damaging the rectum or bowel. In order to get them into the rectum, they most commonly have a general profile of a round-ended cone which then narrows to a "waist" which locates itself at the anal sphincter, with the flared part outside the body, preventing the butt plug from slipping further into the body. The sphincter muscle will hold the plug in place by the waist, preventing the plug from slipping out unintentionally.

As with other activities involving anal penetration, such as [[anal sex]], large amounts of [[sexual lubricant]] and a slow gentle approach are needed to insert or remove a butt plug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morin, Jack|title=Anal Pleasure and Health|edition=3rd|publisher=Down There Press|year=1998|isbn=0-940208-20-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butt plugs are sometimes covered by [[condom]]s for hygiene and to allow for the easy disposal of any [[feces]] with which they may come into contact. Nevertheless, they should not be shared with other people, due to the risk of [[blood-borne disease]]s, including [[HIV]], that can arise from the transfer of body fluids from one person to another.

==Designs==
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|thumb|Two butt plugs]]
Butt plugs come in a variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. Some are designed to look like [[Human penis|penises]], while some are ribbed or wavy. The majority, however, are shaped as shown in the picture above, having a thin tip which is wider in the middle, a notch to hold it in place once it is inserted, and a flared base to prevent complete insertion into the rectum. Some plugs are designed (long, flexible and curved) to penetrate the [[sigmoid colon]].

Butt plugs are made of a variety of materials, the most common being [[latex]]. Other materials used include [[silicone]], [[neoprene]], [[wood]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and many other materials. Silicone is a particularly good material, as it can be [[disinfected]] in boiling water.

There are butt plugs that "ejaculate" by squirting water or other viscous fluids into the rectum. There are also vibrating butt plugs, and butt plugs that can inflate and expand. Some butt plugs are specifically designed for men and [[Prostate massage|stimulate the prostate]]. Other butt plugs are manufactured with long hair or simulated animal tails attached to the base for use in [[human pony]] play or other animal fantasy role play. Butt plugs are also available that incorporate electro-stimulation. Butt plugs can be moved in or out for pleasure; for this type of activity ribbed butt plugs can increase pleasure. They can also be worn continuously (or be lockable) for long periods of time.

===Fetish plugs===
Fetish plugs are butt plugs that are designed in a way to be unusual, exciting, or unique in some way. A fetish plug is called such because it caters to [[sexual fetish]]es.

[[File:Tailplug.jpg|thumb|Butt plug with faux animal tail]]
A common type of fetish plugs is the butt plug with faux animal tail. The animal tail, usually made with fake fur, is attached to the non-insertable end of the plug so that when worn or inserted, the impression is given that the wearer has an animal's tail. Some "tail" butt plugs popular in human puppy play are molded from [[medical grade silicone]] allowing a simulated tail "wag".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehappypup.com/square-peg-puppy-tails/ Human Pup Play Tails] Retrieved October 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
{{see also|Prostate massage#Risks}}

Sex toys that are used in the anus can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this from occurring, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Regina Nuzzo |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/ |title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety |publisher=Scientific American |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the flared flange is not a foolproof method of preventing the plug from entering the rectum completely with the inability to retrieve it. This is uncomfortable and may require medical intervention. Butt plugs of excess diameter can, especially when inserted too rapidly and/or too forcefully, lead to sphincter tear, detachment or other rectal failure. [[Kegel exercise]]s can help maintain normal, healthy sphincter function. When inserting a butt plug, one should be gentle, use plenty of lubrication, start with smaller sizes, and exercise patience. While medical data is sparse, some recommend not leaving a butt plug inserted for longer than two to three hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehealthybear.com/butt-plug-guide/ Butt Plug Safety Guide] Retrieved October 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" There are no good research studies that evaluate the short or long-term effects of using butt plugs... short-term use probably is not much different than bowel movements, anal sex, or medical procedures. Long-term use, however, probably is." Mark P. Behar, PA-C quoted in ''Shepard Express'' "More on Wearing Anal Plugs Long Term"  http://shepherdexpress.com/article-permalink-12522.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian psychology''' is a merger of [[theology]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=tbc&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Christian Psychology?|url=https://www.thebereancall.org/content/tbc-extra-32|website=The Berean Call|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an aspect of psychology adhering to the religion of [[Christianity]] and its teachings of Jesus Christ to explain the human mind and behavior.

The Russian Journal [[Konsultativnaya Psikhologiya i Psikhoterapiya]] publishes a special issue on Christian Psychology every year.

== History ==
Religious and science scholars have often clashed over the idea of the two subjects being combined, making Christian psychology no stranger to controversy. Christianity has affected the field of psychology throughout history and has influenced the beliefs and works of famous psychologists. in 17th-century Europe, aspects of psychology were thought to go against Christian teachings. For example important figures such as Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz have delayed or altered their ideas to match culturally acceptable beliefs at the time. This is because the publication of psychological theories that went against Christian teachings often resulted in punishment.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is a time period in which several groundbreaking ideas, including those of science and religion were introduced in Western society. Ideas geared toward the Catholic Church teachings were challenged. One scholar describes the shift in ideas during the Enlightenment as gradual and subtle, rather than sudden.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J.M.(1996). ''Religion and the Enlightenment: From Descartes to Kant''. Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophers contributed to the introduction of scientific ideas that clashed against religion at the time. One early contributor was a French philosopher, Rene Descartes. He reinforced an Aristotelian concept explaining the human mind that fit teachings of the Church—the idea of a soul. As time progressed, so did the existence and presence of once “radical” ideas. The question on the human ability to fully comprehend the existence of God was introduced by Pascal. Other philosophers, such as John Locke, brought on the concept of deism. Major ideas that influenced psychology and religion at the time were the rejection of “original sin”, acceptance of personal morality without religion, and an emphasis on the individual conscience. However, while this time period brought on many radical ideas that contradicted ideas of the church, that is not to say they were completely rejected. Ideas such as atheism and deism were continued to be perceived as radical schools of thought. Religious teachings still remain influential in modern areas of psychology.

== Significant people ==

===Rene Descartes===
[[Rene Descartes]], a famous French philosopher, contributed to the field of psychology while also keeping the Catholic church's beliefs in mind. Descartes' beliefs were controversial during the 17th-century because some of his beliefs went against Christian teachings. Contrary to Christian teachings, Descartes believed that animals could be understood as a machine that did not have a soul.&lt;ref name="Facher, R. E. 2012"&gt;Facher, R. E. &amp; Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology: A history (4th edition). New York, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not specifically say that humans did not have a soul, Christians found this statement to be controversial because human beings resembled animals. These beliefs were written in his work titled ''The World''. ''The World'' was never published because Descartes feared the Catholic church would punish him for his controversial beliefs.

===John Locke===
[[John Locke]], was an English philosopher, who took the stance of "reason" being "the last judge and Guide in ever Thing" even in religious matters. Evidence was not something he concerned himself with, and instead, was a seeker of consistency, meaning,
and how humans should respond to the desires and especially, their own faith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Losonsky, M. (2012). Locke and Leibniz on Religious Faith. British Journal For The History Of Philosophy, 20(4), 703-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his major contributions to psychology, was his [[Philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], in which this becomes the precursor to explaining the idea of identity and the self.

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], was a Lutheran philosopher, who unlike [[John Locke|Locke]], believed that there are some religious ideas that stand on their own as being irrefutable and incontrovertible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With this in mind, most of his philosophical ideas, including the ones that aided to the foundation of psychological concepts, were hoped to be nonintrusive to the Christian-based beliefs in Europe and also be used unified the division between the Christian denomination. As a major contribution to psychology, Leibniz made a distinction between conscious and unconscious states that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and other successors would further expand upon centuries later.&lt;ref name="Facher, R. E. 2012"/&gt;

== Modern influences ==

=== Christian counseling ===
[[Christian counseling]] is a manner of psychological therapy that emphasizes the importance of person's relationship with God. Christian counseling utilizes the ideas of Christian psychology in order to properly understand and treat patients. Both Christian psychology and Christian counseling help people understand the self psychologically and in the eyes of God. This specific form of counseling incorporates a person's unique religious views to create a more individualized form of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R. B. (1999). Christian Counseling: An Emerging Specialty. ''Counseling &amp; Values. 43(3).'' 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Image histogram}}

In [[image processing]] and [[photography]], a '''color histogram''' is a representation of the distribution of colors in an [[image]].  For digital images, a color histogram represents the number of [[pixel]]s that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the image's [[color space]], the set of all possible colors.

The color histogram can be built for any kind of color space, although the term is more often used for three-dimensional spaces like [[RGB color space|RGB]] or [[HSV color space|HSV]].  For [[monochromatic image]]s, the term '''intensity histogram''' may be used instead.  For multi-spectral images, where each pixel is represented by an arbitrary number of measurements (for example, beyond the three measurements in RGB), the color histogram is ''N''-dimensional, with N being the number of measurements taken. Each measurement has its own wavelength range of the light spectrum, some of which may be outside the visible spectrum.

If the set of possible color values is sufficiently small, each of those colors may be placed on a range by itself; then the histogram is merely the count of pixels that have each possible color.  Most often, the space is divided into an appropriate number of ranges, often arranged as a regular grid, each containing many similar color values.  The color histogram may also be represented and displayed as a smooth [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined over the color space that approximates the pixel counts.

Like other kinds of [[histogram]]s, the color histogram is a [[statistic]] that can be viewed as an approximation of an underlying continuous [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of colors values.

==Overview==

Color histograms are flexible constructs that can be built from images in various [[color space]]s, whether [[RGB color space|RGB]], [[rg chromaticity]] or any other color space of any dimension.  A histogram of an image is produced first by discretization of the colors in the image into a number of bins, and counting the number of image pixels in each bin.  For example, a Red–Blue chromaticity histogram can be formed by first normalizing color pixel values by dividing RGB values by R+G+B, then quantizing the normalized R and B coordinates into N bins each. A two-dimensional histogram of Red-Blue chromaticity divided into four bins (''N''=4) might yield a histogram that looks like this table:

A histogram can be N-dimensional. Although harder to display, a three-dimensional color histogram for the above example could be thought of as four separate Red-Blue histograms, where each of the four histograms contains the Red-Blue values for a bin of green (0-63, 64-127, 128-191, and 192-255).

The histogram provides a compact summarization of the distribution of data in an image. The color histogram of an image is relatively invariant with translation and rotation about the viewing axis, and varies only slowly with the angle of view.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Shapiro|Shapiro, Linda G.]] and Stockman, George C. "Computer Vision" Prentice Hall, 2003 {{ISBN|0-13-030796-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;    By comparing histograms signatures of two images and matching the color content of one image with the other, the color histogram is particularly well suited for the problem of recognizing an object of unknown position and rotation within a scene. Importantly, translation of an RGB image into the illumination invariant rg-chromaticity space allows the histogram to operate well in varying light levels.

1.What is a histogram?

A histogram is a graphical representation of the number of pixels in an image. In a more simple way to explain, a histogram is a bar graph, whose X-axis represents the tonal scale(black at the left and white at the right), and Y-axis represents the number of pixels in an image in a certain area of the tonal scale. For example, the graph of a luminance histogram shows the number of pixels for each brightness level(from black to white), and when there are more pixels, the peak at the certain luminance level is higher.

2.What is a color histogram?

A color histogram of an image represents the distribution of the composition of colors in the image. It shows different types of colors appeared and the number of pixels in each type of the colors appeared. The relation between a color histogram and a luminance histogram is that a color histogram can be also expressed as “Three Luminance Histograms”, each of which shows the brightness distribution of each individual Red/Green/Blue color channel.

==Characteristics of a color histogram==

A color histogram focuses only on the proportion of the number of different types of colors, regardless of the spatial location of the colors. The values of a color histogram are from statistics. They show the statistical distribution of colors and the essential tone of an image.

In general, as the color distributions of the foreground and background in an image are different, there might be a bimodal distribution in the histogram.

For the luminance histogram alone, there is no perfect histogram and in general, the histogram can tell whether it is over exposure or not, but there are times when you might think the image is over exposed by viewing the histogram; however, in reality it is not.

==Principles of the formation of a color histogram==

The formation of a color histogram is rather simple. From the definition above, we can simply count the number of pixels for each 256 scales in each of the 3 RGB channel, and plot them on 3 individual bar graphs.

In general, a color histogram is based on a certain color space, such as RGB or HSV. When we compute the pixels of different colors in an image, if the color space is large, then we can first divide the color space into certain numbers of small intervals. Each of the intervals is called a bin. This process is called color quantization. Then, by counting the number of pixels in each of the bins, we get the color histogram of the image.

The concrete steps of the principles can be viewed in Example 2.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Given the following image of a cat (an original version and a version that has been reduced to 256 colors for easy histogram purposes), the following data represents a color histogram in the RGB color space, using four bins. Bin 0 corresponds to intensities 0-63, bin 1 is 64-127, bin 2 is 128-191, and bin 3 is 192-255.

Application in camera:

Nowadays, some cameras have the ability of showing the 3 color histograms when we take photos. 

We can examine clips(spikes on either the black or white side of the scale) in each of the 3 RGB color histograms. If we find one or more clipping on a channel of the 3 RGB channels, then this would result in a loss of detail for that color.

To illustrate this, consider this example:

1.	We know that each of the three R, G, B channels has a range of values from 0-255(8 bit). So consider a photo that has a luminance range of 0-255.

2.	Assume the photo we take is made of 4 blocks that are adjacent to each other and we set the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of original photo to be 10, 100, 205, 245. Thus, the image looks like the first figure on the right. 

3.	Then, we over expose the photo a little, say, the luminance scale of each block is increased by 10. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 20, 110, 215, 255. Then, the image looks like the second figure on the right.

There is not much difference between figure 8 and figure 9, all we can see is that the whole image becomes brighter(the contrast for each of the blocks remain the same).

4.	Now, we over expose the original photo again, this time the luminance scale of each block is increased by 50. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 60, 150, 255, 255. The new image now looks like the third figure on the right.

Note that the scale for last block is 255 instead of 295, for 255 is the top scale and thus the last block has clipped! When this happens, we lose the contrast of the last 2 blocks, and thus, we cannot recover the image no matter how we adjust it.

To conclude, when taking photos with a camera that displays histograms, always keep the brightest tone in the image below the largest scale 255 on the histogram in order to avoid losing details.

==Drawbacks and other approaches==

The main drawback of histograms for classification is that the representation is dependent of the color of the object being studied, ignoring its shape and texture. Color histograms can potentially be identical for two images with different object content which happens to share color information. Conversely, without spatial or shape information, similar objects of different color may be indistinguishable based solely on color histogram comparisons. There is no way to distinguish a red and white cup from a red and white plate.  Put another way, histogram-based algorithms have no concept of a generic 'cup', and a model of a red and white cup is no use when given an otherwise identical blue and white cup. Another problem is that color histograms have high sensitivity to noisy interference such as lighting intensity changes and quantization errors. High dimensionality (bins) color histograms are also another issue. Some color histogram feature spaces often occupy more than one hundred dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Xiang-Yang Wang, Jun-Feng Wu1 and Hong-Ying Yang "Robust image retrieval based on color histogram of local feature regions" Springer Netherlands, 2009 ISSN 1573-7721&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the proposed solutions have been color histogram intersection, color constant indexing, cumulative color histogram, quadratic distance, and color [[correlogram]]s. Although there are drawbacks of using histograms for indexing and classification, using color in a real-time system has several advantages. One is that color information is faster to compute compared to other invariants. It has been shown in some cases that color can be an efficient method for identifying objects of known location and appearance.

Further research into the relationship between color histogram data to the physical properties of the objects in an image has shown they can represent not only object color and illumination but relate to surface roughness and image geometry and provide an improved estimate of illumination and object color.&lt;ref&gt;Anatomy of a color histogram;  Novak, C.L.; Shafer, S.A.; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1992. Proceedings CVPR '92., 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on 15–18 June 1992 Page(s):599 - 605 {{doi|10.1109/CVPR.1992.223129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, Euclidean distance, histogram intersection, or cosine or quadratic distances are used for the calculation of image similarity ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Integrated Spatial and Feature Image Systems: Retrieval, Analysis and Compression; Smith, J.R.; Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these values do not reflect the similarity rate of two images in itself; it is useful only when used in comparison to other similar values. This is the reason that all the practical implementations of content-based image retrieval must complete computation of all images from the database, and is the main disadvantage of these implementations.

Another approach to representative color image content is two-dimensional color histogram. A two-dimensional color histogram considers the relation between the pixel pair colors (not only the lighting component).&lt;ref&gt;Effectiveness estimation of image retrieval by 2D color histogram; Bashkov, E.A.; Kostyukova, N.S.; Journal of Automation and Information Sciences, 2006 (6) Page(s): 84-89&lt;/ref&gt; A two-dimensional color histogram is a two-dimensional array. The size of each dimension is the number of colors that were used in the phase of color quantization. These arrays are treated as matrices, each element of which stores a normalized count of pixel pairs, with each color corresponding to the index of an element in each pixel neighborhood. For comparison of two-dimensional color histograms it is suggested calculating their correlation, because constructed as described above, is a random vector (in other words, a multi-dimensional random value). While creating a set of final images, the images should be arranged in decreasing order of the correlation coefficient.

The correlation coefficient may also be used for color histogram comparison. Retrieval results with correlation coefficient are better than with other metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Color Histogram Correlation; Bashkov, E.A.; Shozda, N.S.; Graphicon proceedings, 2002 Page(s):  [http://www.graphicon.ru/2002/pdf/Bashkov_Zhozda_Re.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity histogram of continuous data==

The idea of an intensity histogram can be generalized to continuous data,
say audio signals represented by real functions or images represented by functions with two-dimensional [[Function domain|domain]].

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]]), then the cumulative histogram operator &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;H(f)(y) = \mu\{x : f(x)\le y\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lebesgue measure]] of sets.
&lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt; in turn is a [[real function]].
The (non-cumulative) histogram is defined as its [[derivative]].
:&lt;math&gt;h(f) = H(f)'&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Wiktionary|Cytherean}}
[[Image:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The term ''Cytherean'' can be used to refer to things from or related to the planet [[Venus]], pictured here.]]

'''Cytherean''' is an [[adjective]] meaning ''pertaining to [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]]'' (Greek ''Κύθηρα'', also transliterated ''Kythera'' or ''Kithira''), a small island now part of [[Greece]], southeast of the [[Peloponnesus]].  It  is  also an adjective meaning ''pertaining to the planet [[Venus]]''.

When [[planetary science|planetary scientists]] began to have a need to discuss Venus in detail, an adjective was needed. Based on [[Latin]] principles, the correct adjectival form of the name would be '''Venerean'''.  However, this term has an unfortunate similarity to the word ''venereal'' as in [[venereal diseases]] (related to "Venerean" as ''martial'' is to "Martian"), and is not generally used by astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~hanes/P15-2012/Notes/Theme09.Part01.Venus.html#PART%202|title=The Appearance of Venus: Its Importance|last1=Hanes|first1=Dave|work=Physics P15: The Course Notes, Fall 2012|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]ian is etymologically messy (similar to saying "Earthian" or "Jupiterian"), and a "cleaner" version was desired.

[[Image:The Birth of Venus by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1879).jpg|thumb|250px|left|A common theme in art, ''[[The Birth of Venus (Bouguereau)|The Birth of Venus]]'' is shown in this 1879 painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].]]

It was suggested that since Venus had a Greek name, as well as a Roman one, this should be used; however, the adjectival form of [[Aphrodite]] was "aphrodisial", which again was felt to be unfortunately close to "[[aphrodisiac]]", again evoking matters not directly pertaining to astronomy.

A compromise was reached.  In [[Greek mythology]], the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was said to have been born from the sea, from which she emerged on a sea shell at the island of Cythera, and as such was sometimes known as ''Cytherea''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Heydari-Malayeri, [http://aramis2.obspm.fr/~heydari/dictionary/?showAll=1&amp;search=Cytherean An Etymological Dictionary of Astronomy and Astrophysics English-French-Persian]. Accessed Oct. 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective Cytherean was taken from this name and remained popular in scientific literature for some time. Its perhaps forgotten usage in [[Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies|18th century erotica]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, "when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest". {{Citation | last = Denlinger | first = Elizabeth Campbell | title = The Garment and the Man: Masculine Desire in "Harris's List of Covent-Garden Ladies," 1764–1793 | work = Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume = 11, number 3 | year = 2002 | pages = 379 | publisher = University of Texas Press, hosted at jstor.org | jstor = 3704587}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not interfere with this choice.

The term has since fallen out of common use. '''Venusian''' is the form most frequently used, with others, including Venerean appearing from time to time;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Lazio. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part2 Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions]. Accessed Oct. 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the term Cytherean is now mostly found in older scientific papers, but some scientists still stick to the "tasteful" naming.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Hughes. [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05619.x/abs/ A comparison between terrestrial, Cytherean and lunar impact cratering records]". ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' Volume 334. August 2002. Page 713&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the word "Cytherean" as an adjective referring to Venus is often found in [[science fiction]] of the early and mid 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include [[weight management]] and eating "mainly vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish, and a reduced intake of red meat, animal fat, and refined sugar."&lt;ref name="Diet11" /&gt;

== Types of diet ==

=== Restrictive diets ===

A number of diets and diet-based regimes are claimed to be useful against cancer. Popular types of "anti-cancer" diet include the [[Breuss diet]], [[Gerson therapy]], the [[Budwig protocol]] and the [[macrobiotic diet]]. None of these diets has been found to be effective, and some of them have been found to be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hübner |first1= J |last2= Marienfeld |first2= S |last3= Abbenhardt |first3= C |last4= Ulrich |first4= CM |last5= Löser |first5= C |displayauthors= 4 |year= 2012 |title= How useful are diets against cancer? |journal= [[Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift]] |volume= 137 |issue= 47 |pages= 2417–22 |doi= 10.1055/s-0032-1327276 |pmid= 23152069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dietary patterns ===

[[nutritional epidemiology|Nutritional epidemiologists]] use [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[principal components analysis]] and [[factor analysis]], to measure how patterns of dietary behavior influence the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Edefonti |first1= V |last2= Randi |first2= G |last3= La Vecchia |first3= C |last4= Ferraroni |first4= M |last5= Decarli |first5= A |displayauthors= 4 |title= Dietary patterns and breast cancer: A review with focus on methodological issues |journal= Nutrition Reviews |volume= 67 |issue= 6 |pages= 297–314 |doi= 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The most well-studied dietary pattern is the [[mediterranean diet]].) Based on their dietary pattern score, [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] categorize people into [[quantiles]]. To estimate the influence of dietary behavior on risk of cancer, [[scientist|they]] [[Measure (probability)|measure]] the [[Association (statistics)|association]] between quantiles and the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of cancer [[prevalence]] (in [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) and cancer [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (in [[cohort study|longitudinal studies]]). They usually include other [[Variable (research)|variables]] in their [[statistical model]] to account for the other differences between people with and without cancer ([[confounding|confounders]]). For [[breast cancer]], there is a [[Replicate (statistics)|replicated]] trend for [[woman|women]] with a more "prudent or healthy" diet, i.e. higher in [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, to have a lower [[risk]] of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brennan |first1= SF |last2= Cantwell |first2= MM |last3= Cardwell |first3= CR |last4= Velentzis |first4= LS |last5= Woodside |first5= JV |displayauthors= 4 |title= Dietary patterns and breast cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] |url= http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/5/1294.long |date= May 2010 |volume= 91 |issue= 5 |pages= 1294–302 |pmid= 20219961 |doi= 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28796}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "drinker dietary pattern" is also associated with higher breast cancer risk, while the association is inconsistent between a more [[Western pattern diet|westernized diet]] and elevated risk of breast cancer. [[Pickled foods]] are linked with cancer.

Assimilated methionine is transformed in [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) which is a key [[metabolite]] for [[polyamine]] synthesis, e.g. [[spermidine]], and [[cysteine]] formation (see the figure on the right). [[Methionine]] breakdown products are also recycled back into [[methionine]] by [[homocysteine]] remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, [[folic acid]] and [[choline]] are essential cofactors for these reactions. SAM is the substrate for [[methylation]] reactions catalyzed by DNA, RNA and protein [[methyltransferase]]s. 
[[Image:PRMTpathway.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Growth factor (GF) and steroid/retinoid activation of PRMT4.]]
The products of these reactions are [[methylated]] [[DNA]], [[RNA]] or [[proteins]] and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase [[enzymes]]. Therefore, SAM:SAH ratio directly regulates cellular methylation, whereas levels of vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, folic acid and [[choline]] regulates indirectly the [[methylation]] state via the [[methionine]] metabolism cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Caudill |first1= MA |last2= Wang |first2= JC |last3= Melnyk |first3= S |last4= Pogribny |first4= IP |last5= Jernigan |first5= S |last6= Collins |first6= MD |last7= Santos-Guzman |first7= J |last8= Swendseid |first8= ME |last9= Cogger |first9= EA |last10= James |first10= SJ |displayauthors= 4 |year= 2001 |title= Intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations predict global DNA hypomethylation in tissues of methyl-deficient cystathionine ß-synthase heterozygous mice |journal= [[Journal of Nutrition]] |pmid= 11694601 |volume= 131 |issue= 11 |pages= 2811–8 |url= http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/11/2811.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Poirier |first1= LA |last2= Wise |first2= CK |last3= Delongchamp |first3= RR |last4= Sinha |first4= R |title= Blood determinations of S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and homocysteine: Correlations with diet |journal= [[Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention]] |volume= 10 |issue= 6 |pages= 649–55 |date= June 2001 |pmid= 11401915 |url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11401915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A near ubiquitous feature of [[cancer]] is a maladaption of the [[methionine]] [[metabolic pathway]] in response to genetic or environmental conditions resulting in depletion of SAM and/or SAM-dependent [[methylation]].

=== Signaling pathways ===
Multiple oncogenic signaling pathways have been involved in the processes of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Among these signaling pathways, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways are involved in the embryonic development, in the biology of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in the acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).&lt;ref name= "Sarkar2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9008">'''EcoProIT''' is a project initiated at [[Chalmers University of Technology]] at the department of Product and Production Development. The project aims to provide production engineers a tool for detailed [[ecological footprint]] analyses, which are becoming more important in terms of marketing and legislation.&lt;ref Name=Haanaes/&gt; A published report by [[MIT]] in 2011 showed companies thought that environmental sustainable strategy is, or will be, vital to be competitive.&lt;ref Name =Haanaes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haanaes|first=Knut|title=Sustainability: The 'Embracers' Seize Advantage|journal=MIT Sloan Management Review|year=2011|volume=Winter|url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/feature/sustainability-advantage/|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report included many sectors, e.g. covering medicals, automobiles and consumer products. EcoProIT will design a tool for industrial applications used for detailed environmental footprint analyses of their production systems and the products produced using simulation. The tool will simulate the production and analyze the product's environmental footprint in a standardized way. It will also be possible to use the tool for bench marking between different sites. The aim for the tool puts high requirements on standardized methods and data management.

== Vision - Tool usage ==
The vision of the usage of EcoProIT is important. Company A, who is a big and important stakeholder, is the main user of the tool in Figure 1. They require their close supplier partner to use the same tool. Company A and supplier A and B then set up an internal connection of their tools. The connection makes the input information for Company A up to date for every use. Company A also sets up a connection to their close partners that buy or distribute Company A’s products. It will then be possible to give a good estimation of the impact total specific distribution chain that will be up to data. The information can be used to inform the end users about total costs for the production data. The up to date chain gives a possibility to show the consumers that the company makes progress in lowering the environmental impact. Every improvement is delivered directly to the customers, and the new marketing possibility show what the production department is doing for the environment.

All information that is produced by the tool should be able to be uploaded to the central EcoProIT Database that stores it in a standardized way to be able to be used by other companies. The tool is also connected to other LCA databases to be able to use as input for the raw materials used in the production. Figure 1 shows a schematic view on how the system could be connected.

== Environmental Activity-Based Costing ==
As an approach to calculation of the impact, [[activity-based costing]] (ABC) will be used for calculations of environmental costs. Emblemssvåg and Bras&lt;ref name=emb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emblemsvåg|first=Jan|title=Activity-Based Life-Cycle Costing|journal=Managerial Auditing Journal|year=2001|volume=16|issue=7|pages=635–654}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked and analyzed the ABC as a method for environmental analyses. The method substitutes the cost for the production in money with an environmental emission, e.g. [[CO2|CO]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=emb /&gt; The emissions are measured and calculated from the energy and resources used. Then the emissions are allocated to the different products produced using the resources in the model.

The problems with ABC is that it requires a lot of data for a qualitative and accurate allocation of the cost from the resources. This is why the method fits well into a DES model. During a run In a DES environment it is easy to grab lot of detailed results needed for accurate allocation. The problem is that DES require a lot of initial effort to build the model. The approach to analyze environmental impact in a DES model is only beneficial if there is requirements for detailed analyzes and “what-if” scenarios is needed.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Jon|author2=Anders Skoogh |author3=Björn Johansson |title=Environmental Activity Based Cost using Discrete Event Simulation|journal=Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference|year=2011|pages=891–902|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/cpl/record/index.xsql?pubid=150381|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Erik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindskog|first=Erik|author2=Linus Lund |author3=Jonatan Berglund |author4=Tina Lee |author5=Anders Skoogh |author6=Björn Johansson |title=A Method for Determining the Environmental Footprint of Industrial Products Using Simulation|journal=Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference|year=2011|pages=2136–2147|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/cpl/record/index.xsql?pubid=150460|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchically modeling approach==
When LCA is included in a production simulation model, there is a bigger need for output information to perform the calculations. To be able to allocate environmental load that origins from the facilities the product that used the facility need to be traced. Environmental load that origin form the maintenance needs to be allocated based on the machines use of the maintenance. Machines that use other resources as compressed air or other supporting machines needs to be associated to trace the usage of those resources to be able to allocate the environmental load to the products that used the machine.

Andersson, J et al. (2012) &lt;ref name=tool&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Jon|author2=Björn Johansson |author3=Jonatan Berglund |author4=Anders Skoogh |title=Framework for Ecolabeling using Discrete Event Simulation|journal=Proceedings of the 2012 Spring Simulation Multiconference|year=2012|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_156301.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to model the machines and resources in a hierarchy. The approach is based on that all product types have attributes with weight and size. The attributes is used together with the time the product has been in each resources to allocate the environmental load to all products using the resource at the same time. A product that is using a machine is also using the machines and facilities in the upper hierarchy. The approach supports increasingly detailed modeling. The modeler increase the level of detail by model each box in greater detail in a lower lever in the hierarchy. The modeler can in other nodes stay at a brief level with less dynamics.

==Verification/Validation Strategies==
Environmental impact is in general hard to validate. To be able to trust the models is very important that the models are transparent and provide multiple levels of verification. The strategy here is to not calculate everything in the simulation model and instead provide results, which can be verified, to calculate the used resources from. E.g. from the amount of processing time for a machine it is possible to calculate the used energy. From the used resources upstream processes required to produce the resources can be included to get a total emission for the production, e.g. if the emissions to produce one kWh electricity is 0.1 kgCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then the 4 kWh electricity used in a machine give an emission of 0.4 kgCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The concept is called Level of Equation. The basis is to divide the calculations of environmental impact into 4 levels&lt;ref name=EvaluatioOfMethods&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/publication/167292 | title=Evaluation of Methods used for Life-cycle Assessment in Discrete Event Simulation | accessdate=December 19, 2012 |author1=Andersson, Jon |author2=Skoogh, Anders |author3=Johansson, Björn | booktitle=Proceeding of Winter Simulation Conference 2012 |date=December 2012  | conference=Winter Simulation Conference | location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''Eisenhower College''' was a small college named after U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], located on [[Cayuga Lake]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]]. It was founded on September 21, 1965 as a [[liberal arts college]]. Private funds and two federal grants totaling $14.5 million helped established the college, which opened its doors to its first class in 1968.

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each [[Eisenhower Dollar]] coin went to the college.  This amounted to some $9 million between the coin's initial production in 1971 and 1978, when production ceased.

Eisenhower curricula were centered on a core set of courses collectively known as "World Studies."   These mandatory courses examined the history of civilization from the ascent of Man through modern times in music, art, history, science, philosophy and literature. Foreign language and physical education courses were also mandatory.

Until 1979, the campus housed the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].

In March 1979, the liberal arts college, which had a total enrollment of only 460 students and was experiencing financial difficulties, was acquired by [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT).  On July 22, 1982, RIT announced the immediate closing of Eisenhower College due to "major operating deficits."  Current students and faculty were given the opportunity to transfer to RIT's main campus for the 1982/83 school year.

In 1989, the property was sold to the [[New York Chiropractic College]] which continues to operate the campus. An archive of Eisenhower College material, donated by former professors and alumni, was stored at the campus library as of 2006.

The '''Fine-Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector''' ('''FREND''') is a [[Neutron detection|neutron detector]] that is part of the instrument payload on board the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO), launched to [[Mars]] in March 2016.  This instrument is currently mapping [[hydrogen]] levels to a maximum depth of {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} beneath the Martian surface, thus revealing shallow water ice distribution.This instrument has an improved resolution of 7.5 times over the one Russia contributed to NASA's ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter.

==Overview==

FREND can provide information while orbiting Mars on the presence of hydrogen, in the form of [[Water on Mars|water]] or [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] in the top {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} of the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="ria2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140804/191710468/Russia-to-Construct-Landing-Pad-for-Russian-European.html |title=Russia to Construct Landing Pad for Russian-European "ExoMars-2018" Space Mission |work=RIA Novosti |location=Russia |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='FREND home'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/48523-trace-gas-orbiter-instruments/?fbodylongid=2217 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Instruments: FREND - Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector].

Mapping ground ice could also be useful for future resource utilization ([[ISRU]]) and crewed missions.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

FREND also features a [[dosimeter]] to monitor the radiation environment along its orbit around Mars.&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

==Objectives==

The main science objective of the instrument is to carry out high spatial resolution mapping of [[Neutron temperature|epithermal and fast]] neutron fluxes from the Martian surface.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt; FREND will work in synergy and complement orbital and ground data as measured the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) instrument on the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], the [[ADRON-RM]] instrument on the [[ExoMars (rover)|ExoMars rover]] and the ADRON-EM on the [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]].&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

The second goal of FREND is to use its [[dosimeter]] to measure the radiation dose at the TGO orbit from [[Particle physics|energetic particle]]s of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar flare]]s. The data will be used to estimate exposure levels of spacecraft and maintain radiation safety of  crewed interplanetary flights.&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

[[Cosmic ray]]s are sufficiently energetic to break apart atoms in the top one or two metres of Mars' surface, releasing high-energy neutrons, which can be measured by FREND instrument.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt; The distribution of neutron velocities measured reveals the hydrogen content, which are a good indicator of hydrogen abundance —water or [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]]— in the shallow subsurface of Mars.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

FREND uses inherited technology developed by the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] and flown on the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) on ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''; the Mercury Gamma and Neutron Spectrometer (MGNS) on ''[[BepiColombo]]''; the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) on the ''[[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', and [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) on [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]].&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

This instrument's key components are four detectors containing [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He) for neutrons with energies from 0.4 keV to 500 keV, and a stilbene-based [[scintillator]] for high-energy neutrons up to 10 MeV.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt; Each of the four &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He detectors counts neutrons independently for increased reliability.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt; All five detectors are encased within a [[collimator]] that improves the resolution 7.5 times over the one Russia contributed to NASA's ''Mars Odyssey'' orbiter.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

Floral formulae are one of the two ways of describing flower structure developed during the 19th century, the other being [[floral diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="prenner" /&gt; The format of floral formulae differs between authors, yet they tend to convey the same information.&lt;ref name="craene" /&gt;

== History ==
Floral formulae were developed at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="prenner" /&gt; The first authors using them were Cassel&lt;ref name="cassel" /&gt; (1820) and Martius&lt;ref name="martius" /&gt; (1828). Grisebach&lt;ref name="grisebach" /&gt; (1854) used them in his textbook to describe characteristics of floral families, stating numbers of different organs separated by commas and highlighting fusion. Sachs&lt;ref name="sachs" /&gt; (1873) used them together with floral diagrams, he noted their advantage of being composed of "ordinary [[typeface]]". Although Eichler widely used floral diagrams in his ''Blüthendiagramme'',&lt;ref name="eichler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eichler2" /&gt; he used floral formulae sparingly, mainly for families with simple flowers. Sattler's&lt;ref name="sattler" /&gt; ''Organogenesis of Flowers'' (1973) takes advantage of floral formulae and diagrams to describe the [[ontogeny]] of 50 plant species. Newer books containing formulae include ''Plant Systematics'' by Judd ''et al.''&lt;ref name="judd" /&gt; (2002) and Simpson&lt;ref name="simpson" /&gt; (2010). Prenner ''et al.'' devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula and argued that formulae should be included in formal [[Biological classification|taxonomic]] descriptions.&lt;ref name="prenner" /&gt; Ronse De Craene (2010)&lt;ref name="craene" /&gt; partially utilized their way of writing the formulae in his book ''Floral Diagrams''.

== Contained information ==

=== Organ numbers and fusion ===
The formula expresses counts of different floral organs,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bracts and bracteoles are not considered parts of the flower itself, yet they may be included in the floral formula&lt;/ref&gt; these are usually preceded by letters or abbreviations according to the organ type. They are ordered corresponding to the arrangement of the parts of the flower from the outside to the inside:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="background: #d7d7d7"|[[Bract]]s !! style="background: #d7d7d7"|[[Bracteole]]s !! colspan="2"|Tepals (''perigon'' or ''[[perianth]]''), or [[sepal]]s (''calyx'') and [[petal]]s (''corolla'') !! [[Stamen]]s (''androecium'') !! [[Carpel]]s (''gynoecium'') !! style="background: #d7d7d7"|[[Ovule]]s	
|-
| style="background: #d7d7d7" rowspan="2"|B&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; || style="background: #d7d7d7" rowspan="2"|Bt&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; || colspan="2"|P&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; or CaCo&lt;ref name="cactus"/&gt; || rowspan="2"|A || rowspan="2"|G || style="background: #d7d7d7" rowspan="2"|V&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; or O&lt;ref name="sattler"/&gt;
|-
| K&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; or Ca&lt;ref name="cactus"/&gt; || C&lt;ref name="prenner"/&gt; or Co&lt;ref name="cactus"/&gt;
|}
The labels with darker backgrounds are less common. "V" used by Prenner ''et al.'' for the number of ovules per gynoecium is followed by lowercase letter describing the type of [[Ovule#Location within the plant|placentation]]. For [[epicalyx]]/[[calyculus]], the letter "k" is used.

The numbers are inserted after the labels, they may be formatted as sub- or superscript. If an organ is absent, its number is written as "0" or it is omitted, if there are "many" (usually more than 10–12) instances, it can be written as "∞". Whorls of the same organ are separated by "+". Organ counts within a whorl can be separated by ":", for example when part of the whorl is morphologically different. A range can be given if the number is variable, e.g. when the formula summarizes a taxon.

: K&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt; – a calyx with six free sepals, arranged as two separate whorls
: A∞ – many stamens
: P3–12 – perianth from three to twelve tepals

Groups of organs can be described by writing the number of instances in the group as superscript.

: A5² – 5 groups of 2 stamens

The formula can also express organ fusion. Fusion of one organ type can be shown by enclosing the number in a circle, fusion of different organs can be represented by [[Tie (typography)|ties]], as e.g. in Judd ''et al.'' Prenner ''et al.'' state that this method is difficult to achieve via standard typesetting.&lt;ref name="prenner" /&gt;{{rp|242}} Joining of organs can be more readily written using [[parentheses]] "(…)" if instances of the same organ are fused. Fusion between different organs can be achieved by [[square brackets|square]] "[…]", eventually [[curly brackets]] "{…}".
: A(5) – five fused stamens
: [C(5) A5] – corolla fused from 5 petals, fused to stamens
Prenner ''et al.'' propose superscript zero for a lost organ, and superscript "r" for a reduced one. Ronse De Craene uses a [[degree symbol]] to mark a [[staminode]] (infertile stamen) or [[pistillode]] (infertile carpel).

: A3:2&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;+5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; – (Prenner ''et al.'') androecium in two whorls, first contains 3 stamens and 2 staminodes, second whorl lost
: A1+2° – (Ronse De Craene) androecium in two whorls, first whorl containing a stamen, second whorl containing two staminodes

=== Ovary position ===
Ovary position is shown by alternating the "G" label. Simpson circumvents the intricate formatting by expressing the ovary position by words.

{| class="wikitable"

|G…, superior|| G…, inferior || G…, half-inferior
|}

=== Symmetry ===
[[Floral symmetry|Symmetry]] or arrangement may be described for the whole flower, in such case the corresponding symbol is usually placed at the beginning of the formula. It may be also outlined separately for different organs, placing it after their labels or numbers, or it may not be included in the formula at all. It is described by following symbols:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

=== Sexuality ===
Sexuality of the flower can be highlighted by ☿ or [[File:Male and female sign.svg|12px|frameless]] for hermaphrodite (bisexual), ♂ for male (staminate) and ♀ for female (pistillate) flower. The symbols are usually placed at the beginning of the formula, after or before the symmetry symbol. Prenner ''et al.'' recommend to use the corresponding symbols (♀ and ♂) only for flowers of separate sexuality. Ronse De Craene utilizes the words "pistillate" or "staminate" instead of the symbols.

Floral formula can also incorporate the fruit type, Judd ''et al.''&lt;ref name="judd" /&gt; place it at the very end.

==Examples==
&lt;big&gt;↯ K3 [C3 A1°–3°+½:2°] Ğ(3)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="craene" /&gt;{{rp|39}} – the formula of ''[[Canna edulis]]''; asymmetric flower; calyx of three free sepals; corolla of three free petals joined with androecium; androecium in two whorls, the outer whorl contains 1–3 staminodes, the inner contains ½ of a stamen and 2 staminodes; gynoecium fused of 3 carpels, inferior ovary

&lt;big&gt;B Bt&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; K3:(2)&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;↓ C3:2&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;↓ A(3):2&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;↓+4&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;:1&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{underline|G}}1↓ Vm8–10&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="prenner" /&gt;{{rp|246}} – the formula of ''[[Tamarindus indica]]''; bract and petaloid bracteoles; monosymmetric calyx of three and two petaloid sepals; monosymmetric corolla of three and two reduced petals; two whorls of stamens, the outer monosymmetric from three fused and two reduced stamens, the inner of 4 reduced and 1 lost stamen; monosymmetric gynoecium of 1 carpel with superior ovary; marginal placentation with 8–10 ovules per gynoecium.

'''French Gothic architecture''' is a style which emerged in France in 1140, and was dominant until the mid-16th century. The most notable examples are the great Gothic cathedrals of France, including [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
French Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[Ile-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081-1137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place.  The Abbot of Saint-Denis,  [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as an historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings; [[Philip Augustus]] (1180-1223); [[Louis IX of France]] (1226-1270) and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285-1314) established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]].  It produced the high Gothic and the Flamboyant Gothic styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The rib vault===
The Gothic style emerged from innovative use of existing technologies, such as the pointed arch and the [[rib vault]].   The [[rib vault]] was known in the earlier Romanesque period, but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below, and established a closer connection  between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls, and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flying buttress===
The second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone pinnacles were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church.   In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals.  Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels,  a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the tribune, a gallery with windows; then the triforium, a row of smaller windows, and finally the high windows. just below the vaults.   During the high Gothic period, with the development of the four part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pages 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

===The portal and tympanum===
Another innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral  was the design of the portal or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This  triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals.  A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]  over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating  a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass and the rose window===

Large [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The [[Rose window]] was the most famous type of the Gohtic style.  They were plead in the transepts and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter.  They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind.  Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.

The early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with grisaille painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used.  After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of  [[grisaille]] and pale shades of yellow became more common.  [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of Gothic styles==
The periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pgs. 31-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130-1230)

Because of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic Cathedrals, very few were built in a single style.  Most, like Notre Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.

==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[Île-de-France]], not far north of Paris,  where in 1137 The [[Abbé Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from  1140 to 1144  began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new choir at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]]; the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]; the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels; and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults.   The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time had all been combined and the result differed  dramatically  from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals, notably [[Sens Cathedral]], the first Gothic Cathedral  (begun 1135); [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new  Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the [[flying buttress]], heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Gothic Cathedrals: Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably  [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by with an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period of French gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency  toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamboyant Gothic: Rouen Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Flamboyant Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[Île-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features a vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032–1523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Musée Jean-Lurçat, a museum of contemporary tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under KingH [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211–1331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280–1325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220–1522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier romanesque churches on the same site.

The south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style : the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world.

==Gothic civil architecture==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration  borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing  gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I,  due to their proximity to the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), page 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Gothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities.  examples include the [[Hôtel Cluny]] (now the [[Musée de Cluny – Musée national du Moyen Âge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques Cœur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440–50).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569–1573  made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cathédrale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507–1512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carré of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533–1568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012) page 26–27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious –buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschaussé (1613–1620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615–21) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model.  However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris, (1532–1640) which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a gothic plan with renaissance decoration.

In the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[François Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Molière]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...".

During the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]].   The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round  were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire  arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings  (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below.  In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pgs. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed.    The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers, to  One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337-1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.   The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the city of [[Carcasonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Château de Pierrefonds]], (1393-1407)  an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the façade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalog the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of "Monuments of France". In 1831 interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832 Hugo wrote an article for the ''Revue des deux Mondes'' which declared war against the "massacre of ancient stones" and the "demolishers" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[François Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne.  In 1833 Prosper Mérimée became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156–159}}

Under Louis Philippe,French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under Mérimée's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835 The church of [[Saint-Séverin, Paris|Saint Séverin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by  [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution,  The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[Félix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].   In 1843 Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] &lt;ref&gt;Darcos (1988), page 156-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.

French Gothic architecture also experienced a modest  revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841–57);  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65).  Jean=Baptiste  Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacré-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the Église de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}   The [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cécile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854–55) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework.  [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012), pgs. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture and Symbolism - the "Book for the Poor"==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a "book for the poor", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].

The exteriors of Cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters, These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gargoyle]] also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.

Amid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the Cathedral.  Inapired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  In Cathedrals, they were known as the "Path of Jerusalem" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.

==Sculpture==
The portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates Classical, literary elements with its 13th century Gothic style. In [[Auxerre]], two such examples of sculptures are upon the Cathedral of [[Saint-Étienne]] depicting [[Hercules]], a satyr, and a sleeping faun; the Chartres–[[Reims]] cathedral's north transept illustrates the biblical tale of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]]. The [[Sens Cathedral]]'s "Coronation of the Virgin" reflects a similar relief cathedral on the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris, and was created in a workshop that made minor contributions to [[Spanish Gothic architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Paul. "Gothic Sculpture 1140–1300". {{ISBN|978-0300074529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable structures==
Early Gothic:
* The east end of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]] (begun 1135)
* [[Noyon Cathedral]] (1145–1235)
* [[Sens Cathedral]] (1135–1534)
* [[Lyon Cathedral]]
* [[Toul Cathedral]]
* The west façade of [[Chartres Cathedral]]
* [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (started 1163)
* [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] (1160–1230)

High Gothic:
* The main body of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194–1260)
* [[Amiens Cathedral]] (nave constructed 1220–1269)
* [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]
* [[Bourges Cathedral]]

Rayonnant:
* The nave of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]]
* [[Reims Cathedral]]
* [[Sainte-Chapelle]]

Late Gothic ([[Flamboyant]]):
* The north tower of [[Chartres Cathedral]]
* The [[rose window]] of [[Amiens Cathedral]]
* The west facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]]
* [[Church of Saint-Maclou]], [[Rouen]].
* The north façade, south façade, and south porch of the [[Church of Notre-Dame de Louviers]]

The '''greater sciatic foramen''' is an opening ([[:wikt:foramen|foramen]]) in the posterior [[human pelvis]]. It is formed by the [[sacrotuberous ligament|sacrotuberous]] and [[sacrospinous ligament]]s. The [[piriformis muscle]] passes through the foramen and occupies most of its volume. The greater sciatic foramen is wider in women than in men.

==Structure==
It is bounded as follows:
* anterolaterally by the [[greater sciatic notch]] of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]]
* posteromedially by the [[sacrotuberous ligament]]
* inferiorly by the [[sacrospinous ligament]] and the ischial spine
* superiorly by the anterior sacroilliac ligament

==Function==
The [[piriformis]], which exits the pelvis through the foramen, occupies most of its volume.

The following structures also exit the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen:

The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helioseismology''', a term coined by [[Douglas Gough]], is the study of the structure and dynamics of the [[Sun]] through its oscillations.  These are principally caused by sound waves that are continuously driven and damped by convection near the Sun's surface.  It is similar to [[seismology|geoseismology]], or [[asteroseismology]] (also coined by Gough), which are respectively the studies of the [[Earth]] or [[star]]s through their oscillations. While the Sun's oscillations were first detected in the early 1960s, it was only in the mid-1970s that it was realised that the oscillations propagated throughout the Sun and could allow scientists to study the Sun's deep interior.  The modern field is separated into '''global helioseismology''', which studies the Sun's resonant modes, and '''local helioseismology''', which studies all the waves propagating at the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name="gb2005"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gizon | first1 = L. | last2 = Birch | first2 = A.

Helioseismology has contributed to a number of scientific breakthroughs.  The most notable was to show the predicted neutrino flux from the Sun could not be caused by flaws in stellar models and must instead be a problem of [[particle physics]].  The so-called [[solar neutrino problem]] was ultimately resolved by [[neutrino oscillations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bahcall | first1 = J.

The experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations was recognized by the 2015 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34443695 | title=Neutrino 'flip' wins physics Nobel Prize | journal=BBC News | date=6 October 2015 | author=Webb, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Helioseismology also allowed accurate measurements of the quadrupole (and higher-order) moments of the Sun's gravitational potential, which are consistent with [[general relativity]].  The first helioseismic calculations of the Sun's internal rotation profile showed a rough separation into a rigidly-rotating core and differentially-rotating envelope.  The boundary layer is now known as the [[tachocline]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Spiegel | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Zahn | first2 = J.-P. | title = The solar tachocline | year = 1992 | journal =  	Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 265 | pages = 106| bibcode = 1992A&amp;A...265..106S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to be a key component for the [[solar dynamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Fan | first1 = Y. | title = Magnetic Fields in the Solar Convection Zone | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 4| bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....4F| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it roughly coincides with the base of the solar convection zone—also inferred through helioseismology—it is conceptually a distinct entity.

Helioseismology benefits most from continuous monitoring of the Sun, which began first with uninterrupted observations from near the [[South Pole]] over the southern summer.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Duvall | first1 = Jr. T. L. | last2 = Harvey | first2 = J.

These studies are made possible by global telescope networks like the [[Global Oscillations Network Group]] (GONG) and the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]] (BiSON), which have been operating for over 20 years.

The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]
Solar oscillation modes are interpreted (to first order) as vibrations of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluid in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].  Each mode is then characterised by three numbers:

* the number of nodal shells in radius, known as the ''radial order'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;;
* the total number of nodal circles on each spherical shell, known as the ''angular degree'' &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the number of those nodal circles that are longitudinal, known as the ''azimuthal order'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter two correspond to the quantum numbers of the [[spherical harmonic]]s.  Under these assumptions, it can be shown that
the oscillations are separated into two categories of interior oscillations and a third special category of surface modes.

=== Pressure modes (p-modes) ===

Pressure modes are in essence standing sound waves.  The dominant restoring force is the pressure (rather than buoyancy), hence the name.  All the solar oscillations that are used for inferences about the interior are p-modes, with frequencies between about 1 and 5 millihertz. They span angular degrees from zero (purely radial motion) to several hundred.

=== Gravity modes (g-modes) ===

Gravity modes are lower-frequency modes that are confined to the convectively-stable interior.  The restoring force is buoyancy and thus indirectly gravity, from which they take their name.

=== Surface gravity modes (f-modes) ===

Surface gravity waves are analogous to waves on deep water.  To good approximation, they follow the same dispersion law: &lt;math&gt;\omega^2=gk_h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the surface gravity and &lt;math&gt;k_h&lt;/math&gt; is the horizontal wavenumber.  Surface gravity modes observed on the Sun are all of very high degree (&lt;math&gt;\ell\gtrsim80&lt;/math&gt;).

The low-frequency region is dominated by the signal of granulation. As the angular degree increases, the individual mode frequencies converge onto clear ridges, each corresponding to a sequence of low-order modes.]]

The chief tool for analysing data in global helioseismology is the [[Fourier transform]].  To good approximation, each mode is a damped harmonic oscillator, for which the power as a function of frequency is a [[Lorentz function]].  Resolved data is usually integrated over the desired spherical harmonic to obtain a single timeseries that can be Fourier transformed.  In this way, helioseismologists combine a power spectrum for each spherical harmonic into a two-dimensional power spectrum.

The lower frequency range of the oscillations is dominated by the variations caused by [[granulation (solar physics)|granulation]]. This must first be filtered out before (or at the same time that) the modes are analysed.  Granular flows at the solar surface are mostly horizontal, from the centres of the rising granules to the narrow downdrafts between them.  Relative to the oscillations, granulation produces a stronger signal in intensity than line-of-sight velocity, so the latter is preferred for helioseismic observatories.

=== Local helioseismology ===

Thus, ring-diagram analysis is a generalization of global helioseismology applied to local areas on the Sun (as opposed to half of the Sun). For example, the sound speed and [[adiabatic index]] can be compared within magnetically active and inactive (quiet Sun) regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Basu, S. |author2=Antia, H.M. |author3=Bogart, R.S. |title= Ring-Diagram Analysis of the Structure of Solar Active Regions |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= August 2004 |volume= 610 |issue= 2 |pages= 1157–1168 |doi= 10.1086/421843 |bibcode= 2004ApJ...610.1157B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions on the far side of the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like [[seismic migration]], a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Donea, A.-C. |author2=Braun, D.C. |author3=Lindsey, C. |title= Seismic Images of a Solar Flare |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= March 1999 |volume= 513 |issue= 2 |pages= L143–L146 |doi= 10.1086/311915 |bibcode= 1999ApJ...513L.143D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inversion ==

=== Introduction ===

The Sun's oscillation modes represent a discrete set of observations that are sensitive to its continuous structure.  This allows scientists to formulate [[inverse problem]]s for the Sun's interior structure and dynamics.  Given a reference model of the Sun, the differences in the mode frequencies are weighted averages of the differences between the structure of the reference model and the real Sun.  The difference in the mode frequencies can then be used to infer the differences in the structures.  The weighting functions of these averages are known as ''kernels''.

=== Structure ===

The first inversions of the Sun's structure were made using Duvall's law&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Duvall | first2 = Jr. T.

=== Rotation ===
[[File:HMI 2D solar rotation profile.png|thumb|The internal rotation profile of the Sun inferred using data from the [[Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager]] aboard the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]]. The inner radius has been truncated where the measurements are less certain than 1%, which happens around 3/4 of the way to the core. The dashed line indicates the base of the solar convection zone, which happens to coincide with the boundary at which the rotation profile changes, known as the tachocline.]]

If the Sun were perfectly spherical, the modes with different azimuthal orders ''m'' would have the same frequencies.  Rotation, however, breaks this degeneracy, and the modes frequencies differ by ''rotational splittings'' that are weighted-averages of the rotation rate throughout the Sun.  
Different modes are sensitive to different parts of the Sun and, given enough data, these differences can be used to infer the rotation rate throughout the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M.

In reality, different layers of the Sun rotate at different speeds, as can be seen at the surface, where the equator rotates faster than the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Beck | first1 = J. G. | title = A comparison of differential rotation measurements - (Invited Review) | year = 2000 | journal = Solar Physics | volume = 191 | pages = 47| bibcode = 2000SoPh..191...47B| doi = 10.1023/A:1005226402796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sun rotates slowly enough that a spherical, non-rotating model serves as close enough to reality to derive the rotational kernels.

Helioseismology has shown that the Sun has a rotation profile with several features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Howe | first1 = R. | title = Solar Interior Rotation and its Variation | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 1| arxiv = 0902.2406 | bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....1H| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a rigidly-rotating radiative (i.e. non-convective) zone, though the rotation rate of the inner core is not well known;
* a thin shear layer, known as the ''tachocline'', which separates the rigidly-rotating interior and the differentially-rotating convective envelope;
* a convective envelope in which the rotation rate varies both with depth and latitude; and
* a final shear layer just beneath the surface, in which the rotation rate slows down towards the surface.

== Relationship to other fields ==

=== Geoseismology ===

{{Main|Seismology}}

Helioseismology was born from analogy with [[seismology|geoseismology]] but several important differences remain.  First, the Sun lacks a solid surface and therefore cannot support [[shear wave]]s.  From the data analysis perspective, global helioseismology differs from geoseismology by studying only normal modes.  Local helioseismology is thus somewhat closer in spirit to geoseismology in the sense that it studies the complete wavefield.

=== Asteroseismology ===

{{Main|Asteroseismology}}

Because the Sun is a star, helioseismology is closely related to the study of oscillations in other stars, known as [[asteroseismology]]. Helioseismology is most closely related to the study of stars whose oscillations are also driven and damped by their outer convection zones, known as [[solar-like oscillations|solar-like oscillators]], but the underlying theory is broadly the same for other classes of variable star.

The principal difference is that oscillations in distant stars cannot be resolved.  Because the brighter and darker sectors of the spherical harmonic cancel out, this restricts asteroseismology almost entirely to the study of low degree modes (angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell\leq3&lt;/math&gt;).  This makes inversion much more difficult but upper limits can still be achieved by making more restrictive assumptions.

== History ==

At a similar time,  [[Jørgen Christensen-Dalsgaard]] and [[Douglas Gough]] suggested the potential of using individual mode frequencies to infer the interior structure of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Gough | first2 = D.

Helioseismology developed rapidly in the 1980s. A major breakthrough was made when observations from [[Antarctica]] linked the frequencies for modes of low and intermediate angular degree, from which the radial orders of the modes could be identified.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983" /&gt;  In addition, new methods of inversion developed, allowing researchers to infer the sound speed profile of the Sun.  Towards the end of the decade, observations also began to show that the oscillation mode frequencies vary with the [[solar cycle|Sun's magnetic activity cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Libbrecht | first1 = K.

To overcome the problem of not being able to observe the Sun at night, several groups had begun to assemble networks of telescopes (e.g. the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]], or BiSON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Aindow | first1 = A. | last2 = Elsworth | first2 = Y.

Long, uninterrupted observations brought the field to maturity, and the state of the field was summarized in a 1996 special issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Science | title = Special Issue: GONG Helioseismology | volume = 272 | issue = 5266 | year = 1996 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/272/5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This coincided with the start of normal operations of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SoHO), which began producing high-quality data for helioseismology.

Space-based observations by SoHO have continued and SoHO was joined in 2010 by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), which has also been monitoring the Sun continuously since its operations began.  In addition, ground-based networks (notably BiSON and GONG) continue to operate, providing nearly continuous data from the ground too.

Within the German Aerospace Center the '''Institute of Aerospace Medicine''' is the only research institution that primarily deals with life science problems concerning space flight, aviation and traffic.


==Research activities==

The Institute's research activities are focussed on the central task of providing for the health and performance of the persons involved (pilot, crew, passenger, astronaut, motorist, resident etc.)
Furthermore, from a medical point of view the development of countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of [[weightlessness]], like the loss of bone and muscle mass, is one of our main tasks to enable long-term stays of humans in space. At the same time, when conducting research under microgravity conditions, basic functions of the human body are examined by eliminating the interfering influence of gravity in a system-physiological approach. In the field of psychology, the selection of qualified personnel (pilots, astronauts, air traffic controllers) and the development of suitable scientific instruments for the selection procedure are another main task of the Institute. Finally, we also deal with the problem of adaptation of life to extreme environments and take part in projects that are concerned with the search for life in space.

==Core tasks and working groups==

===Medical Operations===

Medical Operations is an interdisciplinary field covering aviation, space and travel medicine. Work carried out here includes the study of the physical, physiological, psychological, ergonomic and medical characteristics of air and space travel. The department is also responsible for the health and well-being of flight personnel and passengers and regularly carries out medical examinations on those groups.

===Biomedical Science Support Center===

This division integrates all activities in ME that provide support for ME internal as well as for external scientists in the field of gravity-relevant applications in the biomedical sciences. The profile reaches from scientific and administrational support when planning experiments in [[microgravity]] over concrete experiment preparation and operational support for accepted flight experiments and corresponding ground experiments up to data management. This expertise is also applied in projects of related fields like [[telemedicine]] and ground systems for satellite communications.

===Flight Physiology===

The research activities of the flight physiology division focus on "workload of aviation personnel", "effects of aircraft noise on humans" and within the field of "performance and environment" on basic and special questions about effects of external stressors on humans (e.g. jet-lag, sleep-deprivation, decompression problems in space).

===Aviation and Space Psychology===

The Institute's Department of Aviation and Space Psychology is located in Hamburg and is largely responsible for personnel selection and certain areas of behavioural training for operation staff (pilots, air traffic controllers and astronauts). In April 2002 the Departments' Quality management system was ISO 9001 certified. As the first Q-System worldwide, this certificate covers all stages of psychological diagnostics.

===Radiation Biology===

The Radio Biology Department is concerned with aviation and space relevant questions regarding the effects of radiation on humans and the biosphere. These include, amongst radiation health and protection issues for astronauts and aircraft crews, monitoring the biological consequences of environmental radiation and genotoxic conditions by biological [[dosimetry]] and [[biosensor]]s and [[bioassays]], the assessment of habitability of other planets with special consideration of possible Mars mission scenarios.

===Space Physiology===

The research of space physiology focusses on the influence of weightlessness, nutrition, physical inactivity, unloading, and aging processes on human health. The investigations are performed in an integrative approach - from the cell to the whole organism - on ground and in space.

===Transport Safety===

The working group Transport Safety uses competences and technological innovations from aviation and space research to develop new solutions for problems of road and rail transport.

The '''Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía}}, IAA-CSIC) is a research institute funded by the High Council of Scientific Research of the Spanish government [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC), and is located in [[Granada, Spain|Granada]], [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. IAA activities are related to research in the field of [[astrophysics]], and instrument development both for ground-based [[telescope]]s and for space missions. Scientific research at the Institute covers the [[solar system]], [[star formation]], stellar [[stellar structure|structure]] and [[stellar evolution|evolution]], [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and [[cosmology]]. The IAA was created as a CSIC research institute in July 1975. Presently, the IAA operates the [[Sierra Nevada Observatory]], and (jointly with the also the [[Max-Planck Institute]] of Heidelberg) the [[Calar Alto Observatory]].

The Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía is divided in the following departments, each with an (incomplete) outline of research avenues and groups:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3197">'''Intabulation''', from the Italian word ''intavolatura'', refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[lute]], or other plucked string instrument, written in [[tablature]]. 

==History==
[[File:Codex Faenza-folio37v-De tout flors (Machaut).png|alt=manuscrit musical|thumb|[[Guillaume de Machault]] ''De tout flors'' (intabulation in the ''[[Codex Faenza|Faenza Codex]]'')]]

Intabulation was a common practice in 14th–16th century keyboard and lute music.&lt;ref name=pianohistory&gt;{{cite book |title=Music for Piano, a Short History |last=Kirby |first=F.E. |publisher=Amadeus Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=1995 |isbn=0-931340-86-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument.&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century ''[[Robertsbridge Codex]]'', also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence.&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; Some other early sources of intabulated music are the ''[[Codex Faenza|Faenza Codex]]'' and the Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the ''Buxheim manuscript'' (from the 15th century).&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grovemusic.com |title=Intabulation |work=Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |last=Brown |first=Howard Mayer |editor=L. Macy |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-09-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012046/http://grovemusic.com/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Faenza manuscript'', the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by [[Francesco Landini]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; More than half of its pieces are intabulations.&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; The large ''Buxheim manuscript'' is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including [[John Dunstaple]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Walter Frye]], and [[Guillaume Dufay]].&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; The term "intabulation" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued.&lt;ref name=pianohistory /&gt; The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a [[polyphony|polyphonic piece]], for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added.

Intabulations are an important source of information for [[historically informed performance]] because they show [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] as they would have been played on various instruments, and they are a huge clue as to the actual performance of ''[[musica ficta]]'', since tablature shows where a musician places their fingers, which is less up to interpretation than certain staff notations.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1959 by Dieter Specht and Hans vom Stein in [[Wermelskirchen]], [[Germany]].

Between 1968 and 1973 Interroll concluded [[joint venture]]s in [[France]], [[UK|the UK]], [[Denmark]], [[Benelux|the Benelux countries]] and [[Spain]]. The company developed in the subsequent one as a belt drive used [[Drum Motor|mini-drum motor]], ball [[caster]] and in cooperation with the Italian Rulmeca, severe conveyor rollers for bulk material applications.

1986 the company concentrated all [[injection molding]] production at the newly created site in Sant' Antonino in Switzerland and moved 3 years later the groups headquarter there.

1989 Foundation of the Swiss Holding, establishing the holding.

In 1997, the company went public and floated on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange|Swiss Stock Exchange]]

In 2000, the company founder Dieter Specht, gave the Corporate Executive Board to the new CEO Paul Zumbühl.
Subsequently Zumbühl realigned the group strategically and disposed non-core activities.

In 2013, Interoll took over the US-company Portec, Inc. in [[Canõn City, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interroll Holding AG: Annual Report 2015|url=https://www.interroll.com/fileadmin/user_upload/press/Investor_Relations_and_Press/Interroll_Geschaeftsbericht_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Judenporzellan''' (literally "Jewish Porcelain") is a designation for inferior [[porcelain]] produced by the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]] owned by [[Frederick the Great]] in the late 18th century. In order to increase business, he decreed in 1769 that a tax on Jews in the form of coerced purchases from his factory would be levied on Jews in order to obtain marriage, death, business and other certificates and permits (Glueck 1998). Some accounts claim that the twenty porcelain monkeys belonging to the heirs of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) are Judenporzellan (Hartmann 2006), although some authorities doubt the authenticity of these family stories based on chronology and provenance—at least one of the monkeys is of [[Meissen]] manufacture (Todd 2003).

'''Lawrence University''' is a liberal arts college and conservatory of music in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], United States. Founded in 1847, the school held its first classes on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college in the United States to be founded as a [[coeducational]] institution. 

In a study by the [[National Science Foundation]], Lawrence ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctorates in science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/|title=National Science Foundation, Baccalaureate Origins of U.S.-trained S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence is consistently ranked in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/lawrence-university-3856| title =Lawrence University; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
The {{convert|84|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} campus is located in downtown Appleton, divided into two parts by the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. The academic campus is on the north shore of the river, and the major athletic facilities (including the 5000-seat Banta Bowl) are on the southeast shore. Lawrence also has a {{convert|425|acre|ha|sing=on}} northern estate called [[Björklunden]] (full name: Björklunden vid sjön), which serves as a site for retreats, seminars, concerts, and theatrical performances.  It contains a chapel for weddings.  Donald and Winifred Boynton of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]], donated the property in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]] to Lawrence in 1963.

===Campus development===
In the mid-1980s, the Physics Department built a $330,000 small laser laboratory (known as the "laser palace"), which includes 800 5&amp;nbsp;mW small lasers and more than 500 mirrors.

In 2009, Lawrence opened the Richard and Margot Warch Campus Center, a gathering place for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests from the Fox Cities community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/s/warch_campus_center/about |title=About the Campus Center |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 107,000 square foot building is situated on the Fox River on the site of the former Hulburt House. The Warch Campus Center includes a cinema, campus dining services, campus mailboxes, and various meeting and event spaces. The building has earned a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for meeting sustainability goals in energy conservation, environmental friendliness, and green building.

The college has a long history of razing buildings on its campus, because of the limited land available for constructing new buildings. Many buildings on campus are built on the site of former buildings. Some razed buildings include:
* Peabody Hall of Music (20th century)
* Hamar Union (1960)
* Underwood Observatory (1962)
* Alexander Gym I (1962)
* Carnegie Library (1964)
* Worcester Art Center (1987)
* Stephenson Hall of Science (1998)
* Hulbert House (2006) (new construction: Warch Campus Center, 2009)

==History==
Lawrence's first president, William Harkness Sampson, founded the school with [[Henry R. Colman]], using $10,000 provided by [[philanthropist]] [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], and matched by the [[Methodist]] church. Both founders were ordained Methodist [[minister of religion|ministers]], but Lawrence was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. The school was originally named '''Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin''' in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but the name was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/library/archives/history.shtml |title=Lawrence History &amp;#124; Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also  Charles Breunig’s book, A Great and Good Work: A History of Lawrence University, 1847-1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its oldest extant building, [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], was built in 1853.&lt;ref name=hcap&gt;Council of Independent Colleges, "[http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p976 Main Hall]", Historic Campus Architecture Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence University was the second coeducational institution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/president |title=President Mark Burstein |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence University |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the tenure of [[alumnus]] [[Samuel G. Plantz]] as president. From 1894 to 1924, when Plantz presided over the school, its student body grew from 200 to 800.

From 1913 until 1964, the school was named '''Lawrence College''', to emphasize its small size and [[liberal arts]] education focus. The name was changed to Lawrence University when it merged with [[Milwaukee-Downer College]]. The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women. This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred "on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges" and the university by-laws still make the distinction.

During [[World War II]], Lawrence College was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="lawrence-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |title=Call to Duty, Lawrence University's V-12 Program |publisher=Outagamie County Historical Society (OCHS) |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208022740/http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as "the Con", was founded in 1874.  Lawrence offers two degrees: a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Music]]. It also offers a five-year dual degree program, where students can receive both B.A. and B.Mus. degrees. 

Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two-term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music. President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for implementing the program. The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freshman Studies History|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/freshman_studies/history|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Lawrence University initiated a capital campaign called "More Light!", which aimed at raising $150 million. By October 2011 the college had raised $160,272,839, with the conclusion event held on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/mlfinale/2011/10/photos-from-the-more-light-finale-celebration.html |title=Photos From the More Light! Finale Celebration « More Light Finale |publisher=Blogs.lawrence.edu |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence University is part of the [[Oberlin Group]], a consortium of liberal arts college libraries.

===Milwaukee-Downer traditions===
[[File:Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cupola on [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]] at Lawrence University is an Appleton landmark.]]
The [[traditions]] and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the [[sundial]] on the back of [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner.

The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the "Dean of Downer", but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the "Dean of Downer" came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions. For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of "Downer College of Lawrence University" and upon men in the name of "Lawrence College of Lawrence University"; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of "Lawrence &amp; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University." (The B.Mus. degree is from "the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)

==Academics==
[[File:muddlib.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seeley G. Mudd Library. The library contains over 420,000 volumes.]]
Lawrence University operates on a [[Academic term|trimester]] calendar. The academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June. The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |title=International Resources - Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511013306/http://lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees, with a [[double degree]] possible. Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs in areas such as [[engineering]], [[health sciences]] and [[environmental studies]].

The college offers majors in most of the [[liberal arts]]. The school also offers the option of [[interdisciplinary]] areas of study and allows students to design their own majors.  All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of study and provides a common academic experience for the college. Lawrence's freshman studies program focuses on a mixture of Great Books and more contemporary, influential works. The 2013–2014 list included Plato's ''Republic'' and Alison Bechdel's ''Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic''.

The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses. This allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence’s classes or to explore topics more deeply. Over 90% of the students take advantage of the independent study program.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Conservatory of Music===
The [[Lawrence University Conservatory of Music]] was founded in 1874 and has been a part of Lawrence University ever since. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Music degrees in Performance, Theory/Composition, Music Education, and a five-year double degree option that grants both a BM degree from the Conservatory and a BA degree from the College.  Approximately 25% of the Lawrence student body, or 350 students, is in the Conservatory. The Conservatory has three choirs, two bands, two jazz ensembles, a symphony orchestra, an improvisation collective, five world music ensembles, and numerous chamber music groups.

==Student body==
[[File:Hietthall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hiett Hall, a dormitory]]
Lawrence enrolls about 1,500 students who hail from nearly every U.S. state. The total enrollment in academic year 2010-2011 was 1,566 students,&lt;ref name=2010profile&gt;As of Fall 2010. {{cite web | title = 2010 Profile | publisher = Lawrence University | url = http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120511014100/http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | archivedate = May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest student body in Lawrence University's history. Over 75% of the students identify as white.&lt;ref name=2010profile/&gt;  About 12% are [[international student]]s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"/&gt; About 25% of students study in the conservatory of music.  In the fall of 2014, a quarter of the incoming class were domestic students of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hail to the Class of 2018: Lawrence Welcomes More than 400 New Students|url=https://blogs.lawrence.edu/news/2014/09/hail-to-the-class-of-2018-lawrence-welcomes-more-than-400-new-students.html|date=2014-09-09|accessdate=2014-12-02|work= Lawrence University News Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student traditions==
At the beginning of every academic year in September, incoming freshmen arrive a week before returning students to partake in Welcome Week. During Welcome Week, various activities are planned in order to help the incoming class get to know one another and to help them acclimate to college life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first night of Welcome Week, students and their parents attend the President's Welcome, which concludes with the traditional matriculation handshake, where every member of the incoming class shakes hands and exchanges words with the university's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fall term, the on-campus fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]] hosts the annual Beach Bash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |last1=Denault|first1=Ethan|title=Y’all gonna make me act a fool|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213703/http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |archivedate=24 March 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this event, the brothers of Beta Theta Pi shovel approximately 14 tons of sand into the fraternity house basement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Hannah|title=Senator Tim Kaine campaigns on campus, pushes early voting|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/1009298|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and install a boardwalk and a lifeguard station that doubles as a DJ booth.

During Spring Term, Lawrence University hosts a music festival, LU-aroo (a play on words on the popular music festival [[Bonnaroo]]). Held on the quad, the festival features many talented student bands, both from the college and the conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senye|first1=Yame|title=LUAROO|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/admissions-studentstories/2014/05/luaroo.html|website=Lawrence University Student Stories|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musician [[The Tallest Man on Earth]] played at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyman|first1=Shane|title=LU to host Tallest Man on Earth|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/04/05/lu-host-tallest-man-earth/82656062/|website=The Post-Crescent|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the university's Spring Term, many seniors participate in the Senior Streak, which typically happens during the eighth week of the term.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Editorial: Senior streak re-revisited|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/108681|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the senior streak is to provide seniors with one last opportunity to let loose before finals, graduation, and post-college life.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Although rumor says that the senior streak was created as a result of former president [[Richard Warch]]'s aversion to the activity, this has been proven to be false.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Students, often coming from Lawrence's on-campus bar, the Viking Room, strip their clothes and run around the area of Main Hall, as one last hurrah before finals and graduation.

==Media==
The student newspaper, ''[[The Lawrentian]]'', has been published for over a century. 

Lawrence University hosts the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], webcast every January over the college radio station, [[WLFM]].

== Education and early career ==
Born in [[Hasselt]], Bertels received a Masters' degree in Musicology from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]] (Belgium), followed by a Masters' degree in Composition from [[Durham University]]  - [[Collingwood College, Durham|Collingwood College]] (UK). He subsequently engaged in PhD research on Mimesis in Music Recording at [[University of Surrey|Surrey University]] (UK), whilst working as a [[Tonmeister]] and record producer.

== RITCS Film, Radio and TV School ==
From 1994, Bertels started lecturing at the RITCS (then RITS) Film, Radio and TV School in Brussels, teaching subjects including audio technology, music recording, audio art, sound for animation movies and acoustics. He continued to teach at RITCS until his departure to Australia in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/uploads-2014/Lieven%20Bertels%20Bio.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== VRT and Concertgebouw Brugge ==
Since 1998 Bertels worked as a researcher and a producer for Belgian national broadcaster VRT, both for the cultural TV Channel Canvas and for Cultural radio channel Klara (formerly Radio 3). In 2001 Bertels was invited to become the first artistic director of the Concertgebouw Brugge ([[Bruges]], Belgium), a new multi-room arts venue purpose-built for Bruges 2002 [[European Capital of Culture]]. Bertels' programming was noticed for its eclectic mix of genres and artists, which pushed the Concertgebouw on the international stage with coproductions including [[Heiner Goebbels]].

In [[physiology]], [[psychology]], or [[psychophysics]], a '''limen''' or a '''liminal point''' is a [[sensory threshold|threshold]] of a physiological or psychological response. It is the boundary of perception. On one side of a limen (or threshold) a stimulus is perceivable, on the other side it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jameson K. |last1=Holden|first2= Eric M. |last2=Francisco|first3= Zheng |last3=Zhang|first4=Cristina |last4=Baric|first5= Mark |last5=Tommerdahl|title=An Undergraduate Laboratory Exercise to Study Weber’s Law|journal=Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71-74|date=2011|pmid=23493843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liminal''', as an adjective, means situated at a sensory threshold, hence barely perceptible. Subliminal means below perception.
The [[absolute threshold]] is the lowest amount of sensation detectable by a sense organ.

==History ==

MEST was announced in 2007, when [[Meltwater Group|Meltwater]] announced plans to establish an entrepreneurial training program in Africa. The school opened in February 2008 with the first class of Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconafrica.com/meltwater-incubator-a-year-in-review/|title=A Year in Review at Meltwater Incubator in Accra - Ghana|publisher=Silicon Africa|first=Monica|last=Jamaluddin|date=23 January 2013|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the first class of EITs graduated and the MEST [[Business incubator|Incubator]] was launched with [[seed funding]] for incubator companies started by the first group of EITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/out-of-africa-a-whole-mest-of-startups-emerges-in-ghana/|title=Out of Africa - A Whole MEST of Startups Emerges in Ghana|publisher=TechCrunch|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=14 June 2012|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, MEST partnered with [[Vodafone Ghana]] to sponsor a 48-hour hackathon to help develop access to information, simplify transactions and shorten business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/01/mest-partners-vodafone-ghana-hackathon/|title=MEST Partners Vodafone Ghana for Hackathon|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=28 January 2015 |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/social/vodafone-mest-hackathon-app-developer-competition-finalised--101941|title=Vodafone, MEST Hackathon App Developer Competition Finalised|publisher=Ghana News Agency|date= 24 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the school was recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative companies of Africa by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].&lt;ref name=fast&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041821/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-africa|title=The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Africa|publisher=Fast Company|date=9 February 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST announced a partnership with [[Samsung]] in April 2015. As part of the agreement, Samsung provided subsidized devices and internship positions, as well as marketing services and mobile application distribution, in exchange for the opportunity to invest in MEST companies through its Samsung Enterprise Business Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/04/mest-partners-samsung-to-support-west-african-startups/|title=MEST Partners Samsung to Support West African Startups|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=23 April 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST hosted the first Africa Technology Summit in November 2015 in Accra, Ghana, the event featured panels and keynote presentations from a variety of global and African businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyafrique.com/african-technology-summit-ats-2015-accra-ghana/|title=African Technology Summit (ATS) 2015, Accra Ghana|publisher=Tech Afrique|date=12 August 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neath abbey, Glamorgan - founded by Richard De Cranville, circa 1129.jpeg|thumb|Neath abbey, 1849]]
'''Neath Abbey''' ({{lang-cy|Abaty Nedd}}) was a [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]], located near the present-day town of [[Neath]] in [[South Wales]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was once the largest [[abbey]] in [[Wales]]. Substantial ruins can still be seen, and are in the care of [[Cadw]]. [[Tudor period|Tudor]] historian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] called Neath Abbey "the fairest abbey of all Wales."

Neath Abbey is also the name of an area of Neath near to the abbey ruins.

== History ==
[[Image:Neath abbey.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Neath Abbey]]
Neath Abbey was established in 1129 AD when [[Richard I de Grenville]] (d.post 1142), one of the [[Twelve Knights of Glamorgan]], gave {{convert|8000|acre}} of his estate in [[Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], to [[Savigniac]] [[monk]]s from western [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name=ggat&gt;{{Watprn|GGAT|00585w|title=Neath Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first monks arrived in 1130. Following the assumption of the Savigniac order into the [[Cistercian]] order in 1147, Neath Abbey also became a Cistercian house. The abbey was ravaged by the Welsh uprisings of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=coflein&gt;{{Watprn|coflein|133|title=Neath Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by King [[Henry VIII of England]] the last abbot, [[Lleision ap Thomas]], managed to buy time through payment of a large fine in 1536, but the abbey was dissolved in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-LLEI-THO-1513.html|title=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion |last=Saunders |first=Evan John|year=1970|chapter=Lleision ap Thomas|accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the abbey was turned into a large estate, initially granted to Richard Williams, although by 1600 it was owned by [[John Herbert (Secretary of State)|Sir John Herbert]], and had a substantial Tudor mansion occupying a part of the cloisters. The mansion itself was only habitable for 100 years or so, before being abandoned as the site became a scene of industry.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;

==Industrial use==
By 1730, some of the buildings were being used for [[copper smelting]], and the rest were abandoned. In the late 18th century, an [[iron foundry]] was opened near the abbey ruins by a company owned by the Price, [[Fox family of Falmouth|Fox]] and Tregelles families. The ruined walls of both the Abbey and later mansion were gradually engulfed in quantities of industrial waste. The ownership of the site passed to the Rice family, [[Baron Dynevor|Barons Dynevor]], and it was in the 1920s, under [[Walter FitzUryan Rice, 7th Baron Dynevor]] that a local group of amateur archaeologists began the process of uncovering the medieval ruins.&lt;ref name=nas/&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[Image:NeathAbbey.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Neath Abbey]]
The [[archaeology]] of the abbey was eventually excavated between 1924 and 1935. The Neath Antiquarian Society was the driving force in this early archaology, in which 7,000 tons of slag and other industrial waste were removed by hand, to uncover the abbey ruins.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/neathantiquariansociety/index.asp?pageid=637090|title=The Neath Abbey Research Party|website=Neath Antiquarian Society|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the ownership passed to the Ministry of Works, who undertook further stabilization of the walls. In 2014 [[Cadw]], the successor body charged with the sites care, began a substantial project to further protect and stabilize parts of the ruins. The site is open to the public with some interpretation display boards on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/neathabbeyandgatehouse/?lang=en|website=Cadw, the Welsh Government's historic environment service|title=Neath Abbey and Gatehouse|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gatehouse==
North of the abbey ruins are the remains of the gatehouse which would have controlled access into the abbey precinct. It now stands on New Road alongside the playground of Abbey Primary School. It was originally built around 1130, but the most prominent surviving features, two pointed windows that face onto the road, date from the 13th or 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{watprn|GGAT|00587w|title=Neath Abbey Gatehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commercial use ==
The area adjacent to the ruins is used by a car retailer and a number of smaller businesses and workshops.

The site has been used to film several episodes of television series [[Doctor Who]]. The Time Lord (played by [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and his companion [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) have filmed several times at the site, which was transformed into a complete structure.

The site was also used for shots during the filming of the BBC television series Merlin, for example the castle of the ancient kings where Arthur rediscovered the round table in Series 3 episode 13

'''One World Archaeology''' is a book series focussing on archaeology and education about the past. 

==About the Series==
One World Archaeology is one of five book series associated with the [[World Archaeological Congress]] (WAC). Editors and contributors to these series waive any royalties, allowing all royalties to be used to further the work of the WAC. "Publications in the One World Archaeology series contain selections of the papers presented at the WAC Congresses, held every four years. This series developed as an outcome of the inaugural World Archaeological Congress held in Southampton, England in 1986. The subject matter of this series is wide-ranging, reflecting the diverse interests of WAC. WAC gives place to considerations of power and politics in framing archaeological questions and results. WAC also gives place and privilege to minorities who have often been silenced or regarded as beyond capable of making main line contributions to the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldarch.org/publications/|title=Publications|date=23 May 2015|website=worldarch.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other four series are Worlds of Archaeology, Indigenous Archaeologies, Global Cultural Heritage Manual Series, and Research Handbooks in Archaeology

{{confused|OpenDocument}}
In [[semiotic]] analysis (the studies of signs or symbols), an '''open text''' is a text that allows multiple or mediated [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] by the readers.  In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.

The concept of the '''open text''' comes from [[Umberto Eco]]'s collection of essays ''The Role of the Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U., 1984,The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also derivative of [[Roland Barthes]]'s distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, "[[The Death of the Author]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, R., 1977, 'The Death of the Author' in Image-Music-Text, Fontana&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
In this essay, [[Umberto Eco]] describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of "open works" to literary texts and other works of art.

Every work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the [[Anagoge|anagogical]]. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.

The reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] , which are "open" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.

[[Umberto Eco]] makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are "open" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of "openness" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)

This kind of "openness" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.

He continues by comparing open works to [[Quantum mechanics]], and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges  the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.

Every work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a "work in movement", an "open work" and still a "work in progress".

{{short description|Part of most types of flower}}
[[Image:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram showing the parts of a mature flower. In this example the perianth is separated into a calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals)]]

'''Petals''' are modified [[Leaf|leaves]] that surround the reproductive parts of [[flower]]s. They are often [[advertising coloration|brightly colored]] or unusually shaped to attract [[pollinator]]s. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a '''''corolla'''''. Petals are usually accompanied by another set of special leaves called [[sepal]]s, that collectively form the ''calyx'' and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the [[perianth]]. When the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish, they are collectively called [[tepal]]s. Examples of plants in which the term ''tepal'' is appropriate include [[Genus|genera]] such as ''[[Aloe]]'' and ''[[Tulipa]]''. Conversely, genera such as ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' and ''[[Phaseolus]]'' have well-distinguished sepals and petals. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as "petaloid", as in [[petaloid monocots]], orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include [[Liliales]], an alternative name is lilioid monocots.

Although petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers, wind-pollinated species, such as the [[Poaceae|grasses]], either have very small petals or lack them entirely.

}}

==Corolla==
[[File:2007 brugmansia aurea.jpg|thumb|Corolla forming a tube with long points (and a separate green calyx tube)]]
The role of the corolla in plant [[evolution]] has been studied extensively since [[Charles Darwin]] postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Anders Nilsson| title=The evolution of flowers with deep corolla tubes |journal=Nature |volume=334 |issue=6178 |pages=147–149 |year=1988 |doi=10.1038/334147a0 |bibcode=1988Natur.334..147N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corolla of separate tepals is ''apopetalous''. If the petals are free from one another in the corolla, the plant is ''polypetalous'' or ''choripetalous''; while if the petals are at least partially fused together, it is ''gamopetalous'' or ''sympetalous''. In the case of fused tepals, the term is ''syntepalous''. The corolla in some plants forms a tube.

== Variations ==
[[File:Pelargonium peltatum 9245s.jpg|thumb|''Pelargonium peltatum'': its floral structure is almost identical to that of geraniums, but it is conspicuously zygomorphic]]
[[File:Geranium incanum 9156s.jpg|left|thumb|''Geranium incanum'', with an actinomorphic flower typical of the genus]] [[File:White pea flower.jpg|thumb|White pea, a zygomorphic flower]]
[[File:20140226Narcissus pseudonarcissus2.jpg|thumb|''Narcissus pseudonarcissus'', showing from the bend to the tip of the flower: [[spathe]], [[floral cup]], [[tepal]]s, [[perianth#corona|corona]]]]
Petals can differ dramatically in different species.  The [[merosity|number of petals in a flower]] may hold clues to a plant's classification.  For example, flowers on [[eudicots]] (the largest group of [[dicotyledon|dicots]]) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on [[monocotyledon|monocots]] have three or six petals, although there are many exceptions to this rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The origin and diversification of angiosperms |author= Soltis, Pamela S.|authorlink = Pamela S. Soltis|author2 = Douglas E. Soltis |journal= American Journal of Botany |year= 2004 |volume= 91 | pages= 1614–1626 |url= http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1614 | doi= 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1614 |issue=10 |pmid=21652312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical (see [[Symmetry in biology]] and [[Floral symmetry]]).  If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be '''regular''' or '''actinomorphic''' (meaning "ray-formed"). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed '''irregular''' or '''zygomorphic''' (meaning "yoke-" or "pair-formed"). In ''irregular'' flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the ''regular'' form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of [[Floral symmetry|zygomorphic]] flowers may be seen in [[orchid]]s and members of the [[Fabaceae|pea family]].

In many plants of the [[Asteraceae|aster family]] such as the sunflower, ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'', the circumference of the [[Head (botany)|flower head]] is composed of ray florets.  Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal.  Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ('''[[hypanthium]]''') above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p. 365}}{{sfn|Foster|2014|loc=[http://plant-phytography.blogspot.ca/2012/10/hypanthium-cup-shaped-or-tubular.html Hypanthium]}}&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;

Petal often consists of two parts: the upper, broad part, similar to leaf blade, also called the ''blade'' and the lower part, narrow, similar to leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], called the ''claw'', separated from each other at the ''limb''. Claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family ''[[Brassicaceae]]'', such as ''[[Erysimum cheiri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=Flower|url=http://eb11.co.uk/index.php?p=FLOWER35747-h.htm|first=|last=|volume=10: Evangelical Church – Francis Joseph I.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception and further development of petals shows a great variety of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1973. ''Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas''. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators, and are variously known as [[nectar guide]]s, pollen guides, and floral guides.

==Genetics==
The genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the [[ABC Model of Flower Development|ABC model of flower development]], are that sepals, petals, [[stamen]]s, and [[carpels]] are modified versions of each other.  It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.3732/ajb.0800038 |title= One size fits all?

==Significance of pollination==
Pollination is an important step in the sexual reproduction of higher plants.  Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of [[monoecious|hermaphroditic]] flowers.

Pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the [[stigma (botany)]] of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong.

==Functions and purposes==
Petals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant. In general, petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators.

===Function===
This is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g. the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar. Pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate.&lt;ref&gt;Cares-Suarez, R,  Poch, T, Acevedo, R.F, Acosta-Bravo, I, Pimentel, C,  Espinoza, C, Cares, R.A, Munoz, P, Gonzalez, A.V, Botto-Mahan, C (2011) Do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory?: An experimental assessment in Loasa tricolor (Loasaceae). Gayana Botanica, Volume 68, Pages 176-181&lt;/ref&gt; Using incentives flowers draw pollinators and set up a mutual relation between each other in which case the pollinators will remember to always guard and pollinate these flowers (unless incentives are not consistently met and competition prevails).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chamberlain S.A |author2=Rudgers J.A | year = 2012 | title = How do plants balance multiple mutualists?

===Scent===
The petals could produce different scents to allure desirable pollinators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toh|first=Conie|last2=Mohd-Hairul|first2=Ab. Rahim|last3=Ain|first3=Nooraini Mohd.|last4=Namasivayam|first4=Parameswari|last5=Go|first5=Rusea|last6=Abdullah|first6=Nur Ashikin Psyquay|last7=Abdullah|first7=Meilina Ong|last8=Abdullah|first8=Janna Ong|date=2017-11-02|title=Floral micromorphology and transcriptome analyses of a fragrant Vandaceous Orchid, Vanda Mimi Palmer, for its fragrance production sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2872-6|journal=BMC Research Notes|volume=10|pages=554|doi=10.1186/s13104-017-2872-6|issn=1756-0500}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repel undesirable pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Danny|last2=Kallenbach|first2=Mario|last3=Diezel|first3=Celia|last4=Rothe|first4=Eva|last5=Murdock|first5=Mark|last6=Baldwin|first6=Ian T|date=2015-07-01|title=Abstract|url=https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07641.001|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=4|doi=10.7554/elife.07641.001|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flowers will also mimic the scents produced by materials such as decaying meat, to attract pollinators to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=More, M, Cocucci, A.A, Raguso, R.A|year=2013|title=The importance of oligosulfides in the attraction of fly pollinators to the brood-site deceptive species ''Jaborosa rotacea'' (Solanaceae)|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=174|pages=863–876|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/670367?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102751669991|doi=10.1086/670367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
Various colour traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities, or that only come out at certain parts of the day. Some flowers are able to change the colour of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away.&lt;ref name=SLH&gt;Science Learning Hub. (2012). The University of Waikato. "Attracting pollinators". Date Retrieved: August 2013. [http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Pollination/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/Attracting-pollinators]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape and size===
Furthermore, the shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need. For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
Collectively the scent, colour and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
In some petals, a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed, stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw, and a wider distal part referred to as the blade (or limb). Often the claw and blade are at an angle with one another.

==Types of pollination==

===Wind pollination===
{{main|Anemophily}}
Wind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2406479?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102845746923|title=Wind Pollination in the Angiosperms: Evolutionary and Environmental Considerations|author=Donald R. Whitehead|journal=Evolution|volume=23|issue=1|year=1969|pages=28–35|doi=10.2307/2406479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attracting insects===
Flowers have various regulatory mechanisms in order to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pōhutukawa (''Metrosideros excelsa'') which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The pōhutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;
Another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scent which is highly attractive towards humans such as the rose, but some are very fragrant within attracting flies as they have a smell of rotting meat. Dark is another factor in which flowers have grown to adapt these conditions so colour lacks vision at night therefore scent is the solution for flowers which are pollinated by night flying insects such as the moth.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;

===Attracting birds===
Flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery. Such bird–pollinated native plants include: Kōwhai (''Sophora'' species), flax (''Phormium tenax'', harakeke) and kākā beak (''Clianthus puniceus'', kōwhai ngutu-kākā). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (''Fuchsia excorticata'', kōtukutuku) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower.&lt;ref name=SLH/&gt;

===Bat-pollinated flowers===
Flowers can be pollinated by short tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (''Dactylanthus taylorii''). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing lots of nectar and a very strong scent. These act as a very useful mechanism in attracting the bat.&lt;ref&gt;Physics.org (2012). University of Adelaide. "Flightless parrots, burrowing bats helped parasitic Hades flower". Date Retrieved August 2013. [http://phys.org/news/2012-10-flightless-parrots-burrowing-parasitic-hades.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polygonum amphibium (4973671699).jpg|thumb|200px|right|This above-ground stem of ''[[Polygonatum]]'' has lost its leaves, but is producing [[adventitious roots]] from the nodes.]]
{{About|the stem part of a plant|the use of stem node in phylogenetics and cladistics|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}
A '''stem''' is one of two main structural axes of a [[vascular plant]], the other being the [[root]]. The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes:
* The nodes hold one or more leaves, as well as [[bud]]s which can grow into branches (with [[leaf|leaves]], [[conifer cone]]s, or [[inflorescence]]s (flowers)). [[Adventitious roots]] may also be produced from the nodes.
* The internodes distance one node from another.

The term "[[shoot]]s" is often confused with "stems"; "shoots" generally refers to new fresh plant growth including both stems and other structures like leaves or flowers. In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have [[underground stems]].

Stems have four main functions which are:&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Peter H., Ray Franklin Evert, and Helena Curtis. 1981. ''Biology of plants.'' New York, N.Y.: Worth Publishers.{{ISBN|0-87901-132-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for and the elevation of leaves, [[flower]]s and [[fruit]]s. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.
* Transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]
* Storage of nutrients
* Production of new living tissue. The normal lifespan of plant cells is one to three years. Stems have cells called [[meristem]]s that annually generate new living tissue.

== Specialized terms ==
Stems are often specialized for storage, asexual reproduction, protection or photosynthesis, including the following:
* [[Glossary of botanical terms#A|Acaulescent]] – used to describe stems in plants that appear to be stemless. Actually these stems are just extremely short, the leaves appearing to rise directly out of the ground, e.g. some [[Viola (plant)|''Viola'']] species.
* Arborescent – tree like with woody stems normally with a single trunk.
* [[Axillary bud]] – a bud which grows at the point of attachment of an older leaf with the stem. It potentially gives rise to a shoot. 
* [[Branch]]ed – aerial stems are described as being branched or unbranched
* [[Bud]] – an embryonic shoot with immature stem tip.
* [[Bulb]] – a short vertical underground stem with fleshy storage leaves attached, e.g. [[onion]], [[daffodil]], [[tulip]]. Bulbs often function in reproduction by splitting to form new bulbs or producing small new bulbs termed bulblets. Bulbs are a combination of stem and leaves so may better be considered as leaves because the leaves make up the greater part.
* Caespitose – when stems grow in a tangled mass or clump or in low growing mats.
* Cladode (including [[phylloclade]]) – a flattened stem that appears more-or-less leaf like and is specialized for photosynthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goebel, K.E.v. |origyear=1905|year=1969 |title= Organography of plants, especially of the Archegoniatae and Spermaphyta|publisher=Hofner publishing company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. [[cactus]] pads.
* [[Vine|Climbing]] – stems that cling or wrap around other plants or structures.
* [[Corm]] – a short enlarged underground, storage stem, e.g. [[taro]], [[crocus]], [[gladiolus]].
[[File:Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semillería_Costanzi_-_vine_detail_decumbent_shoot_and_tendril.jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|Decumbent stem in ''[[Cucurbita maxima]]''.]]
* Decumbent – stems that lie flat on the ground and turn upwards at the ends.
* Fruticose – stems that grow shrublike with woody like habit.
* [[Herbaceous]] – non woody, they die at the end of the growing season.
* Internode – an interval between two successive nodes. It possesses the ability to elongate, either from its base or from its extremity depending on the species.
* Node – a point of attachment of a leaf or a [[twig]] on the stem in seed plants. A node is a very small growth zone.
* [[Pedicel (botany)|Pedicel]] – stems that serve as the stalk of an individual flower in an [[inflorescence]] or [[infrutescence]].
* [[Peduncle (botany)|Peduncle]] – a stem that supports an [[inflorescence]]
* [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Prickle]] – a sharpened extension of the stem's outer layers, e.g. [[rose]]s.
* {{anchor|pseudostem}}Pseudostem – a false stem made of the rolled bases of leaves, which may be 2 or 3 m tall as in [[banana]]
* [[Rhizome]] – a horizontal underground stem that functions mainly in reproduction but also in storage, e.g. most [[fern]]s, [[iris (plant)|iris]]
* [[Runner (plant part)]] – a type of stolon, horizontally growing on top of the ground and rooting at the nodes, aids in reproduction. e.g. [[garden strawberry]], ''[[Chlorophytum comosum]]''.
* [[Scape (botany)|Scape]] – a stem that holds flowers that comes out of the ground and has no normal leaves. [[Hosta]], [[Lily]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Garlic]].
* [[Stolon]] – a horizontal stem that produces rooted plantlets at its nodes and ends, forming near the surface of the ground.
* [[Thorn (botany)|Thorn]] – a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] with a sharpened point.
* [[Tuber]] – a swollen, underground storage stem adapted for storage and reproduction, e.g. [[potato]].
* [[Woody plant|Woody]] – hard textured stems with secondary xylem.

== Stem structure ==
[[Image:Labeledstemforposter copy new.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Flax]] stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues. Ep = [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = [[bast fibre]]s; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]
{{See also|Stele (biology)}}

Stem usually consist of three tissues, [[Epidermis (botany)|dermal tissue]], [[ground tissue]] and [[vascular tissue]]. The dermal tissue covers the outer surface of the stem and usually functions to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of parenchyma cells and fills in around the vascular tissue. It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. Vascular tissue provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the vascular tissues varies widely among plant species.

=== Dicot stems ===
[[Dicot]] stems with primary growth have [[pith]] in the center, with vascular bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The outside of the stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain [[stomata]] for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called [[trichomes]]. A cortex consisting of [[hypodermis]] (collenchyma cells) and [[endodermis]] (starch containing cells) is present above the [[pericycle]] and vascular bundles.

Woody dicots and many nonwoody dicots have [[secondary growth]] originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the [[vascular cambium]] and the [[cork cambium]] or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects to form a continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce [[secondary xylem]] to the inside and [[secondary phloem]] to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the [[periderm]], which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.

Secondary [[xylem]] is commercially important as [[wood]]. The seasonal variation in growth from the [[vascular cambium]] is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings are the basis of [[dendrochronology]], which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. [[Dendroclimatology]] is the use of tree rings as a record of past climates. The aerial stem of an adult [[tree]] is called a [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the [[heartwood]] and is the result of [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]]. The outer, living wood is termed the sapwood.

=== Monocot stems ===
[[File:Royal Palm Trunk.jpg|250px|thumb |right |Stems of two ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' palms showing characteristic bulge, leaf scars and fibrous roots, [[Kolkata, India]] ]]

Vascular bundles are present throughout the [[monocot]] stem, although concentrated towards the outside. This differs from the dicot stem that has a ring of vascular bundles and often none in the center. The shoot apex in monocot stems is more elongated. Leaf sheathes grow up around it, protecting it. This is true to some extent of almost all monocots. Monocots rarely produce [[secondary growth]] and are therefore seldom woody, with [[Arecaceae|Palms]] and [[Bamboo]] being notable exceptions. However, many monocot stems increase in diameter via anomalous secondary growth.

=== Gymnosperm stems ===
[[Image:Redwood M D Vaden.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The trunk of this [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] tree is its stem.]]
[[Image:Ferns.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Tasmanian]] [[tree fern]]]]

All [[gymnosperms]] are woody plants. Their stems are similar in structure to woody dicots except that most gymnosperms produce only [[tracheid]]s in their xylem, not the vessels found in dicots. Gymnosperm wood also often contains [[resin]] ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. [[oak]], [[maple]] and [[walnut]]. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as [[pine]], [[spruce]] and [[fir]].

=== Fern stems ===
Most [[fern]]s have [[rhizome]]s with no vertical stem. The exception is [[Cyatheales|tree ferns]], with vertical stems up to about 20 metres. The stem anatomy of ferns is more complicated than that of dicots because fern stems often have one or more leaf gaps in cross section. A leaf gap is where the vascular tissue branches off to a [[frond]]. In cross section, the vascular tissue does not form a complete cylinder where a leaf gap occurs. Fern stems may have [[Stele (biology)|solenosteles]] or [[Stele (biology)|dictyosteles]] or variations of them. Many fern stems have phloem tissue on both sides of the xylem in cross-section.

== Economic importance ==
[[Image:Asparagus produce-1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|White and green [[asparagus]] – crispy stems are the edible parts of this vegetable]]
There are thousands of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as [[potato]] and [[taro]]. [[Sugarcane]] stems are a major source of sugar. [[Maple sugar]] is obtained from trunks of [[maple]] trees. [[Vegetable]]s from stems are [[asparagus]], [[bamboo shoot]]s, cactus pads or [[nopalito]]s, [[kohlrabi]], and [[Eleocharis dulcis|water chestnut]]. The spice, [[cinnamon]] is bark from a tree trunk. [[Gum arabic]] is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'' trees. [[Chicle]], the main ingredient in [[chewing gum]], is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree.

Medicines obtained from stems include [[quinine]] from the bark of [[cinchona]] trees, [[camphor]] distilled from wood of a tree in the same genus that provides cinnamon, and the muscle relaxant [[curare]] from the bark of tropical vines.

[[Wood]] is used in thousands of ways, e.g. [[building material|buildings]], [[furniture]], [[boat]]s, [[airplane]]s, [[wagon]]s, [[car]] parts, [[musical instrument]]s, [[sports equipment]], [[railroad tie]]s, [[utility pole]]s, fence posts, [[Deep foundation|pilings]], [[toothpick]]s, [[match]]es, [[plywood]], [[coffin]]s, [[Shake (shingle)|shingles]], [[barrel]] staves, [[toy]]s, [[tool]] handles, [[picture frame]]s, [[wood veneer|veneer]], [[charcoal]] and [[firewood]]. [[Wood pulp]] is widely used to make [[paper]], [[paperboard]], [[cellulose]] sponges, [[cellophane]] and some important [[plastic]]s and [[textile]]s, such as [[cellulose acetate]] and [[rayon]]. [[Bamboo]] stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, [[fishing pole]]s, [[water pipe]]s, plant stakes, and [[bamboo scaffolding|scaffolding]]. Trunks of [[palm trees]] and [[tree fern]]s are often used for building. Stems of [[Phragmites|Reed]] are an important building material for use in [[thatching]] in some areas.

[[Tannin]]s used for tanning [[leather]] are obtained from the wood of certain trees, such as [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]]. [[Cork (material)|Cork]] is obtained from the bark of the [[cork oak]].  [[Rubber]] is obtained from the trunks of ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]].'' [[Rattan]], used for furniture and baskets, is made from the stems of tropical vining palms. [[Bast fiber]]s for textiles and rope are obtained from stems include [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]] and [[ramie]]. The earliest paper was obtained from the stems of [[papyrus]] by the ancient Egyptians.

[[Amber]] is fossilized sap from tree trunks; it is used for [[jewelry]] and may contain ancient animals. Resins from conifer wood are used to produce [[turpentine]] and [[rosin]]. Tree bark is often used as a [[mulch]] and in growing media for container plants. It also can become the natural [[habitat]] of [[lichen]]s.

Some ornamental plants are grown mainly for their attractive stems, e.g.:
* White bark of [[paper birch]]
* Twisted branches of [[Corkscrew Willow|corkscrew willow]] and [[hazel|Harry Lauder's walking stick]] (''Corylus avellana'' 'Contorta')
* Red, peeling bark of [[paperbark maple]]

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S.

See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.) "[https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O: The PROV Ontology]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; make extensive use of metadata models such as [[Dublin Core]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khalidbelhajjame.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/w3c-prov-implementations/ "W3C PROV Implementations: Preliminary Analysis", Khalid Belhajjame, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several maintained and open-source provenance capture implementation at the operating system level such as CamFlow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://camflow.org/ CamFlow], a [[Linux security module]] by the University of Cambridge and Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquier|first1=Thomas|last2=Han|first2=Xueyuan|last3=Goldstein|first3=Mark|last4=Moyer|first4=Thomas|last5=Eyers|first5=David|last6=Seltzer|first6=Margo|last7=Bacon|first7=Jean|title=Practical Whole-system Provenance Capture|journal=Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing|date=2017|pages=405–418|doi=10.1145/3127479.3129249|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3129249&amp;CFID=815806448&amp;CFTOKEN=34069737|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Progger&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xin|last2=Joshi|first2=Chaitanya|last3=Tan|first3=Alan Yu Shyang|last4=Ko|first4=Ryan Kok Leong|date=August 2015|title=Inferring User Actions from Provenance Logs|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7345350/|journal=2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/trustcom.2015.442|isbn=9781467379526}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Linux and MS Windows, and SPADE for Linux, [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]], and [[MacOS]].&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/ashish-gehani/spade/wiki&lt;/ref&gt; Other implementations exist for specific programming and scripting languages, such as RDataTracker&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/RDataTracker&lt;/ref&gt; for [[R (programming language)|R]], and NoWorkflow&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

{{Wiktionary|relict}}
A '''relict''' is a surviving remnant of a natural phenomenon.

* In [[biology]] a ''relict'' (or relic) is an organism that at an earlier time was abundant in a large area but now occurs at only one or a few small areas.
* In ecology, an [[ecosystem]] which originally ranged over a large expanse, but is now narrowly confined, may be termed a ''relict''.
* In [[geology]], a ''relict'' is a structure or mineral from a parent rock that did not undergo metamorphosis when the surrounding rock did, or a rock that survived a destructive geologic process.
* In [[geomorphology]], a ''relict landform'' is a [[landform]] formed by either erosive or constructive surficial processes that are no longer active as they were in the past.
* In [[agronomy]], a ''relict crop'' is a crop which was previously grown extensively, but is now only used in one limited region, or a small number of isolated regions.
* In [[history]] (as revealed in [[DNA test]]ing), a ''relict population'' is an ancient people in an area who have been largely supplanted by a later group of migrants and their descendants. 
* In [[real estate law]], ''reliction'' is the gradual recession of water from its usual high-water mark so that the newly uncovered land becomes the property of the adjoining [[riparian]] property owner.&lt;ref name="Lear1991a"&gt;Lear, P.W. 1991, ''Accretion, reliction, erosion, and avulsion: a survey of riparian and littoral title problems.'' Journal of Energy, Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Law. vol. 11, pp. 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses:
*In addition, '''relict''' was an ancient term still used in colonial (British) America, and in England of that era, but now archaic, for a [[widow]]; it has come to be a generic or collective term for widows and widowers.
* In [[historical linguistics]], a ''relict'' is a word that is a survivor of a form or forms that are otherwise archaic.

===Human populations===
In various places around the world, minority [[ethnic group]]s represent lineages of ancient [[human migration]]s in places now occupied by more populous ethnic groups, whose ancestors arrived later. For example, the first human groups to inhabit the Caribbean islands were [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes from South and Central America. Genetic testing of natives of Cuba show that, in late pre-Columbian times, the island was home to agriculturalists of [[Taíno people|Taino]] ethnicity. In addition, a relict population of the original hunter-gatherers remained in western Cuba as the [[Ciboney people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''retreat of glaciers since 1850''' affects the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use, mountain recreation, animals and plants that depend on glacier-melt, and, in the longer term, the level of the oceans.  Studied by [[glaciologist]]s, the temporal coincidence of [[glacier]] retreat with the measured increase of atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es is often cited as an evidentiary underpinning of [[global warming]].  Mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the [[Himalayas]], [[Alps]], [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]], and the southern [[Andes]], as well as isolated tropical summits such as [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, are showing some of the largest proportionate glacial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|title=Graph of 20 glaciers in retreat worldwide|work=Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis)|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-18.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Mölg|title=Worldwide glacier retreat|work=RealClimate|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=129|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glacier mass balance]] is the key determinant of the health of a glacier.  If the amount of frozen precipitation in the [[accumulation zone]] exceeds the quantity of glacial ice lost due to melting or in the [[ablation zone]] a glacier will advance; if the accumulation is less than the ablation, the glacier will retreat.  Glaciers in retreat will have negative mass balances, and if they do not find an equilibrium between accumulation and ablation, will eventually disappear.

The [[Little Ice Age]] was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when the world experienced relatively cooler temperatures compared to the present.  Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed substantially.  Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed temporarily, in many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as global temperatures [[:File:Global monthly temperature record.png|cooled slightly]].&lt;ref name=pelto1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelto|first=Mauri|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1980, a significant [[global warming]] has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether, and the existences of many of the remaining glaciers are threatened.  In locations such as the Andes of South America and Himalayas in Asia, the demise of glaciers in these regions has the potential to affect water supplies in those areas.

The retreat of mountain glaciers, notably in western North America, Asia, the Alps and [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of South America, Africa and [[Indonesia]], provide evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Intergovernmental panel on climate change|title=2.2.5.4 Mountain glaciers|work=Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901175741/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm|archivedate=September 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Snow and Ice Data Center|title=Global glacier recession|work=GLIMS Data at NSIDC|url=http://nsidc.org/data/glims/glaciermelt/index.html|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705060036/http://nsidc.org/data/glims/glaciermelt/index.html|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of key [[outlet glacier]]s of the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet|West Antarctic]] [[ice sheet]]s may foreshadow a [[sea level rise|rise in sea level]], which would affect coastal regions.

==Glacier mass balance==
[[File:Glacier Mass Balance Map.png|thumb|280px|This map of mountain glacier mass balance changes since 1970 shows thinning in yellow and red, and thickening in blue.]]
[[File:Glacier Mass Balance.png|thumb|280px|Global glacial mass balance in the last fifty years, reported to the [[World Glacier Monitoring Service|WGMS]] and [[National Snow and Ice Data Center|NSIDC]].  The increasing downward trend in the late 1980s is symptomatic of the increased rate and number of retreating glaciers.]]
{{Main article|Glacier mass balance}}
The mass balance, or difference between [[glacier ice accumulation|accumulation]] and [[Ablation zone|ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]]), of a glacier is crucial to its survival.&lt;ref name=mote-kaser&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Philip W.|last1=Mote|first2=Georg|last2=Kaser|journal=American Scientist|volume=95|issue=4|year=2007|title=The Shrinking Glaciers of Kilimanjaro: Can Global Warming Be Blamed?|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2007/4/the-shrinking-glaciers-of-kilimanjaro-can-global-warming-be-blamed/1|pages=318–325|doi=10.1511/2007.66.318}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alex S. Gardner|author2=Geir Moholdt|author3=J.

Glacier retreat results in the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of a significant portion of the accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.&lt;ref name=hubbard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Bryn|author2=Neil F. Glasser|title=Field Techniques in Glaciology and Glacial Geomorphology|date=May 20, 2005|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470844274|pages=179–198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9MWQT0gdBMC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pelto2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pelto, M.S.|title=Forecasting temperate alpine glacier survival from accumulation zone observations|journal=The Cryosphere|year=2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=67–75|url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/4/67/2010/tc-4-67-2010.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.5194/tc-4-67-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for measuring retreat include staking [[Glacier terminus|terminus location]], [[global positioning]] mapping, [[aerial mapping]] and laser [[altimetry]].&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Peter U.|title=Abrupt Climate Change: Final Report, Synthesis and Assessment Product|date=September 28, 2009|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437915693|pages=39–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92T2d-0NBkQC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning along the entire length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive.&lt;ref name=pelto2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mauri S.|last=Pelto|authorlink=Mauri S. Pelto|title=The Disequilibrium of North Cascade, Washington Glaciers 1984–2004|work=In Hydrologic Processes|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/diseqilibrium.html|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Easton Glacier]] in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the [[Grinnell Glacier]] in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.&lt;ref name=pelto2/&gt;

==Middle latitude glaciers==
[[Middle latitudes|Middle latitude]] glaciers are located either between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Arctic Circle]], or between the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schultz|first1=Jürgen|title=The Ecozones of the World: The Ecological Divisions of the Geosphere|date=September 7, 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3540200147|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twKm1qzrnyUC&amp;pg=PA103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, which are usually located in higher mountainous regions.&lt;ref name=clark/&gt; All are located in mountain ranges, notably the [[Himalayas]]; the [[Alps]]; the [[Pyrenees]]; [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Pacific Coast Range]]s of North America; the [[Patagonia]]n Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=hensen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hensen|first1=Robert|title=The Rough Guide to Climate Change|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=DK|isbn=9781843537113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL4dZLYZjRwC&amp;pg=PT152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes are in a state of negative mass balance and are retreating.&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

Other researchers have found that glaciers across the Alps appear to be retreating at a faster rate than a few decades ago. In a paper published in 2009 by the University of Zurich, the Swiss glacier survey of 89 glaciers found 76 retreating, 5 stationary and 8 advancing from where they had been in 1973.&lt;ref name=zurich&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swiss Glaciers Glaciological Report (Glacier) No. 125/126|url=http://glaciology.ethz.ch/swiss-glaciers/downloadPubs/glrep_125-126.pdf|publisher=University of Zurich|accessdate=April 11, 2015|pages=14–17|format=pdf|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trift Glacier]] had the greatest recorded retreat, losing {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} of its length between the years 2003 and 2005.&lt;ref name=zurich/&gt;  The Grosser [[Aletsch Glacier]] is the largest glacier in Switzerland and has been studied since the late 19th century.

The overall retreat from 1878 to 1998 has been {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a mean annual retreat rate of approximately {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year. This long-term average was markedly surpassed in recent years with the glacier receding {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year during the period between 1999–2005. Similarly, of the glaciers in the Italian Alps, only about a third were in retreat in 1980, while by 1999, 89% of these glaciers were retreating.

Though the glaciers of the Alps have received more attention from glaciologists than in other areas of Europe, research indicates that glaciers in northern Europe are also retreating.

As initial cause for glacier retreat in the alps since 1850, a decrease of the glaciers [[albedo]], caused by industrial [[black carbon]] can be identified.

====Siberia and the Russian Far East====
[[Siberia]] is typically classified as a polar region, owing to the dryness of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high [[Altai Mountains]], [[Verkhoyansk Range]], [[Cherskiy Range]] and [[Suntar-Khayata Range]], plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near [[Lake Baikal]], which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989.&lt;ref name=surazakov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Surazakov|first1=A.B.|last2=Aizem|first2=V.B.|last3=Aizem|first3=E.M.|last4=Nikitin|first4=S.A.|title=Glacier Changes in the Siberian Altai Mountains, Ob river basin, (1952–2006) estimated with high resolution imagery|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/045017|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/2/4/045017/fulltext/|accessdate=July 6, 2015|format=PDF|pages=045017|bibcode = 2007ERL.....2d5017S |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dyurgerov&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dyurgerov|first1=Mark B.|last2=Meier|first2=Mark F.|title=Glaciers and the Changing Earth System: A 2004 Snapshot|url=http://instaar.colorado.edu/other/download/OP58_dyurgerov_meier.pdf|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=July 6, 2015|format=PDF|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ananicheva&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ananicheva|first1=M.D.|last2=Krenke|first2=A.N.|last3=Barry|first3=R.G.|title=The Northeast Asia mountain glaciers  in the near future by AOGCM scenarios|journal=The Cryosphere|date=October 6, 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=435–445|doi=10.5194/tc-4-435-2010|url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/4/435/2010/tc-4-435-2010.pdf|accessdate=July 21, 2015|format=PDF|bibcode = 2010TCry....4..435A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=surazakov/&gt; This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers.

In the more maritime and generally wetter [[Russian Far East]], [[Kamchatka]], exposed during winter to moisture from the [[Aleutian Low]], has much more extensive glaciation totaling around {{convert|906|km2|abbr=on}} with 448 known glaciers as of 2010.&lt;ref name=ananicheva/&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Vivienne|last2=Solomina|first2=Olga|title=The geography of Kamchatka|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=June 6, 2015|issue=132|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.06.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818115001137|accessdate=July 21, 2015|volume=134|pages=3–9|bibcode = 2015GPC...134....3J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite generally heavy winter snowfall and cool summer temperatures, the high summer rainfall of the more southerly [[Kuril Islands]] and [[Sakhalin]] in historic times melt rates have been too high for a positive mass balance even on the highest peaks.

Details on the retreat of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less adequate than in most other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that since the collapse of [[Communism]] there has been a large reduction in the number of monitoring stations.&lt;ref name=unep&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Glacier Changes: facts and figures Northern Asia|url=http://www.grid.unep.ch/glaciers/pdfs/6_7.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=July 17, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=ananicheva/&gt; Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. [[Sakha Republic|Sakha’s]] glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28&amp;nbsp;percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====Himalayas and Central Asia====
[[File:Glacial lakes, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|390px|This [[NASA]] image shows the formation of numerous glacial lakes at the termini of receding glaciers in [[Bhutan]]-[[Himalaya]].]]
The Himalayas and other mountain chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions.

As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9&amp;nbsp;percent reduction in ice mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laghari|first1=Javaid|title=Climate change: Melting glaciers bring energy uncertainty|journal=Nature|volume=502|issue=7473|pages=617–618|url=http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-melting-glaciers-bring-energy-uncertainty-1.14031#/b5|accessdate=November 15, 2015|date=November 11, 2013|doi=10.1038/502617a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

North American glaciers are primarily located along the spine of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada, and the Pacific Coast Ranges extending from northern [[California]] to [[Alaska]]. While [[Greenland]] is geologically associated with North America, it is also a part of the Arctic region. Apart from the few tidewater glaciers such as [[Taku Glacier]], in the advance stage of their [[tidewater glacier cycle]] prevalent along the coast of Alaska, virtually all of those in North America are in a state of retreat. This  rate has increased rapidly since around 1980, and overall each decade since has seen greater rates of retreat than the preceding one. There are also small remnant glaciers scattered throughout the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of California and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huegel|first=Tony|title=Sierra Nevada Byways: 51 of the Sierra Nevada's Best Backcountry Drives (Backcountry Byways)|year=2008|publisher=Wilderness Press|isbn=978-0-89997-473-6|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lqF-mz0HMkYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=remnant+glaciers+in+california#v=onepage&amp;q=remnant%20glaciers%20in%20california&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castor|first=Stephen B.|title=Proceedings of the 39th Forum on the Geology of Industrial Minerals, Nevada|year=2004|publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology|pages=192|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zxZpWTnRXpEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=glaciers+in+the+state+of+nevada#v=onepage&amp;q=glaciers%20in%20the%20state%20of%20nevada&amp;f=false|author2=Keith G, Papke, Richard O.

====Cascade Range====
The [[Cascade Range]] of western North America extends from southern [[British Columbia]] in Canada to northern California. Excepting Alaska, about half of the glacial area in the U.S. is contained within the over 700 glaciers of the [[North Cascades National Park|North Cascades]], a portion of those located between the Canada–US border and [[I-90]] in central [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. These contain much water as is found in all the lakes and reservoirs in the rest of the state, and provide much of the stream and river flow in the dry summer months, approximating some {{convert|870000|m3|yd3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelto|first=Mauri S.|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastonterm.jpg|thumb|250px|The Easton Glacier retreated {{convert|255|m|ft|abbr=on}} from 1990 to 2005.]]
As recently as 1975 many North Cascade glaciers were advancing due to cooler weather and increased precipitation that occurred from 1944 to 1976. By 1987 the North Cascade glaciers were retreating and the pace had increased each decade since the mid-1970s. Between 1984 and 2005 the North Cascade glaciers lost an average of more than {{convert|12.5|m}} in thickness and 20–40&amp;nbsp;percent of their volume.&lt;ref name=pelto2/&gt;

Glaciologists researching the North Cascades found that all 47 monitored glaciers are receding while four glaciers—[[Spider Glacier (Phelps Ridge, Washington)|Spider Glacier]], [[Lewis Glacier (Oregon)|Lewis Glacier]], [[Milk Lake Glacier]] and [[David Glacier]]—have disappeared completely since 1985. The [[White Chuck Glacier]] (near [[Glacier Peak]]) is a particularly dramatic example. The glacier area shrank from {{convert|3.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1958 to {{convert|0.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 2002. Between 1850 and 1950, the [[Boulder Glacier (Washington)|Boulder Glacier]] on the southeast flank of [[Mount Baker]] retreated {{convert|8700|ft}}. William Long of the United States Forest Service observed the glacier beginning to advance due to cooler/wetter weather in 1953. This was followed by a {{convert|743|m}} advance by 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mauri S. Pelto |author2=Cliff Hedlund | title= Terminus behavior and response time of North Cascade glaciers, Washington, U.S.A | journal= Journal of Glaciology| year= 2001| volume= 47| issue= 158| pages= 497–506| url= http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/terminus_behavior_and_response_t.htm| doi= 10.3189/172756501781832098|bibcode = 2001JGlac..47..497P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The glacier again retreated {{convert|450|m|ft|abbr=on}} from 1987 to 2005, leaving barren terrain behind. This retreat has occurred during a period of reduced winter snowfall and higher summer temperatures. In this region of the Cascades, winter [[snowpack]] has declined 25% since 1946, and summer temperatures have risen 0.7&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) during the same period. The reduced snowpack has occurred despite a small increase in winter precipitation—thus, it reflects warmer winter temperatures leading to rainfall and melting on glaciers even during the winter. As of 2005, 67% of the North Cascade glaciers observed are in disequilibrium and will not survive the continuation of the present climate. These glaciers will eventually disappear unless temperatures fall and frozen precipitation increases. The remaining glaciers are expected to stabilize, unless the climate continues to warm, but will be much reduced in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mauri S.

====U.S. Rocky Mountains====
On the sheltered slopes of the highest peaks of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in [[Montana]], the [[eponymous]] glaciers are diminishing rapidly. The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the [[National Park Service]] and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comparing photographs from the mid-19th century with contemporary images provides ample evidence that they have retreated notably since 1850. Repeat photography since clearly show that glaciers such as [[Grinnell Glacier]] are all retreating. The larger glaciers are now approximately a third of their former size when first studied in 1850, and numerous smaller glaciers have disappeared completely. Only 27% of the {{convert|99|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Glacier Monitoring in Glacier National Park |url=http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218164617/http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe that by the year 2030, the vast majority of glacial ice in Glacier National Park will be gone unless current climate patterns reverse their course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior | title=Glacier Retreat in Glacier National Park, Montana| url=http://nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glacier_retreat.htm| accessdate=April 25, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grinnell Glacier is just one of many glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been well documented by photographs for many decades.

The semiarid climate of [[Wyoming]] still manages to support about a dozen small glaciers within [[Grand Teton National Park]], which all show evidence of retreat over the past 50 years. [[Schoolroom Glacier]] is located slightly southwest of [[Grand Teton]] is one of the more easily reached glaciers in the park and it is expected to disappear by 2025.  Research between 1950 and 1999 demonstrated that the glaciers in [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]] and [[Shoshone National Forest]] in the [[Wind River Range]] shrank by over a third of their size during that period. Photographs indicate that the glaciers today are only half the size as when first photographed in the late 1890s. Research also indicates that the glacial retreat was proportionately greater in the 1990s than in any other decade over the last 100 years. [[Gannett Glacier]] on the northeast slope of [[Gannett Peak]] is the largest single glacier in the [[Rocky Mountains]] south of Canada. It has reportedly lost over 50% of its volume since 1920, with almost half of that loss occurring since 1980. Glaciologists believe the remaining glaciers in Wyoming will disappear by the middle of the 21st century if the current climate patterns continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wyoming Water Resources Data System Library | title=Glacial Icemelt in the Wind River Range, Wyoming | url=http://library.wrds.uwyo.edu/wrp/90-16/90-16.html | date=July 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Canadian Rockies]], glaciers are generally larger and more widespread than to the south in the Rocky Mountains. One of the more accessible in the Canadian Rockies is the [[Mount Athabasca|Athabasca Glacier]], which is an outlet glacier of the {{convert|325|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} [[Columbia Icefield]]. The Athabasca Glacier has retreated {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} since the late 19th century. Its rate of retreat has increased since 1980, following a period of slow retreat from 1950 to 1980. The [[Peyto Glacier]] in [[Alberta]] covers an area of about {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and retreated rapidly during the first half of the 20th century, stabilized by 1966, and resumed shrinking in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Canadian Cryospheric Information Network | title=Past Variability of Canadian Glaciers | url=http://www.socc.ca/cms/en/socc/glaciers/pastGlaciers.aspx | accessdate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Illecillewaet Glacier]] in British Columbia's [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], part of the [[Selkirk Mountains]] (west of the Rockies) has retreated {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} since first photographed in 1887.

In [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]] in Southwestern [[British Columbia]] over {{convert|505|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 26%, of the park, was covered by glacier ice at the beginning of the 18th century. Ice cover decreased to {{convert|297|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 1987–1988 and to {{convert|245|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 2005, 50% of the 1850 area. The {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} loss in the last 20 years coincides with negative mass balance in the region. During this period all nine glaciers examined have retreated significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Koch, B. Menounos  |author2=J.

There are thousands of glaciers in Alaska but only few have been named. The [[Columbia Glacier (Alaska)|Columbia Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] in [[Prince William Sound]] has retreated {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the last 25 years. Its calved icebergs partially caused the [[Exxon Valdez]] oil spill, when the tanker changed course to avoid the ice tips. The Valdez Glacier is in the same area, and though it does not calve, has also retreated significantly. "A 2005 aerial survey of Alaskan coastal glaciers identified more than a dozen glaciers, many former tidewater and [[Ice calving|calving]] glaciers, including Grand Plateau, Alsek, Bear, and Excelsior Glaciers that are rapidly retreating. Of 2,000 glaciers observed, 99% are retreating."&lt;ref name=pelto5/&gt; Icy Bay in Alaska is fed by three large glaciers—Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers—all of which have experienced a loss in length and thickness and, consequently, a loss in area. Tyndall Glacier became separated from the retreating Guyot Glacier in the 1960s and has retreated {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} since, averaging more than {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bruce F.

A large region of population surrounding the central and southern Andes of [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] reside in arid areas that are dependent on water supplies from melting glaciers. The water from the glaciers also supplies rivers that have in some cases been dammed for [[hydroelectric]] power. Some researchers believe that by 2030, many of the large ice caps on the highest Andes will be gone if current climate trends continue. In Patagonia on the southern tip of the continent, the large ice caps have retreated a {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} since the early 1990s and {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} since the late 19th century. It has also been observed that Patagonian glaciers are receding at a faster rate than in any other world region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patagonian ice in rapid retreat |date=April 27, 2000 |publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3662975.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field]] lost {{convert|93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of glacier area during the years between 1945 and 1975, and {{convert|174|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} from 1975 to 1996, which indicates that the rate of retreat is increasing. This represents a loss of 8% of the ice field, with all glaciers experiencing significant retreat. The [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] has exhibited a general trend of retreat on 42 glaciers, while four glaciers were in equilibrium and two advanced during the years between 1944 and 1986.  The largest retreat was on [[O'Higgins Glacier]], which during the period 1896–1995 retreated {{convert|14.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Notice the larger terminal lakes, the retreat of the white ice (ice free of moraine cover), and the higher moraine walls due to ice thinning. [[:File:DSCN5238-muller-moraine b.jpg|Photo.]] ]]
In New Zealand, mountain glaciers have been in general retreat since 1890, with an acceleration since 1920. Most have measurably thinned and reduced in size, and the snow accumulation zones have risen in elevation as the 20th century progressed. Between 1971–75 Ivory Glacier receded {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the glacial terminus, and about 26% of its surface area was lost. Since 1980 numerous small glacial lakes formed behind the new terminal moraines of several of these glaciers. Glaciers such as Classen, Godley and Douglas now all have new glacial lakes below their terminal locations due to the glacial retreat over the past 20 years. Satellite imagery indicates that these lakes are continuing to expand.

Several glaciers, notably the much-visited [[Fox Glacier|Fox]] and [[Franz Josef Glacier]]s on New Zealand's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], have periodically advanced, especially during the 1990s, but the scale of these advances is small when compared to 20th-century retreat. Both are more than {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter than a century ago. These large, rapidly flowing glaciers situated on steep slopes have been very reactive to small mass-balance changes. A few years of conditions favorable to glacier advance, such as more westerly winds and a resulting increase in snowfall, are rapidly echoed in a corresponding advance, followed by equally rapid retreat when those favorable conditions end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glaciers of New Zealand | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand2.html | date=May 4, 2000 |author1 = United States Department of the Interior | authorlink1=United States Department of the Interior }}&lt;/ref&gt; The glaciers that have been advancing in a few locations in New Zealand have been doing so due to transient local weather conditions, which have brought more precipitation and cloudier, cooler summers since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Goodenough|title=A Glacier Grows, Undeterred by Heated Kyoto Debate|date=July 7, 2008|publisher=Cybercast News Service|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/glacier-grows-undeterred-heated-kyoto-debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Tropical glaciers==
[[Tropical]] glaciers are located between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], in the region that lies [[latitude|23° 26′ 22″]] north or south of the [[equator]]. Strictly, a tropical glacier is located within the astronomical [[tropics]]; the area where the annual temperature variation is less than the daily variation, and is within the oscillation area of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaser and Osmaton|title=Tropical Glaciers|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-63333-8|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical glaciers are the most uncommon of all glaciers for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the  regions are the warmest part of the planet. Secondly, the seasonal change is minimal with temperatures warm year round, resulting in a lack of a colder winter season in which snow and ice can accumulate. Thirdly, few taller mountains exist in these regions upon which enough cold air exists for the establishment of glaciers. Overall, tropical glaciers are smaller than those found elsewhere and are the most likely glaciers to show rapid response to changing climate patterns. A small temperature increase of only a few degrees can have almost immediate and adverse effect on tropical glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Raymond| last=Pierrehumbert |authorlink=Raymond Pierrehumbert |title=Tropical Glacier Retreat |work=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=157  |date=May 23, 2005| accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the Equator, ice is still found in East Africa, the Andes of South America and New Guinea.  The retreat of equatorial glaciers has been documented via maps and photographs covering the period from the late 1800s to nearly the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastenrath|first=Stefan|title=Recession of equatorial glaciers : a photo documentation|year=2008|publisher=Sundog Publishing|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=978-0-9729033-3-2|pages=142|url=http://www.sundogpublishing.com/shop/recession-of-equatorial-glaciers-a-photo-documenation-s-hastenrath/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515081904/http://www.sundogpublishing.com/shop/recession-of-equatorial-glaciers-a-photo-documenation-s-hastenrath/|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 99.64% of tropical glaciers are in Andean mountains of South America, 0.25% on the African glaciers of Rwenzori, Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro, and 0.11% in the Irian Jaya region in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmaton and Kaser|title=Tropical Glaciers|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-63333-8|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
[[File:Glacier at summit of Mt Kilimanjaro 001.JPG|left|250px|thumb|[[Furtwängler Glacier]] atop [[Kilimanjaro]] in the foreground and snowfields and the Northern Icefields beyond.]]
Almost all Africa is in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] climate zones. Its glaciers are found only in two isolated ranges and the [[Ruwenzori Range]]. Kilimanjaro, at {{convert|5895|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest peak on the continent. Since 1912 the glacier cover on the summit of Kilimanjaro has apparently retreated 75%, and the volume of glacial ice is now 80% less than it was a century ago due to both retreat and thinning.&lt;ref name=kilimanjaro4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.ohio-state.edu/news_detail.php?newsId=1 |title=Snows of Kilimanjaro Disappearing, Glacial Ice Loss Increasing |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=August 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901111936/http://www.geology.ohio-state.edu/news_detail.php?newsId=1 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 14-year period from 1984 to 1998, one section of the glacier atop the mountain receded {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrew Wielochowski | title=Glacial recession on Kilimanjaro| url=http://www.kilimanjaro.cc/glacial-recession.htm | date=October 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 study determined that if current conditions continue, the glaciers atop Kilimanjaro will disappear sometime between 2015 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Lonnie G.

The [[Furtwängler Glacier]] is located near the summit of Kilimanjaro.

This hole, extending through the {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} remaining thickness of the glacier to the underlying rock, was expected to grow and split the glacier in two by 2007.&lt;ref name=kilimanjaro4/&gt;

To the north of Kilimanjaro lies [[Mount Kenya]], which at {{convert|5199|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the second tallest mountain on the  continent. Mount Kenya has a number of small glaciers that have lost at least 45% of their mass since the middle of the 20th century. According to research compiled by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), there were eighteen glaciers atop Mount Kenya in 1900, and by 1986 only eleven remained. The total area covered by glaciers was {{convert|1.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1900, however by the year 2000 only about 25%, or {{convert|0.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=U.S. Geological Survey | title=Glaciers of Africa | work=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1386-G-3 | format=PDF | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386g/africa.pdf#search='USGS%20Mount%20Kilimanjaro%20glacier'}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenya, the Ruwenzori Range rises to {{convert|5109|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Photographic evidence indicates a marked reduction in glacially covered areas over the past century. In the 35-year period between 1955 and 1990, glaciers on the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] receded about 40%. It is expected that due to their proximity to the heavy moisture of the [[Congo River|Congo]] region, the glaciers in the Ruwenzori Range may recede at a slower rate than those on Kilimanjaro or in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrew Wielochowski  | title=Glacial recession in the Rwenzori | url=http://www.kilimanjaro.cc/rwenzoriglaciers.htm | accessdate=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
A study by glaciologists of two small glaciers in South America reveals another retreat. More than 80% of all glacial ice in the northern Andes is concentrated on the highest peaks in small plains of approximately {{convert|1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size. A 1992 to 1998 observation of the [[Chacaltaya]] Glacier in [[Bolivia]] and Antizana Glacier in [[Ecuador]] indicate that between {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} of ice was lost per year on each glacier. Figures for Chacaltaya show a loss of 67% of its volume and 40% of its thickness over the same period. Chacaltaya Glacier has lost 90% of its mass since 1940 and was expected to disappear altogether sometime between 2010 and 2015. Antizana is also reported to have lost 40% of its surface area between 1979 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tegel|first=Simeon|title=Antisana's Glaciers: Victims of Climate Change|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/equador-antisana-melting-glaciers-climate-change|publisher=GlobalPost|accessdate=13 August 2012|date=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research also indicates that since the mid-1980s, the rate of retreat for both of these glaciers has been increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bernard Francou| title=Small Glaciers Of The Andes May Vanish In 10–15 Years| work=UniSci, International Science News| url=http://unisci.com/stories/20011/0117013.htm | accessdate=January 22, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Colombia]], the glaciers atop [[Nevado del Ruiz]] have lost more than half their area in the last 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huggel|first=Cristian|author2=Ceballos, Jorge Luis |author3=Pulgarín, Bernardo |author4=Ramírez, Jair |author5= Thouret, Jean-Claude |title=Review and reassessment of hazards owing to volcano–glacier interactions in Colombia|year=2007|volume=45|issue=1|journal=Annals of Glaciology|pages=128–136|url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/45/a45A019.pdf|doi=10.3189/172756407782282408|format=PDF|bibcode = 2007AnGla..45..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south in [[Peru]], the Andes are at a higher altitude overall, and there are approximately 722 glaciers covering an area of {{convert|723|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

[[Jan Carstensz]]'s 1623 report of glaciers covering the [[List of highest mountains of New Guinea|equatorial mountains]] of [[New Guinea]] was originally met with ridicule, but in the early 20th century at least five subranges of the [[Maoke Mountains]] (meaning "Snowy Mountains") were indeed still found to be covered with large ice caps.  Due to the location of the island within the tropical zone, there is little to no seasonal variation in temperature. The tropical location has a predictably steady level of rain and snowfall, as well as cloud cover year round, and there has been no noticeable change in the amount of moisture which has fallen during the 20th century.

In 1913, {{convert|4550|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Prins Hendrik peaks (now [[Puncak Yamin]]) was named and reported to have "eternal" snow, but this observation was never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;E.J.

This leaves only the remnants of the once continuous icecap on New Guinea's highest mountain, [[Mount Carstensz]] with the {{convert|4884|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Puncak Jaya]] summit, which is estimated to have had an area of {{convert|20|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1850.

For this mountain there is photographic evidence of massive glacial retreat since the region was first extensively explored by airplane in 1936 in preparation for the [[Carstensz Expedition|peak's first ascent]]. Between then and 2010, the mountain lost 80 percent of its ice — two-thirds of which since another scientific expedition in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDowell |first=Robin |title=Indonesia’s Last Glacier Will Melt ‘Within Years’ |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/indonesias-last-glacier-will-melt-within-years/383607 |accessdate=2011-10-23 |newspaper=Jakarta Globe |date=July 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816134134/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/indonesias-last-glacier-will-melt-within-years/383607 |archivedate=August 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That research between 1973 and 1976 showed glacier retreat for the Meren Glacier of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} while the [[Carstensz Glacier]] lost {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

==Polar regions==
Despite their proximity and importance to human populations, the mountain and valley glaciers of tropical and mid-latitude glaciers amount to only a small fraction of glacial ice on the Earth. About 99&amp;nbsp;percent of all freshwater ice is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} or more in thickness, cap much of the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusky|first=Timothy|title=Encyclopedia of Earth and Space Science|year=2010|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0-8160-7005-3|pages=343|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vMk4t21fOvoC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=most+of+the+world's+ice+is+locked+up+in+antarctica+and+greenland#|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The northern Atlantic island nation of [[Iceland]] is home to [[Vatnajökull]], which is the largest ice cap in Europe. The [[Breiðamerkurjökull]] glacier is one of Vatnajökull's outlet glaciers, and receded by as much as {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} between 1973 and 2004. In the early 20th century, Breiðamerkurjökull extended to within {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the ocean, but by 2004 its terminus had retreated {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} further inland. This glacier retreat exposed a rapidly expanding lagoon, [[Jökulsárlón]], which is filled with icebergs calved from its front. Jökulsárlón is {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and nearly doubled its size between 1994 and 2004. Mass-balance measurements of Iceland's glaciers show alternating positive and negative mass balance of glaciers during the period 1987–95, but the mass balance has been predominantly negative since. On Hofsjökull ice cap, mass balance has been negative each year from 1995–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sveinsson|first=Óli Gretar Blondal|title=XXV Nordic Hydrological Conference|url=http://www.vedur.is/media/vatnafar/saga/NHC2008_volume2_web.pdf|publisher=Nordic Association for Hydrology|accessdate=2011-10-15|format=pdf|date=August 11–13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly during the warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing down as the climate cooled during the following decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate that has taken place since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored each year by the Icelandic Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Sigurdsson, Oddur, Trausti Jonsson and Tomas Johannesson| title=Relation between glacier-termini variations and summer temperature in Iceland since 1930| format=PDF| website= | publisher=Hydrological Service, National Energy Authority| url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/46/a46A210.pdf| accessdate=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenland===
[[File:Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland.jpg|thumb|300px|Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland]]
In [[Greenland]], glacier retreat has been observed in outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate and destabilization of the mass balance of the ice sheet that is their source. The net loss in volume and hence sea level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has doubled in recent years from {{convert|90|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} per year in 1996 to {{convert|220|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} per year in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rignot, E.  |author2=Kanagaratnam, P.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Changes in the Velocity Structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet| journal=Science| date=February 17, 2006| volume=311| issue=5763| pages=986–990| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5763/986| doi=10.1126/science.1121381| pmid=16484490|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..986R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also noted that the acceleration was widespread affecting almost all glaciers south of 70 N by 2005. The period since 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched—[[Helheim Glacier]], [[Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier]], and [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]]—jointly drain more than 16% of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]]. In the case of Helheim Glacier, researchers used satellite images to determine the movement and retreat of the glacier. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. In 2001 the glacier began retreating rapidly, and by 2005 the glacier had retreated a total of {{convert|7.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, accelerating from {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day to {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ian Howat | title=Rapidly accelerating glaciers may increase how fast the sea level rises | work=UC Santa Cruz,  November 14–27, 2005 Vol. 10, No. 14 | url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp |accessdate=November 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakobshavn Isbræ in west Greenland, a major outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet, has been the fastest moving glacier in the world over the past half century. It had been moving continuously at speeds of over {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day with a stable terminus since at least 1950. In 2002 the {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long floating terminus of the glacier entered a phase of rapid retreat, with the ice front breaking up and the floating terminus disintegrating and  accelerating to a retreat rate of over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day. On a shorter timescale, portions of the main trunk of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier that were flowing at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day from 1988 to 2001 were measured to be flowing at {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day in the summer of 2005. Not only has Kangerdlugssuaq retreated, it has also thinned by more than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=M Truffer, University of Alaska Fairbanks; M Fahnestock, University of New Hampshire | title=The Dynamics of Glacier System Response: Tidewater Glaciers and the Ice Streams and Outlet Glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica I |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html | archivedate=April 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422071200/http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid thinning, acceleration and retreat of Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland, all in close association with one another, suggests a common triggering mechanism, such as enhanced surface melting due to regional climate warming or a change in forces at the glacier front. The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase and the release of meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=S.

Thus, suggests ocean temperature controls ice sheet surface runoff at specific sites. These findings also show that models underestimate the sensitivity of Greenland glaciers to ocean warming and resulting ice sheet runoff. Hence, without better modelling, new observations suggest that past projections of sea level rise attribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet require upward revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=42 |issue=14 |pages=5909–5917 |author1=Eric Rignot |author2=Ian Fenty |author3=Yun Xu |author4=Cilan Cai |author5=Chris Kemp |year=2015|title=Undercutting of marine-terminating glaciers in West Greenland|doi=10.1002/2015GL064236|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/28j711jc|bibcode=2015GeoRL..42.5909R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antarctica===
{{See also|List of glaciers in the Antarctic|List of Antarctic ice shelves}}
[[File:Larsen B Collapse.jpg|thumb|250px|The collapsing Larsen B Ice Shelf in [[Antarctica]] is similar in area to the U.S. state of [[Rhode Island]].]]
[[climate of Antarctica|Antarctica]] is intensely cold and arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat is the loss of large sections of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.

The Antarctic sheet is the largest known single mass of ice. It covers almost 14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and some 30 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the planet's surface is held in this area and if melted would raise sea levels by 58 metres.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/412.htm#tab113 ''Physical characteristics of ice on Earth'', Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis.

The Antarctic sheet is divided by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] into two unequal sections known as the [[East Antarctic ice sheet]] (EAIS) and the smaller [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but the bed of the WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below [[sea level]]. It would be [[seabed]] if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Ronne Ice Shelf]], and outlet glaciers that drain into the [[Amundsen Sea]].

Ice shelves are not stable when surface melting occurs, and the collapse of Larsen Ice Shelf has been caused by warmer melt season temperatures that have led to surface melting and the formation of shallow ponds of water on the ice shelf. The Larsen Ice Shelf lost {{convert|2500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of its area from 1995 to 2001. In a 35-day period beginning on January 31, 2002, about {{convert|3250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of shelf area disintegrated. The ice shelf is now 40% the size of its previous minimum stable extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=National Snow and Ice Data Center | title=Larsen B Ice Shelf Collapses in Antarctica| work=The Cryosphere, Where the World is Frozen| url=http://nsidc.org/news/press/larsen_B/2002.html| date=March 21, 2002| accessdate=November 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a study concluded that the remaining ''Larsen B'' ice-shelf will disintegrate by the end of the decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Study Shows Antarctica's Larsen B Ice Shelf Nearing Its Final Act|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-study-shows-antarctica-s-larsen-b-ice-shelf-nearing-its-final-act|author=NASA|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones Ice Shelf had an area of {{convert|35|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} in the 1970s but by 2008 it had disappeared.&lt;ref name=apis&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A.

==Effects of glacier retreat==
{{See also|Deglaciation}}
The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melting glaciers threaten Peru|date=October 9, 2003|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3172572.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Asian]] countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the [[Pacific Northwest]] of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.

Some of this retreat has resulted in efforts to slow down the loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the [[Stubai Alps|Stubai]] and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=M.

Many species of freshwater and saltwater plants and animals are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure the cold water habitat to which they have adapted. Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with [[salmon]] and [[cutthroat trout]]. Reduced glacial runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive.  Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the [[World Ocean]], may affect existing [[fisheries]] upon which humans depend as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economics of Adapting Fisheries to Climate Change|year=2011|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-09036-1|pages=47–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FboCKhLSfysC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=increased+glacier+melt+impact+fisheries#v=onepage&amp;q=increased%20glacier%20melt%20impact%20fisheries&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major concern is the increased risk of [[Glacial Lake Outburst Flood]]s (GLOF), which have in the past had great effect on lives and property.&lt;ref name=unep2&gt;{{cite press release|date=16 April 2002|title=Global Warming Triggers Glacial Lakes Flood Threat|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=14 November 2015|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=245&amp;ArticleID=3042|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050526075346/http%3A//www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID%3D245%26ArticleID%3D3042|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glacier meltwater left behind by the retreating glacier is often held back by [[moraine]]s that can be unstable and have been known to collapse if breached or displaced by earthquakes, landslides or avalanches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=An Overview of Glaciers, Glacier Retreat, and Subsequent Impacts in Nepal, India and China|publisher=WWF Nepal Program|date=March 2005|page=3|url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/himalayaglaciersreport2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the terminal moraine is not strong enough to hold the rising water behind it, it can burst, leading to a massive localized flood. The likelihood of such events is rising due to the creation and expansion of glacial lakes resulting from glacier retreat.&lt;ref name=unep2/&gt; Past floods have been deadly and have resulted in enormous property damage. Towns and villages in steep, narrow valleys that are downstream from glacial lakes are at the greatest risk. In 1892 a GLOF released some {{convert|200000|m3|yd3|abbr=on}} of water from the lake of the [[Glacier de Tête Rousse]], resulting in the deaths of 200 people in the French town of [[Saint-Gervais-les-Bains]].&lt;ref name=pelto5&gt;{{cite web|author=Mauri S. Pelto|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLOFs have been known to occur in every region of the world where glaciers are located. Continued glacier retreat is expected to create and expand glacial lakes, increasing the danger of future GLOFs.

The potential for major [[sea level rise]] depends mostly on a significant melting of the polar ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as this is where the vast majority of glacial ice is located. If all the ice on the polar ice caps were to melt away, the oceans of the world would rise an estimated {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although previously it was thought that the polar ice caps were not contributing heavily to sea level rise (IPCC 2007), recent studies have confirmed that both Antarctica and Greenland are contributing {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} a year each to global sea level rise.&lt;ref name="pmid17272686"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rahmstorf S, Cazenave A, Church JA |title=Recent climate observations compared to projections |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5825 |page=709 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17272686 |doi=10.1126/science.1136843 |url= |bibcode=2007Sci...316..709R|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |last3=Church |last4=Hansen |last5=Keeling |last6=Parker |last7=Somerville }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Velicogna | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1029/2009GL040222 | title = Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = 19 | pages = L19503 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GeoRL..3619503V | citeseerx = 10.1.1.170.8753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cazenave | first1 = A. | last2 = Dominh | first2 = K. | last3 = Guinehut | first3 = S. | last4 = Berthier | first4 = E. | last5 = Llovel | first5 = W. | last6 = Ramillien | first6 = G. | last7 = Ablain | first7 = M. | last8 = Larnicol | first8 = G. | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.10.004 | title = Sea level budget over 2003–2008: A reevaluation from GRACE space gravimetry, satellite altimetry and Argo | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–88 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GPC....65...83C | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00401223/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the IPCC estimates did not include rapid ice sheet decay into their sea level predictions makes it difficult to ascertain a plausible estimate for sea level rise but recent studies find that the minimum sea level rise will be around {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} by 2100.&lt;ref name="pmid18772435"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pfeffer WT, Harper JT, O'Neel S |title=Kinematic constraints on glacier contributions to 21st-century sea-level rise |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=321 |issue=5894 |pages=1340–3 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18772435 |doi=10.1126/science.1159099 |url= |bibcode = 2008Sci...321.1340P |last2=Harper |last3=O'Neel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|400px|Sectioned [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] round with the inner shaped charge visible]]

[[File:CumulativeHead.png|thumb|300px|1: Aerodynamic cover; 2: Air-filled cavity; 3: Conical liner; 4: Detonator; 5: Explosive; 6: [[Piezoelectric sensor|Piezo-electric]] trigger]]

A '''shaped charge''' is an [[explosive]] charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to cut and form metal, initiate [[nuclear weapon]]s, penetrate [[armor]], and [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|"complete" wells]] in the [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas industry]].

A typical modern shaped charge, with a metal liner on the charge cavity, can penetrate armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10&amp;nbsp;CD and above&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf|title=Shaped Charges Pierce the Toughest Targets|last=Post|first=Richard|date=June 1, 1998|website=|publisher=Science &amp; Technology Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been achieved. Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym [[HEAT]]) the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2007/ARL-SR-150.pdf Introduction to Shaped Charges, Walters, Army Research Laboratory, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munroe effect==
The Munroe or Neumann effect is the focusing of blast energy by a hollow or void cut on a surface of an explosive. The earliest mention of hollow charges occurred in 1792. [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] (1765–1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical space at the forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive's effect and thereby save powder.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Baader (March 1792) [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10704955_00275.html "Versuch einer Theorie der Sprengarbeit"] (Investigation of a theory of blasting), ''Bergmännisches Journal'' (Miners' Journal), vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 193–212.  Reprinted in:  Franz Hoffmann et al. ed.s, ''Franz von Baader's sämtliche Werke …'' [Franz von Baader's complete works …] (Leipzig (Germany):  Herrmann Bethmann, 1854), Part I, vol. 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vS4CAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 153–166.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the [[Harz]] mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive at the time was gunpowder, which is not a [[high explosive]] and hence incapable of producing the [[shock wave]] that the shaped-charge effect requires.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Kennedy, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA220095 ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect:  The First 100 Years''] (Los Alamos, New Mexico:  Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1990),  pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true hollow charge effect was achieved in 1883, by Max von Foerster (1845–1905),&lt;ref&gt;For a brief biography of [[:de:Max von Foerster|Max von Foerster]], see the German Wikipedia article on him.&lt;/ref&gt; chief of the nitrocellulose factory of Wolff &amp; Co. in [[Walsrode]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), pp. 5 and 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

By 1886, Gustav Bloem of [[Düsseldorf]], Germany had filed {{US patent|342423}} for hemispherical cavity metal detonators to concentrate the effect of the explosion in an axial direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|inventor=Gustav Bloem|number=342423|title=Shell for detonating caps|y=1886|m=05|d=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munroe effect is named after [[Charles E. Munroe]], who discovered it in 1888.  As a civilian chemist working at the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], he noticed that when a block of explosive [[guncotton]] with the manufacturer's name stamped into it was detonated next to a metal plate, the lettering was cut into the plate. Conversely, if letters were raised in relief above the surface of the explosive, then the letters on the plate would also be raised above its surface.&lt;ref&gt;See:

However, it was not until 1932 that Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna's ''Technische Hochschule'', conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect.  When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin's ''Technische Hochschule'']], where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Carl Julius Cranz (1858–1945), see:

Although the weapon's performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with [[Hubert Schardin]] at the ''Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe'' (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut W.

By 1937, Schardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves.  It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or ''Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt'' (hollow-charge liner effect)).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by flash radiography, the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Applications==

===Modern military===
{{further|High explosive anti-tank warhead}}
The common term in military terminology for shaped charge [[warhead]]s is [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). HEAT warheads are frequently used in [[anti-tank guided missile]]s, unguided [[rocket]]s, gun-fired projectiles (both spun and unspun&lt;!--needs def of terms or wikilink to ??--&gt;), [[rifle grenade]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[bomblet]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and various other weapons.

===Non-military===
In non-military applications shaped charges are used in [[building implosion|explosive demolition of buildings and structures]], in particular for cutting through metal piles, columns and beams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/parkersburg-belpre-bridge | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/500-wood-street-building | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =500 Wood Street Building|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mondial-defence.com/2011/Products/RAZOR.html | work= Mondial Defence Systems | title =Semtex RAZOR |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boring holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | title =An Overview of the Shaped Charge Concept | first =William | last =Walters | access-date =2011-08-27 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124915/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | archive-date =2011-08-19 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[steelmaking]], small shaped charges are often used to pierce [[Tap (steelmaking)|taps]] that have become plugged with slag.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt; They are also used in quarrying, breaking up ice, breaking log jams, felling trees, and drilling post holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Shaped charges are used most extensively in the [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] industries, in particular in the [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion of oil and gas wells]], in which they are detonated to [[perforation (oil well)|perforate the metal casing]] of the well at intervals to admit the influx of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm |title=Shaped Charge |publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

A typical device consists of a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal-lined [[conical]] hollow in one end and a central [[detonator]], array of detonators, or [[detonation]] wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from ([[Normal (geometry)|normal to]]) the surface of an explosive, so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped (usually conically), the enormous [[pressure]] generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. The resulting collision forms and projects a high-velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner, a layer of about 10% to 20% of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower-moving slug of material, which, because of its appearance, is sometimes called a "carrot".

Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity, the jet's velocity also varies along its length, decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break-up into particles. Over time, the particles tend to fall out of alignment, which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

Also, at the apex of the cone, which forms the very front of the jet, the liner does not have time to be fully accelerated before it forms its part of the jet. This results in its small part of jet being projected at a lower velocity than jet formed later behind it. As a result, the initial parts of the jet coalesce to form a pronounced wider tip portion.

Most of the jet travels at [[hypersonic]] speed. The tip moves at 7 to 14&amp;nbsp;km/s, the jet tail at a lower velocity (1 to 3&amp;nbsp;km/s), and the slug at a still lower velocity (less than 1&amp;nbsp;km/s). The exact velocities depend on the charge's configuration and confinement, explosive type, materials used, and the explosive-initiation mode. At typical velocities, the penetration process generates such enormous pressures that it may be considered [[hydrodynamic]]; to a good approximation, the jet and armor may be treated as [[inviscid flow|inviscid]], [[compressible flow|compressible]] fluids (see, for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett Birkhoff|G. Birkhoff]], D.P. MacDougall, E.M. Pugh, and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G.I. Taylor]], "[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1698173]," ''J. Appl. Phys.'', vol. 19, pp. 563–582, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;), with their material strengths ignored.

A recent technique using magnetic diffusion analysis showed that the temperature of the outer 50% by volume of a copper jet tip while in flight was between 1100K and 1200K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlig |first1=W. Casey |last2=Hummer |first2=Charles |title=In-flight conductivity and temperature measurements of hypervelocity projectiles |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2013 |volume=58 |pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; much closer to the melting point of copper (1358 K) than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=William|title=Fundamentals of Shaped Charges|date=1998|publisher=CMCPress|location=Baltimore Maryland|isbn=0-471-62172-2|page=192|edition=softcover edition with corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature is consistent with a hydrodynamic calculation that simulated the entire experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sable |first1=P. |title=Characterization In-Flight Temperature of Shaped Charge Penetrators in CTH |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2017 |volume=204 |pages=375–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, two-color radiometry measurements from the late 1970s indicate lower temperatures for various shaped charge liner material, cone construction and type of explosive filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Holle |first1=W.G. |last2=Trimble |first2=J.J. |title=Temperature Measurement of Copper and Eutectic Metal Shaped Charge Jets |journal=U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory |date=1977 |issue=BRL-R-2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Comp-B loaded shaped charge with a copper liner and pointed cone apex had a jet tip temperature ranging from 668 K to 863 K over a five shot sampling. Octol-loaded charges with a rounded cone apex generally had higher surface temperatures with an average of 810 K, and the temperature of a tin-lead liner with Comp-B fill averaged 842 K. While the tin-lead jet was determined to be liquid, the copper jets are well below the melting point of copper. However, these temperatures are not completely consistent with evidence that soft recovered copper jet particles show signs of melting at the core while the outer portion remains solid and cannot be equated with bulk temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=D. H. |last2=Walters |first2=W. P. |title=Analysis of "Soft" Recovered Shaped Charge Jet Particles |date=1996 |issue=UCRL-JC-123850 |doi=10.2172/251380 |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:167531/metadc665285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close there is not enough time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such standoffs, it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long standoffs, velocity is lost to [[air drag]], further degrading penetration.

The key to the effectiveness of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic "fist to finger" action, where the size of the eventual "finger" is based on the size of the original "fist". In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700%&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140–141, addresses the reported ≈700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&amp;nbsp;mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.&lt;/ref&gt; of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for basic steel plate, not for the [[composite armor]], [[reactive armor]], or other types of modern armor.

===Liner===
The most common shape of the liner is [[cone (geometry)|conical]], with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles can result in jet [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]], or even in the failure of the jet to form at all; this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold, normally slightly higher than the liner material's bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres, tulips, trumpets, [[ellipse]]s, and bi-conics; the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Liners have been made from many materials, including various metals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a278191.pdf|title=Shaped Charge Liner Materials: Resources, Processes, Properties, Costs, and Applications, 1991|author=|date=|website=dtic.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and glass. The deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense, [[ductile]] metal, and a very common choice has been [[copper]]. For some modern anti-armor weapons, [[molybdenum]] and pseudo-alloys of [[copper-tungsten|tungsten filler and copper binder]] (9:1, thus density is ≈18&amp;nbsp;Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) have been adopted. Nearly every common metallic element has been tried, including [[aluminum]], [[tungsten]], [[tantalum]], [[depleted uranium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[zirconium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[nickel]], [[silver]], and even [[gold]] and [[platinum]]. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated; for example, aluminum has been found advantageous for [[concrete]] targets.&lt;!--List of liner materials supplemented from Kennedy, 1983--&gt;

In early antitank weapons, copper was used as a liner material. Later, in the 1970s, it was found [[tantalum]] is superior to copper, due to its much higher [[density]] and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high-density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price, toxicity, radioactivity, or lack of ductility.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Russell and Kok Loong Lee, ''Structure-Property Relations in Nonferrous Metals'' (Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 218].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the deepest penetrations, pure metals yield the best results, because they display the greatest ductility, which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for [[oil well completion]], however, it is essential that a solid slug or "carrot" not be formed, since it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry, therefore, liners are generally fabricated by [[powder metallurgy]], often of [[pseudo-alloy]]s which, if [[sintering|unsintered]], yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered [[Powder metallurgy#Powder compaction|cold pressed]] liners, however, are not waterproof and tend to be [[brittle]], which makes them easy to damage during handling. [[binary alloy|Bimetallic]] liners, usually zinc-lined copper, can be used; during jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed; the disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low-melting-point (below 500&amp;nbsp;°C) [[solder]]/[[braze]]-like alloys (e.g., Sn&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;97.6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;, or pure metals like lead, zinc or cadmium) can be used; these melt before reaching the well casing, and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys, binary [[eutectic]]s (e.g. Pb&lt;sub&gt;88.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;11.1&lt;/sub&gt;, Sn&lt;sub&gt;61.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;38.1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- Pb??? --&gt;, or Ag&lt;sub&gt;71.9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;28.1&lt;/sub&gt;), form a metal-matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]]; such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal-matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low-melting material is another option; the inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing, weakening the material, or serve as crack [[nucleation]] sites, and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase can be achieved also with castable alloys (e.g., copper) with a low-melting-point metal insoluble in copper, such as bismuth, 1–5% lithium, or up to 50% (usually 15–30%) lead; the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non-homogeneous distribution of the inclusions can also be achieved. Other additives can modify the alloy properties; tin (4–8%), nickel (up to 30% and often together with tin), up to 8% aluminium, [[phosphorus]] (forming brittle phosphides) or 1–5% [[silicon]] form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30% zinc can be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5098487.html|title=Copper alloys for shaped charge liners - Olin Corporation|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density, therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double-layer liners, with one layer of a less dense but [[pyrophoric]] metal (e.g. [[aluminum]] or [[magnesium]]), can be used to enhance [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] effects following the armor-piercing action; [[explosive welding]] can be used for making those, as then the metal-metal interface is homogeneous, does not contain significant amount of [[intermetallics]], and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;"Method of making a bimetallic shaped-charge liner" {{US patent|4807795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet, which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Held.

The jet tail reaches about 2–5&amp;nbsp;km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are [[face-centered cubic]] metals, as they are the most ductile, but even [[graphite]] and zero-ductility [[ceramic]] cones show significant penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Doig, "[http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf Some metallurgical aspects of shaped charge liners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724081452/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 1, no. 1, March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

For optimal penetration, a high explosive with a high detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is [[HMX]] (octogen), although never in its pure form, as it would be too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], with which it forms [[Octol]]. Other common high-performance explosives are [[RDX]]-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form [[Composition B]] and the [[Cyclotol]]s) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered [[aluminum]] to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive [[CL-20]] in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been in the form of the PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).

===Other features===
A 'waveshaper' is a body (typically a disc or cylindrical block) of an inert material (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive for the purpose of changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a waveshaper can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a waveshaper.&lt;!--See U.S. Patent 2,809,585, Oct. 15, 1957--&gt;

Another useful design feature is ''sub-calibration'', the use of a liner having a smaller diameter (caliber) than the explosive charge. In an ordinary charge, the explosive near the base of the cone is so thin that it is unable to accelerate the adjacent liner to sufficient velocity to form an effective jet. In a sub-calibrated charge, this part of the device is effectively cut off, resulting in a shorter charge with the same performance.

==Defences==
During [[World War II]], the precision of the charge's construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given cone diameter and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, [[spaced armour|side and turret skirts]] (known as ''Schürzen'') fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary [[anti-tank rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7rrMe15jhwC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=when+was+schurzen+introduced%3F%3F |title= Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf.G, H and J 1942–45 |author1=Hilary L. Doyle |author2=Thomas L. Jentz |author3=Tony Bryan  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence also reduce HEAT penetration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The use of add-on [[spaced armor]] skirts on armored vehicles may have the opposite effect and actually ''increase'' the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in the length of the projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff.&lt;ref&gt;WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim (1999) - Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 24 - Effectiveness Factors for Explosive Reactive Armour Systems - page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Skirting should not be confused with [[cage armor]] which is used to damage the fusing system of [[RPG-7]] projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer [[ogive]]s and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's [[piezoelectric]] nose probe and rear [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] assembly. Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream.  If the nose probe strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.

==Variants==
There are several different forms of shaped charge.

===Linear shaped charges===
[[File:LinearShapedCharge.png|thumb|upright|Linear shaped charge]]
A linear shaped charge (LSC) has a lining with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is surrounded with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves to protect the explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. "At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse–creating the cutting force."&lt;ref&gt;Accurate Energetic Systems LLC [http://www.aesys.biz/wp-content/uploads/14-102_liner-shaped-charge.pdf]" Linear Shape Charge&lt;/ref&gt;  The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth depending on the size and materials used in the charge. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of rolled steel joists (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the [[Building implosion|controlled demolition]] of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of [[multistage rocket]]s.

===Explosively formed penetrator===
{{Main|Explosively formed penetrator}}

[[File:explosively formed penetrator.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Formation of an EFP warhead. [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Research Laboratory]]

The explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is also known as the self-forging fragment (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay-Schardin]] (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).

The EFP is relatively unaffected by first-generation [[reactive armor]] and can travel up to perhaps 1000 charge diameters (CD)s before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or successfully hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a ball or slug EFP normally causes a large-diameter but relatively shallow hole, of, at most, a couple of CDs. If the EFP perforates the armor, [[spalling]] and extensive behind armor effects (BAE, also called behind armor damage, BAD) will occur. The BAE is mainly caused by the high-temperature and high-velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and the blast [[overpressure]] caused by this debris. More modern EFP warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce long-rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned rod/slug projectiles. The long-rods are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAE, multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles are much more accurate.

The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of main battle tanks (MBT) such as the top, belly and rear armored areas. It is well suited for the attack of other less heavily protected armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and in the breaching of material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs. Weapons using the EFP principle have already been used in combat; the "[[smart weapon|smart]]" submunitions in the [[CBU-97]] [[cluster bomb]] used by the US Air Force and Navy in the 2003 Iraq war employed this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided [[artillery shell]]s under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectile (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use EFP principle. Examples of EFP warheads are US patents 5038683&lt;ref&gt;Ernest L.Baker, Pai-Lien Lu, Brian Fuchs and Barry Fishburn(1991)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/High_explosive_assembly_for_projecting_h.pdf?id=2dkbAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uJ8lS6CfmjJo1JKILjvWDC9sCSg High explosive assembly for projecting high velocity long rods]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US6606951.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S.Klein (2003) "[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Bounding_anti_tank_anti_vehicle_weapon.pdf?id=oOoMAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3WM4xBQ5f0d23uQdUeF1unjyGE9Q Bounding Anti-tank/Anti-vehicle weapon]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem warhead===
Some modern anti-tank rockets ([[RPG-27]], [[RPG-29]]) and missiles ([[BGM-71 TOW|TOW 2B]], [[ERYX]], [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]], [[MILAN]]) use a [[tandem warhead]] shaped charge, consisting of two separate shaped charges, one in front of the other, typically with some distance between them. TOW-2A was the first to use tandem warheads in the mid-1980s, an aspect of the weapon which the US Army had to reveal under news media and Congressional pressure resulting from the concern that NATO antitank missiles were ineffective against Soviet tanks that were fitted with the new [[Reactive armour|ERA boxes]].  The Army revealed that a 40&amp;nbsp;mm precursor shaped charge warhead was fitted on the tip of the TOW-2B collapsible probe.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman A. "ARMY ANTITANK CANDIDATES PROLIFERATE" Armed Forces Journal International/December 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the front charge is somewhat smaller than the rear one, as it is intended primarily to disrupt ERA boxes or tiles. Examples of tandem warheads are US patents 7363862&lt;ref&gt;Jason C.Gilliam and Darin L.Kielsmeier(2008)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Multi_purpose_single_initiated_tandem_wa.pdf?id=Nt-qAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0l5gTdL-TqxXkvATTpIYTVLeAg2g Multi-purpose single initiated tandem warhead]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US 5561261.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Lindstadt and Manfred Klare(1996)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Tandem_warhead_with_a_secondary_projecti.pdf?id=icslAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nqrCamThCu2bvHpqBNleeq4ssfQ Tandem warhead with a secondary projectile]"&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] antiarmor missile is one of the few that have accomplished the complex engineering feat of having two shaped charges of the same diameter stacked in one warhead.  Recently, a Russian arms firm revealed a 125mm tank cannon round with two same diameter shaped charges one behind the other, but with the back one offset so its penetration stream will not interfere with the front shaped charge's penetration stream.  The reasoning behind both the Hellfire and the Russian 125&amp;nbsp;mm munitions having tandem same diameter warheads is not to increase penetration, but to increase the [[beyond-armour effect|beyond-armor effect]].

===Voitenko compressor===
{{Main|Voitenko compressor}}
In 1964 a Russian scientist proposed that a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor be adapted to the task of accelerating shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;Войтенко (Voitenko), А.Е. (1964) "Получение газовых струй большой скорости" (Obtaining high speed gas jets), ''Доклады Академии Наук СССР'' (Reports of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR), '''158''' : 1278-1280.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting device, looking a little like a wind tunnel, is called a Voitenko compressor.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-440/ch6-15.htm The Suicidal Wind Tunnel]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable [[steel]] plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was 220,000 feet per second (67&amp;nbsp;km/s). The apparatus exposed to the detonation was completely destroyed, but not before useful data was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm Shaped Charge History]"&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates [[hydrogen]] gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosive Accelerators"[http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SPBI134.HTM Voitenko Implosion Gun]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I.

===Nuclear shaped charges===
The proposed [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion nuclear propulsion]] system would have required the development of [[nuclear shaped charge]]s for reaction acceleration of spacecraft. Shaped charge effects driven by nuclear explosions have been discussed speculatively, but are not known to have been produced in fact.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gsponer (2008) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510071v5 Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons: Military Effectiveness and Collateral Effects]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, George, ''Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965'', p. 113. {{ISBN|0-14-027732-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, ''Project Orion'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the early nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] was quoted as saying, in the context of shaped charges, ''"A one-kiloton fission device, shaped properly, could make a hole ten feet in diameter a thousand feet into solid rock."''&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, John, ''The Curve of Binding Energy'', p.159 {{ISBN|0-374-51598-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a nuclear driven [[explosively formed penetrator]] was apparently proposed for terminal ballistic missile defense in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosively Produced Flechettes; JASON report 66-121, Institute for Defense Analysis, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. Richard Blankenbecler http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5196.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
One of Davies's first journal publications was 'The Expression of Emotion in Music', published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1980 (Vol. 89, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–86). In this article Davies first outlined his theory that music is expressive of emotions in virtue of resembling the way that emotions appear. This theory is similar to one outlined by [[Peter Kivy]] in his book ''The Corded Shell'', also published in 1980. However, Davies developed his view independently as an undergraduate in the 1970s, and the theory was part of his PhD thesis awarded in 1976 from the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kivy, Davies also places a greater emphasis on the resemblance between music and physical gesture, where Kivy tends to emphasize the resemblance to the expressive vocalisations. Davies was inspired when seeing an advertisement for [[Hush Puppies]] shoes, with the thought that we recognize sadness in the face of [[Basset Hound|Basset hounds]], despite knowing that they do not feel sad.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also maintains a research interest in ethnomusicology, which he studied as an undergraduate,&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aesthetics of [[Music of Bali|Balinese music]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., his article [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00234.x/abstract;jsessionid=BB7C33A7CCC63E4294B8FD7B672294D6.d03t01 'Balinese Aesthetics']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Strong theologian - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|James Strong (1822–1894)]]
{{italic title}}
'''''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible''''',{{refn|group=n|The complete title of the original work was ''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible: Showing Every Word of the Text of the Common English Version of the Canonical Books, and Every Occurrence of Each Word in Regular Order: Together with A Comparative Concordance of the Authorized and Revised Versions, Including the American Variations; Also Brief Dictionaries of the Hebrew and Greek Words of the Original, with References to the English Words''.{{sfnp|Strong|1890|p=1}}}} generally known as '''''Strong's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance]], an index of every word in the [[King James Version]] (KJV), constructed under the direction of [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]. Strong first published his ''Concordance'' in 1890, while professor of [[Exegesis|exegetical]] [[theology]] at [[Drew University|Drew Theological Seminary]].

[[File:Strongs Concordances.png|thumb|Editions and reprints of ''Strong's Concordance'', now in public domain]]

==Purpose==
The purpose of ''Strong's Concordance'' is not to provide content or commentary about the Bible, but to provide an [[Index (publishing)|index]] to the Bible. This allows the reader to find words where they appear in the Bible. This index allows a student of the Bible to re-find a phrase or passage previously studied. It also lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used elsewhere in the Bible. In this way Strong provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of text.

==Strong's numbers==
Each original-language word is given an entry number in the dictionary of those original language words listed in the back of the concordance. These have become known as the "Strong's numbers". The main concordance lists each word that appears in the [[KJV Bible]] in alphabetical order with each verse in which it appears listed in order of its appearance in the Bible, with a snippet of the surrounding text (including the word in italics). Appearing to the right of the scripture reference is the Strong's number. This allows the user of the concordance to look up the meaning of the original language word in the associated dictionary in the back, thereby showing how the original language word was translated into the English word in the KJV Bible.

''Strong's Concordance'' includes:
* The 8674 [[biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] root words used in the [[Old Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Hebrew|582}}'')
* The 5624 [[koine Greek|Greek]] root words used in the [[New Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Greek|3056}}'')

New editions of ''Strong's'' may exclude the comparative section (1611 KJV to 1614) and the asterisks that denote differential definitions of the same Hebrew or Greek words; due perhaps to denominational considerations, definitions may also be altered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

Although the Greek words in ''Strong's Concordance'' are numbered 1–5624, the numbers 2717 and 3203–3302 are unassigned due to "changes in the enumeration while in progress". Not every distinct word is assigned a number, but only the root words. For example, αγαπησεις is assigned the same number as αγαπατε – both are listed as {{Strong Greek|25}} αγαπαω.

Other authors have used Strong's numbers in concordances of other Bible translations, such as the ''[[New International Version]]'' and ''[[American Standard Version]]''.

Due to Strong's numbers it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible ("Новая учебная Библия Томпсона", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society "The Bible for everyone", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible]] (''The New Thompson Study Bible,'' La Buona Novella Inc. &amp; B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

New editions of ''Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible'' remain in print {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}.

==Strong's Dictionaries==
In the 1890 version, Strong added a "Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary" and a "Greek Dictionary of the New Testament" to his concordance. In the preface to both dictionaries, Strong explains that these are "brief and simple" dictionaries, not meant to replace reference to "a more copious and elaborate Lexicon." He mentions [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]] and [[Bible concordance#Hebrew|Fürst]] as examples of the lexicons that Strong's is drawn from. His dictionaries were meant to give students a quick and simple way to look up words and have a general idea of their meaning.

Strong reportedly based his lexicons on the work of contemporary scholars such as Gesenius, Fürst, [[A Greek-English Lexicon|Liddell &amp; Scott]], [[Joseph Henry Thayer|Thayer]], and [[Brown-Driver-Briggs|Brown, Driver, and Briggs]]. According to the preface, he and his team also made "numerous original suggestions, relations, and distinctions... especially in the affinities of roots and the classification of meanings." The work is intended to represent the best of 19th century scholarship, and both a simplification of it and an improvement on it. An important feature of Strong's dictionaries is the listing of every translation of a source word in the [[King James Version|AV (King James)]] after the definition itself.

It is important to note Strong's association with the committee working on the [[American Standard Version|American]] [[Revised Version|Revised Version]] of the Bible. His work does not tend to support the authority of the King James Version. He was part of the effort to update and replace it with what the translators believed would be a better version. As a result, he contributed deeper and more thorough study of Biblical languages, especially etymology, but also an inherently suspicious attitude toward the [[Textus Receptus]], the King James, and toward traditional, less "secular" definitions of original words. The translation committee was associated with the [[Historical criticism|Higher Critical]] movement and with the [[Westcott-Hort]] version of the Greek text. Strong, a Methodist layman and college professor, was acceptable to the committee, but one cannot assume he shared all of its views.&lt;ref name="Strong Delusion"&gt;[http://www.avpublications.com/avnew/downloads/PDF/HazMat/H-pp_157-202_Chapter_7_Strong_Delusion-James_Strongs_Dang.pdf], This is a hostile source but it cites original sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''System analysis''' in the field of [[electrical engineering]] that characterizes electrical systems and their properties.  System analysis can be used to represent almost anything from population growth to audio speakers; electrical engineers often use it because of its direct relevance to many areas of their discipline, most notably [[signal processing]], [[Telecommunications|communication systems]] and [[Control theory|control systems]].

== Characterization of systems ==
A system is characterized by how it responds to input [[Electrical signal|signals]].  In general, a system has one or more input signals and one or more output signals.  Therefore, one natural characterization of systems is by how many inputs and outputs they have:
* ''[[Single-input single-output system|SISO]]'' (Single Input, Single Output)
* ''SIMO'' (Single Input, Multiple Outputs)
* ''MISO'' (Multiple Inputs, Single Output)
* ''[[Multiple-input multiple-output system|MIMO]]'' (Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs)

It is often useful (or necessary) to break up a system into smaller pieces for analysis.  Therefore, we can regard a SIMO system as multiple SISO systems (one for each output), and similarly for a MIMO system.  By far, the greatest amount of work in system analysis has been with SISO systems, although many parts inside SISO systems have multiple inputs (such as adders).

Signals can be [[Continuous signal|continuous]] or [[discrete signal|discrete]] in time, as well as continuous or discrete in the values they take at any given time:
* Signals that are continuous in time and continuous in value are known as ''[[analog signal]]s''.
* Signals that are discrete in time and discrete in value are known as ''[[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s''.
* Signals that are discrete in time and continuous in value are called ''discrete-time signals''. [[Switched capacitor]] systems, for instance, are often used in integrated circuits.  The methods developed for analyzing discrete time signals and systems are usually applied to digital and analog signals and systems.
* Signals that are continuous in time and discrete in value are sometimes seen in the timing analysis of [[Digital circuit|logic circuits]] or [[PWM amplifier]]s, but have little to no use in system analysis.

With this categorization of signals, a system can then be characterized as to which type of signals it deals with:
* A system that has analog input and analog output is known as an ''analog system''.
* A system that has digital input and digital output is known as a ''digital system''.
* Systems with analog input and digital output or digital input and analog output are possible.  However, it is usually easiest to break these systems up for analysis into their analog and digital parts, as well as the necessary [[analog to digital converter|analog to digital]] or [[digital to analog converter]].

Another way to characterize systems is by whether their output at any given time depends only on the input at that time or perhaps on the input at some time in the past (or in the future!).
* ''Memoryless'' systems do not depend on any past input. In common usage memoryless systems are also independent of future inputs. An interesting consequence of this is that the impulse response of any memoryless system is itself a scaled impulse.
* Systems ''with memory'' do depend on past input.
* ''Causal'' systems do not depend on any future input.
* ''Non-causal'' or ''anticipatory'' systems do depend on future input. 
*:Note: It is not possible to physically realize a non-causal system operating in "real time".  However, from the standpoint of analysis, they are important for two reasons.  First, the ideal system for a given application is often a noncausal system, which although not physically possible can give insight into the design of a derived causal system to accomplish a similar purpose.  Second, there are instances when a system does not operate in "real time" but is rather simulated "off-line" by a computer, such as post-processing an audio or video recording.
*:Further, some non-causal systems can operate in pseudo-real time by introducing lag: if a system depends on input for 1 second in future, it can process in real time with 1 second lag.

Analog systems with memory may be further classified as ''lumped'' or ''distributed''.  The difference can be explained by considering the meaning of memory in a system.  Future output of a system with memory depends on future input and a number of state variables, such as values of the input or output at various times in the past.  If the number of state variables necessary to describe future output is finite, the system is lumped; if it is infinite, the system is distributed.

Finally, systems may be characterized by certain properties which facilitate their analysis:
* A system is ''[[linear system|linear]]'' if it has the superposition and scaling properties. A system that is not linear is ''[[non-linear]]''.
* If the output of a system does not depend explicitly on time, the system is said to be [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]]; otherwise it is [[time-variant system|time-variant]]
* A system that will always produce the same output for a given input is said to be [[deterministic system|deterministic]].
* A system that will produce different outputs for a given input is said to be [[stochastic]].

There are many methods of analysis developed specifically for linear time-invariant (''LTI'') deterministic systems.  Unfortunately, in the case of analog systems, none of these properties are ever perfectly achieved.  Linearity implies that operation of a system can be scaled to arbitrarily large magnitudes, which is not possible.  Time-invariance is violated by aging effects that can change the outputs of analog systems over time (usually years or even decades).  [[Thermal noise]] and other random phenomena ensure that the operation of any analog system will have some degree of stochastic behavior.  Despite these limitations, however, it is usually reasonable to assume that deviations from these ideals will be small.

== LTI Systems ==
{{main|LTI system theory}}
As mentioned above, there are many methods of analysis developed specifically for [[LTI system theory|LTI systems]].  This is due to their simplicity of specification.  An [[LTI system theory|LTI system]] is completely specified by its [[transfer function]] (which is a [[rational function]] for digital and lumped analog LTI systems).  Alternatively, we can think of an LTI system being completely specified by its [[frequency response]].  A third way to specify an LTI system is by its characteristic [[linear differential equation]] (for analog systems) or linear [[difference equation]] (for digital systems).  Which description is most useful depends on the application.

The distinction between [[Lumped element model | lumped]] and [[Distributed element model | distributed]] LTI systems is important.  A lumped LTI system is specified by a finite number of parameters, be it the [[zeros and poles]] of its transfer function, or the [[coefficient]]s of its differential equation, whereas specification of a distributed LTI system requires a complete [[Function (mathematics)|function]]

'''Ultraviolet astronomy''' is the observation of [[electromagnetic radiation]] at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 [[Nanometre|nanometres]]; shorter wavelengths&amp;mdash;higher energy photons&amp;mdash;are studied by [[X-ray astronomy]] and [[gamma ray astronomy]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
Ultraviolet [[Spectral line|line spectrum]] measurements ([[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]]) are used to discern the chemical composition, densities, and temperatures of the [[interstellar medium]], and the temperature and composition of hot young stars. UV observations can also provide essential information about the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]].

The ultraviolet [[universe]] looks quite different from the familiar [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] seen in [[visible light]].
Most stars are actually relatively cool objects emitting much of their electromagnetic radiation in the visible or near-[[infrared]] part of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation is the signature of hotter objects, typically in the early and late stages of their [[stellar evolution|evolution]]. In the Earth's sky seen in ultraviolet light, most stars would fade in prominence. Some very young massive stars and some very old stars and galaxies, growing hotter and producing higher-energy radiation near their birth or death, would be visible. Clouds of gas and dust would block the vision in many directions along the [[Milky Way]].

Space-based solar observatories such as [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] use ultraviolet telescopes (called [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|AIA]] and [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope|EIT]], respectively) to view activity on the Sun and its [[corona]]. Weather satellites such as the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-R]] series also carry [[GOES-16#Sun-facing|telescopes]] for observing the sun in ultraviolet.

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer|FUSE]] have been the most recent major [[space telescope]]s to view the near and far UV [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on smaller observatories such as [[GALEX]], as well as [[sounding rockets]] and the [[Space Shuttle]].

[[Charles Stuart Bowyer]] is generally given credit for starting this field.
