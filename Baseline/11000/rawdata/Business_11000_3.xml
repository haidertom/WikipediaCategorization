== History ==

=== Formation and early years  ===
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]]&lt;ref name=WBBM11&gt;{{cite news |title=Accenture To Add 500 Jobs in Chicago |last1= |first1= |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/10/11/accenture-to-add-500-jobs-in-chicago/ |newspaper=[[WBBM-TV]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for [[General Electric]] to install a computer at [[Appliance Park]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]],&lt;ref name=Brachear05&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Glickauf Jr. 1912-2005 |last1=Brachear |first1=Manya A. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-28/news/0507280218_1_arthur-andersen-electronic-computer-ham-radio-operator |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=28 July 2005 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to GE's installation of a [[UNIVAC I]] computer and printer,&lt;ref name=Betts01&gt;{{cite news |title=GE's Appliance Park Still an IT Innovator |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590401/computer-hardware/ge-s-appliance-park-still-an-it-innovator.html |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Betts90&gt;{{cite news |title=The Univac I: First in the field |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7vRlroiLwsC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=the+univac+I:+first+in+the+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixt7jAx9TJAhXDHD4KHawvBl4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20univac%20I%3A%20first%20in%20the%20field&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=2 July 1990 |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Glickauf]], an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.&lt;ref name=Brachear05/&gt;

===Split from Arthur Andersen===
In 1989, [[Arthur Andersen]] and Andersen Consulting became separate units of [[Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative]] (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and [[Arthur Andersen]]. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into [[escrow]] and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=8 August 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of Accenture ===
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/6509708 Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture – 26 Oct. 2000]; InformationWeek&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AccentureNYSE.jpg|thumb|right|Accenture's banner hanging on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ([[NYSE]]) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.]]
On 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering ([[initial public offering|IPO]]) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE); [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/19/deals/accenture/index.htm Accenture IPO gains in first trades – 19 Jul. 2001]; CNN Money&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bermuda headquarters ===
In October 2002, the Congressional [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03194r.pdf Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated Offshore]; United States General Accounting Office; 1 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former [[CNN]] journalist [[Lou Dobbs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Lou|title=Exporting America|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/commentary/dobbs/dobbs/index.htm|accessdate=3 May 2011|publisher=CNN|date=9 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US [[tax avoidance]] ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503215542/http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html|date=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated  Offshore|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/100/91572.html|website=gao.gov|publisher=General Accounting Office|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accenture engaged in an [[NHS Connecting for Health|IT overhaul project]] for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.&lt;ref name=nhswithdraw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/28/news.business|title=Accenture to quit NHS technology overhaul|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the [[United Kingdom]] ultimately abandoned the project five years later for the same reasons.&lt;ref name=nhscancel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pulls-the-plug-on-its-11bn-it-system-2330906.html|title=NHS pulls the plug on its £11bn IT system|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland headquarters ===
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its board of directors unanimously approved changing the company's place of incorporation from [[Bermuda]] to [[Ireland]] and would become '''Accenture plc'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4830 |title=Accenture Newsroom: Accenture Announces Proposed Change of Incorporation to Ireland |publisher=newsroom.accenture.com |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accenture was chosen to replace [[CGI Group]] as the lead contractor for [[HealthCare.gov]] in January 2014.&lt;ref name=healthgov&gt;{{cite web|title=Accenture chosen as lead contractor of Obamacare website|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accenture-chosen-lead-contractor-obamacare-website-government-220550193--sector.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/accenture-wins-new-563m-contract-for-healthcare-gov.html Becker's Healthcare]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the United States Department of Defense awarded a major [[Electronic Health Records]] contract to [[Cerner]], [[Leidos]] and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture Federal Services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist, while Cerner is the prime contractor.&lt;ref name=Mukherjee&gt;{{cite web|author=Sy Mukherjee|url=http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cerner-leidos-accenture-win-massive-43b-defense-department-ehr-contra/403130/|
title=Cerner, Leidos, &amp; Accenture win massive $4.3B Defense Department EHR contract|work=Healthcare Dive|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2017, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]. announced a partnership with Accenture to create [[iOS]] business solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/08/apple-and-accenture-partner-to-create-ios-business-solutions/|title=Apple and Accenture partner to create iOS business solutions|work=Apple Newsroom|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Accenture generated controversy over the amount the firm has been charging to recruit 7,500 [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] officers. Under the $297 million contract, Accenture had been charging the US Government nearly $40,000 per hire, which is more than the annual salary of the average officer.&lt;ref name=Lanard&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/border-patrol-is-so-desperate-for-new-agents-its-spending-millions-to-help-recruits-finish-their-applications-1/ |title= Border Patrol Is So Desperate for New Agents, It’s Spending Millions to Help Recruits Finish Their Applications |author =NOAH LANARD |date=14 June 2018 |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2018, Accenture reported earnings of US$4.060 billion, with an annual revenue of US$41.603 billion, an increase of 13.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Accenture's shares traded at over $159 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$104.2 billion in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ACN/accenture/total-assets|title=Accenture Total Assets 2006-2018 {{!}} ACN|website=www.macrotrends.net|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé==
[[File:Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé (logo).svg|thumb|right|Logo of the Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé]]
The '''Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé''' ('''French Agency for the Safety of Health Products'''), often abbreviated AFSSAPS or AFSSaPS, was a [[French government]] institution whose main mission was to assess health risks posed by health products intended for human consumption, particularly [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. It was responsible for issuing permits for marketing approval and became the single authority in the regulation of biomedical research.

The agency was latest headed by [[Dominique Maraninchi]] and had about 1,000 employees plus 2,000 experts. Its budget amounts to approximately 157 million euros, with the bulk of revenue came from taxes and charges levied on the activity of the pharmaceutical industry.

The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM), superseded the tasks and duties of the AFSSAPS on 1 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/L-ANSM2/Une-agence-d-expertise/L-ANSM-agence-d-evaluation-d-expertise-et-de-decision/(offset)/0 |title=L'ANSM, agence d'évaluation, d'expertise et de décision - ANSM : Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé |language=fr |publisher=Ansm.sante.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''book-to-bill ratio''', also known as the '''BB ratio''' or '''BO/BI ratio''',{{r|web}} is the ratio of orders received to the amount  billed for a specific period, usually one month or one quarter. It is widely used in the technology sector and especially in the semiconductor industry, where the semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) book-to-bill ratio is considered an important [[Economic_indicator#Leading_indicators|leading indicator]] of demand trends.

A book-to-bill ratio above one means that more orders were received than filled, indicating strong demand, while a ratio below one indicates weak demand.{{r|web}}

==Reports==
===SEMI===
[[Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International]] (SEMI) publishes a monthly book-to-bill report for SME manufacturers headquartered in North America. The report is based on confidential bookings and billings data for 22 different equipment categories, broken down into seven regions: "North America", "Japan", "Europe", "Taiwan", "Korea", "China", and "Rest of World".&lt;ref name=SEMIData&gt;{{cite web|title=SEMI Data Collection Programs.|url=http://www.semi.org/en/marketinfo/P037878|publisher=SEMI|accessdate=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEAJ===
The Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan (SEAJ) publishes monthly book-to-bill reports for SME, LCD, and related equipment manufacturers headquartered in Japan. Like the SEMI reports, the SEAJ reports are based on three-month moving averages. Detailed reports are available to SEAJ members and manufacturers who participate in the SEAJ data collection program.&lt;ref name=SEAJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical data|url=http://www.seaj.or.jp/english/statistics/page_en.php?CMD=1|publisher=SEAJ|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, Japanese and North American SME manufacturers each accounted for more than 40% of the world market.&lt;ref name=USITC2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry &amp; Trade Summary: Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment|url=http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub3868.pdf|publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPC===
[[IPC (electronics)|IPC]], the trade association of the electronics interconnect and packaging industry, distributes monthly market reports for the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and printed circuit board (PCB) segments. The reports provide recent data on market size and near-term forecasts, and include book-to-bill data. They are available free to participating manufacturers and by subscription.&lt;ref name=MarketResearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Research from IPC |url=http://www.ipc.org/3.0_Industry/3.2_Market_Research/2014/market-research-reports.html |publisher=IPC |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottega Giotti''' is a [[Florence]]-based fashion company that specializes in ''intrecciato'' (woven) leather jackets, bags and small leather goods. Started by a local artisan in the beginning of the 20th century, it grew into an international company headquartered in [[Lenzi Palace]] in the center of Florence. The company was founded and is still owned and managed by the Biagotti family.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===

The family tradition started with Attilio Biagiotti who owned a leather workshop located behind Piazza Pitti. After the second world war in 1950 Gino together with his son Mario, due to the arrival in Florence of numerous tourists from all over the world, decided to re-open the Bottega Giotti store in the Lenzi Palace.
[[File:Store BG.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bottega Giotti store in Florence, Italy]]

=== 21st century ===

The company is run by the owner Mario Biagiotti along with his daughter Alessandra, designer of the Bottega Giotti collection and his son Paolo.

In the beginning of the 2000s Bottega Giotti started exporting leather goods to the United States for online sales. Export further grew to other European countries followed by opening of stores in [[Taipei]] and soon-to-be-open [[Moscow]] boutique in 2014.

Due to increased sales Bottega Giotti moved production from [[Tuscany]] to a large factory in the [[Marche]] region of Italy.

== Products ==
[[File:Процесс создания плетения "Intrecciato".jpeg|thumb|Creating an "Intrecciato" bag]]
Bottega Giotti has gained significant popularity for featherlight woven ''intrecciato'' leather goods, even though plain leather bags are offered as well. Currently the company produces leather bags, accessories, evening bags, briefcases, wallets, belts and leather coats and jackets for men and women (some lined in fur).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">The [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) ''Aviation Safety Award'', also known as the ''Safety "S"'', is awarded annually to [[U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] aviation units operating under Navy chains of command. 

==Selection ==
[[Image:Safety S on S-3B Viking.png|thumb|Capital letter "S" painted on the side of this [[S-3B Viking]] indicates that the squadron was the recipient of the annual CNO Aviation Safety Award. The slashes under the letter indicate multiple year awards.]]  One squadron from each type aircraft (e.g. [[E-2 Hawkeye]], [[FA-18 Hornet]], [[P-3 Orion]], etc.) from each coast (i.e. East and West) is chosen.  For example, one [[SH-60 Seahawk]] squadron from [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia and one SH-60 squadron from [[NAS North Island]], California is chosen each year.  Marine squadrons that deploy with Navy units are also eligible.  Selected squadrons receive engraved plaques and citations for permanent display, and are also entitled to paint a prominent "S" on their aircraft until the next year's selections are made.

==Criteria==
Selection of winners is based on aircraft flight mishap rates, ground mishaps, currency of safety programs, flight exposure (aircraft-days embarked aboard ship (if appropriate), aircraft-day deployed away from home base (if applicable), etc.).  Subjective criteria are also used.  These include quality contributions to the Naval Aviation Safety Program, such as timely reporting of hazards, recommendations for corrective action, safety articles for publication, suggestions for improvement in equipment (survival, aircraft, ground support, etc.) facilities, and maintenance practices, and other matters considered appropriate.

'''Chowking''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:超|超]][[wikt:群|群]]}}) is a [[Philippines|Philippine]]-based [[restaurant]] [[Chain store|chain]]. The concept combines Western [[Fast food restaurant|fast food]] service with [[Chinese food]] menu. Chowking predominantly sells [[noodle]] soups, [[dim sum]] and [[rice]] bowls with toppings. Chowking set up its first store in 1985 under the company of Robert Kuan at a time when [[American cuisine|American]]-style burger joints were dominating the Philippine fast food scene.

After [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]] (JFC) acquired Chowking, the brand was place under Fresh N Famous Foods, a JFC subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fresh N' Famous Foods Inc Company Profile|url=https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/PH/Fresh_N__Famous_Foods_Inc_en_3853506.html|website=EMIS|accessdate=1 November 2017|quote=Fresh N' Famous Foods Inc, a subsidiary of Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) operates and franchises quick-service restaurants under the trade names "Chowking" and "Greenwich"; Red Ribbon Bakeshop, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1989, Chowking started expanding its [[market share]] amid the volatility of the domestic market. It opened its [[franchising]] operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chowking Franchise in the Philippines|url=http://franchisephilippines.org/chowking-franchise-in-the-philippines|work=Franchise Philippines|publisher=Franchise Philippines|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=JIp|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made its entry into the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provincial]] markets the same year. On January 1, 2000, Chowking became a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]]. The new owner commenced store [[renovation]]s to create a new [[Corporation|corporate]] look for Chowking that would result in a comprehensive change for each store.

==Expansion==

===2018===
Chowking opened its first store in the United States through a franchise agreement with a US-based Filipino-American Company.

===2019===
Chowking entered [[Jakarta]], the capital of Indonesia and maintained two key stores to study the feasibility of the market. At this time, the company began to explore other potential locations and key cities as part of its long term expansion plans.

In the Philippines, the company received the coveted “Marketing Company of the Year” award from the Philippines Marketing Association and also attained its second “Hall of Fame for Most Outstanding Filipino Franchise” award from the Philippines Franchise Association.

===2006===
In 2006, the Chowking Food Corporation opened a United Arab Emirates (UAE) store location, increasing its international presence to seventeen outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chowking steps up global forays|url=http://philbiznews.blogspot.com/2006/03/chowking-steps-up-global-forays.html|accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=Manilla Bulletin|date=26 March 2006|author=Manilla Bulletin (posted by Rex Crisostomo)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
To ensure its continued growth, Chowking explored markets outside the Philippines. In 2008, Chowking had over 400 stores within the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[United States]] and the [[Middle East]]. Chowking has steadily been expanding its network in and around the Philippines. It is able to ensure the freshness of its food and the reliability of its supply through its main commissaries in Highland, [[Muntinlupa]] and Sucat, [[Parañaque]], as well as satellite commissaries in [[Pangasinan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Bulacan]], [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Iloilo]], [[Cebu]], [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Davao City|Davao]]. In [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], Chowking's commissary serves ten stores and is expanding to other areas.

In 2008, Chowking announced the completion of a Php270-million (USD 5.65-million) modernization program, which will help set the stage for the company’s future growth. Called “Project DMSSM”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chowking - PRESS RELEASES|url=http://www.pressroom.ph/LM/profile/id-1222499445967/page-PR/Chowking.html|work=PRessroom|publisher=Writers Edge Philippines|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced “dimsum”) for “Designed, Modernized and Streamlined Supply Chain and Manufacturing,” the two-year modernization program that started in 2006 involves the expansion and renovation of Chowking’s Noodle Building, increased automation, and the improved integration of food manufacturing processes in its two commissaries in [[Muntinlupa City]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===2011===
Jollibee acquired control over the franchised operations of Chowking USA, following the expiration of the pioneering franchise agreement.

As of April 2011, Chowking operates in key international cities in the USA, Indonesia (2),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chowking Jakarta BEEF BROCCOLI|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRxBhdiYg3Q|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=luiszabalajr|format=Video upload|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Arab Emirates (17), [[Qatar]] (2) and [[Oman]] (1).

In Indonesia, as part of Chowking's ethos of adaptation with local tastes and cultures, the company is one of the first restaurants to be [[Halal]]-certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.facebook.com/chowkingindonesia/info|work=Chowking Indonesia PT|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Chowking Indonesia PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  courtesy of the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI)]]. The number of customers grew as a result of the certification and a strong Indonesian-Muslim customer profile was captured in their stores.

==Sponsored events==
Chowking is also active in the organization of Filipino events in [[Jakarta]].

The brand was a partner in the "[[Manny Pacquiao]] vs. [[Juan Manuel Marquez]] 3" boxing fundraiser event, together with San Miguel Indonesia, the [[Four Asian Tigers]] and the Philippine Embassy in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAKARTA- EXCITED PINOYS AND OTHERS, GATHERED FOR PACQUIAO-MARQUEZ 3|url=http://junglemonkeyz.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/jakarta-excited-pinoys-and-others-gathered-for-pacquiao-marquez-3/|work=junglemonkeyz|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=junglemonkeyz|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds were donated to the Jollibee Foundation in 2011 for the benefit of Filipino [[typhoon]] victims.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Chowking also partnered with the London School of Public Relations-Jakarta for the latter's first Quadmedia Competition, where students pitched their advertising concepts to a panel of judges consisting of industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSPR 1st QuadMedia Competition Presented by Chowking|url=http://www.lspr.edu/newsonline/?p=2170|work=LSPR News Online|publisher=LSPR News Online|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=LSPR News Online|date=25 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114151531/http://www.lspr.edu/newsonline/?p=2170|archivedate=14 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">The '''Columbus Atlantic Trophy''' is an award for the fastest non-stop two way crossing of the Atlantic Ocean within a given time period. It was inaugurated in 1992 by [[New York Yacht Club]] in concert with [[Costa Smeralda Yacht Club]] of [[Sardinia]],

==Trophy==
The Columbus Atlantic Trophy is a two-foot silver goblet, which was actually given in 1928 to the NYYC by [[King Alfonso XIII of Spain]], as the prize for the 1928 trans-Atlantic yacht race won by NYYC's yacht ''Elena''.
The trophy is available to any vessel that can set a trans-Atlantic record one way, then (within a set time-frame) set the corresponding record back. A further stipulation is that the vessel must travel without stopping, and without re-fuelling en route.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/01/sports/boating-a-race-against-time-and-atlantic-s-waters.html A Race against Time and Atlantic waters] Barbara Lloyd, 1 June 1992 [[New York Times]]; retrieved 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of its inauguration the non-stop east-west record was that set by the American liner ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in July 1952, on her return to the US, crossing in 84 hours 12 minutes at an average speed of 34.51 [[knot (unit)|knots]]. The west- east record was that of the [[SeaCat]] ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'' in 1990, crossing in 79 hours 55 minutes at an average of 36.96 knots (and beating ''United States'' easterly voyage by 2hr 45 min, adding 1.37knots to the average speed).

In 1992 ''[[Destriero]]'' broke both records, crossing east to west (though by a different route, from [[Tarifa, Spain]] to New York) and two weeks later returning at an average speed of 53.09 knots.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; This also beat the unqualified trans-Atlantic record set by ''Gentry Eagle'' in 1989, which crossed west to east in 62 hour 7 minutes, at an average speed of 47.4 knots. 

This record has not so far been broken.

'''Computer aided call handling''' is a methodology for managing calls to service providers, such as emergency services, through the use of computer based algorithms in order to make consistent and objective decisions on action to be taken.  The computer software can provide scripting, prompts or interactive questioning to assist the call handler in gathering information.

The algorithms in the software will depend on the requirements of the service provider, the resources they have available, and the information that may be useful to resources dispatched or assigned to the call.  The output is likely to be a prioritised list of tasks for action, where the action could be passing to another remote service (such as a telephony centre), dispatching a physical resource (such as an [[ambulance]], [[police car]] or recovery truck) or closing the call without action.  The advantage in using a computer based system is objectivity in decisions made, meaning a consistent service delivery.

Call handling software can be linked to [[computer aided dispatch]] in order that this process is fully integrated, and information from the call handling software is passed directly to dispatch software where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7646858.html Protocol builder for a call handling system]&lt;/ref&gt;  This could also mean dispatching services which are not part of the organisation using the call handling software, such as an ambulance control centre automatically dispatching police to a violent incident, without the requirement to involve a further operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerphone.com/dev/news/pdf/PowerPhone_ENP_CACH_Article.pdf Computer-Aided Call Handling: Improving Technology at the Front End of Dispatch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111233/http://www.powerphone.com/dev/news/pdf/PowerPhone_ENP_CACH_Article.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allina was born in [[Prague]], in what was then the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]], and raised in [[Vienna]], in what was then the [[First Austrian Republic]]. As a child, he lived across the street from Sigmund Freud and he and his friends would peer through the window watching the renowned doctor smoke a cigar while listening to his patients. However, Allina never believed in psychoanalysis.

A [[Sephardic Jew]], he was imprisoned in various [[Nazi concentration camps]], between the ages of 19-23. He was the sole survivor of his immediate family. He told stories of having barely survived random executions. After an attempted escape from one camp, a selection of prisoners were lined up; every third one was to be shot. A guard miscounted, and Allina survived. After another group of prisoners were caught trying to escape, Allina, who had been sent on an errand, was counted among the escapees. He was the final prisoner to have the hangman's noose placed around his neck, but at the last second that prison guard vouched for him, saving him for his usefulness in speaking Czech, German and Russian. This was the theme of his life, his ability to survive.

In the post-war period, he emigrated to the [[United States]] and settled in [[New York City]]. He learned English by watching Tom Mix movies over and over again. After working his way through the slaughterhouses in New York during the 1940s, he eventually found himself working for Pez Candy, a subsidiary of Haas Foods, an Austrian-based company. At that time, Pez was successful in Europe, but going nowhere in the U.S. Allina went from an on-foot sales rep. to running Pez's North American operations for nearly 30 years. It wasn't until he had the idea of putting character heads on dispensers and filling them with child-friendly flavors that the company really took off. Allina is responsible for making Pez into the pop culture icon that it became. The first sculpted Pez dispensers (the candy had previously been distributed in tins and "regular" dispensers styled to resemble cigarette lighters) were introduced in 1955; Santa Claus and a Robot.

His travels took him to the square in Cuba the day Fidel Castro marched in, and was present in Argentina listening amongst the crowds to Eva Perón's final speech. Later in his life, he participated in and was filmed for Steven Spielberg's Shoah project.

Allina opted to move to Washington State for the latter part of his life, saying he felt a calling to go there. Perhaps it reminded him of the countryside in Vienna where he spent his childhood.

Allina died at 87 in December, 2009. He lived in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington.

'''''Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''''' (2001) is a book by investigative journalist [[Eric Schlosser]] that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry.

First serialized by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/fast-food-nation-part-one-the-true-cost-of-americas-diet-19980903|title=Fast-Food Nation Part One: The True Cost of America's Diet|last=Scholsser|first=Eric|publisher=Rolling Stone|year=1998|isbn=|location=Rolling Stone|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to [[Upton Sinclair]]'s classic [[muckraking]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jungle|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|publisher=Doubleday, Jabber, &amp; Company|year=1906|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a 2006 [[Fast Food Nation (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Richard Linklater]].

== About the Author ==
An investigative journalist with a degree in history from Princeton, [[Eric Schlosser]] explores subjects ignored by the mainstream media and tries to give a voice to people at the margins of society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barclayagency.com/site/speaker/eric-schlosser|title=Eric Schlosser {{!}} Steven Barclay Agency|website=www.barclayagency.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/14/food/fo-37251|title=The Hamburger Critic (and His Own Critics)|last=SAGON|first=CANDY|date=March 14, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the harvest with migrant farm workers in California, spent time with meatpacking workers in Texas and Colorado, told the stories of marijuana growers and pornographers and the victims of violent crime, gone on duty with the New York Police Department Bomb Squad, and visited prisons throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His aim is to shed light on worlds that are too often hidden.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has contributed to many journals including ''The New Yorker'' and ''The New York Times''. ''Fast Food Nation'' was his first book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
''Rolling Stone'' asked Schlosser to write an article looking at America through fast food in 1997 after reading his article on migrants in ''Atlantic Monthly''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/523/schlosser-food-finances.html|title=Q &amp; A: Eric Schlosser, author of 'Fast Food Nation,' on the state of the American food system|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The experience enraged and appalled him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Summary==
The book is divided into two sections: "The American Way" and "Meat and Potatoes". "The American Way"  takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while "Meat and Potatoes" examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.

=== "The American Way" ===
The first section of ''Fast Food Nation'' opens with a discussion of [[Carl N. Karcher]] and the [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|McDonald brothers]], examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of [[Ray Kroc]] and [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Ray Kroc#Purchasing McDonald's|complicated relationship]] before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits [[Colorado Springs, CO]] and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/17/where-near-minimum-wage-workers-work-and-how-much-they-make/|title=Where near-minimum-wage workers work, and how much they make|date=November 17, 2014|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Meat and Potatoes" ===
The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser's critique is particularly strong when analyzing the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/01/how-to-make-the-countrys-most-dangerous-job-safer/302395/|title=How to Make the Country's Most Dangerous Job Safer|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly more hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for [[E coli]] to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180312150520.htm|title=Water troughs are key to E. coli contamination in cattle|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/|title=Overweight and obesity|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/|title=Obesity and overweight|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Afterword"===
In the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at ''The Daily Beast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/12/still-a-fast-food-nation-eric-schlosser-reflects-on-10-years-later|title=Still a Fast Food Nation: Eric Schlosser Reflects on 10 Years Later|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|date=March 12, 2012|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young reader version==
An adaptation of ''Fast Food Nation'' for younger readers titled ''[[Chew on This]]'' was published in May 2006 by [[Houghton Mifflin]]. It is co-authored by journalist Charles Wilson

==Reception==

Rob Walker, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', remarks that "Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter"" and that "''Fast Food Nation'' isn't an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Rob|title=No Accounting for Mouthfeel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/21/reviews/010121.21walkert.html|accessdate=February 22, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker however does raise concerns over the data which Schlosser bases his claims from.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, Schlosser cites that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food, however, as Walker points out, "[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn't address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''The Atlantic's'' Julia Livshin believes "Schlosser's book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry's astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation's health, environment, economy, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/interviews/ba2000-12-14.htm|title=Interview - 2000.12.14|website=www.theatlantic.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government's efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair's similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry's various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-395-97789-7|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser, Author  Houghton Mifflin Co $26 (288p) ISBN 978-0-395-97789-7|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industry response ===

Terrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country's major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: "It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser's book, 'Fast Food Nation,' categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"[Schlosser] is trying to paint a picture of 1906 in order to scare people. Unfortunately, fear and graphic stories sell," said Janet Riley, vice president of public affairs for the American Meat Institute, the trade association that represents most of the nation's meat packers and processors. "There is no doubt in our minds that our food today is safer than it's ever been because there is so much more science and technology in our plants to ensure that safety. Our families eat from the same food supply that everyone else does. Of course we want safe food."

Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only "snippets" of Schlosser's book but calls it "well-intentioned criticism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Georgi Andreev Iliev''' ({{lang-bg|Георги Андреев Илиев}}) (July 22, 1966 – August 25, 2005) was a [[Bulgaria]]n businessman, best known for his ownership of a top Bulgarian [[football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Lokomotiv Plovdiv]].
In his early years he won several wrestling competitions and a few gold medals, but had to stop his sports career because of a criminal conviction due to his involvement in a group rape. Upon his release from prison he became something of a small-time criminal. After the death of his brother [[Vasil Iliev]] he became the boss of a criminal organization called [[VIS (criminal organisation)|VIS]], which fronted as a legitimate security and insurance provider. The former head secretary of the Bulgarian Ministry of Internal Affairs [[Boyko Borisov]] claims to information showing Georgi Iliev's involvement in [[drug dealing]] and [[smuggling]] operations. According to Grigor Lilov, author of "The Richest Bulgarians", Georgi Iliiev had amassed a fortune of over $250 million.

He is also thought to have taken an eighteen-year-old [[Dimitar Berbatov]] hostage with plans of making him sign for his football team. Berbatov's father contacted [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]'s boss [[Iliya Pavlov]] who set things straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Бербатов призна: Георги Илиев ме отвлече |url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=243597 |work=24 chasa |publisher=Вестникарска група България ООД |date=3 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125125559/http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=243597 |archivedate=2009-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death==

He was shot and killed at a restaurant in [[Sunny Beach]], a resort town on Bulgaria's [[Black Sea]] coast near the city of [[Bourgas]], by a suspected [[sniper]].  Iliev was alleged to be an [[organized crime]] boss, and so his murder was suspected to be part of an ongoing turf war between rival criminal gangs. His brother [[Vasil Iliev]] was also shot and killed in 1995 in [[Sofia]].

*'''1994:''' Arthur "Buzz" Schmidt founded Philanthropic Research, Inc. in Williamsburg, Virginia as a company dedicated to helping donors make better giving decisions by providing easily accessibly nonprofit information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=April|title=COLLECTION OF DATA CALLED A BLESSING FOR CHARITIES|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/dailypress/access/709688081.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+8%2C+2004&amp;author=APRIL+TAYLOR+Daily+Press&amp;pub=Daily+Press&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.10&amp;desc|work=Daily Press|date=October 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''1996:''' Philanthropic Research, Inc. officially received [[Tax-exempt status|tax-exempt]] status as a [[501(c)]](3) public charity, and in July, published the GuideStar Directory of American Charities, a CD and printed index that presented full reports on 35,000 charities and partial reports on 7,000 other charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayfield|first=Dave|title=ONLINE INFORMATION ON CHARITIES "THERE'S HUGE CHARITABLE CAPACITY THAT'S UNTAPPED.

The establishment of the '''Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency''' (IBRA) ({{lang-id|'''Badan Penyehatan Perbankan Nasional'''}} (BPPN)) in early 1998 was one of a series of steps taken by the [[Indonesian government]], in agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] on 15 January 1998, in response to the banking and economic crisis which emerged following the onset of the [[Asian monetary crisis]] in mid-1997.&lt;ref&gt;IMF, [https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/1998/nb9802.htm Statement by the Managing Director on the IMF Program with Indonesia'], 15 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the drastic depreciation of the [[rupiah]] (Rp) reduced bank [[liquidity]], and loss of public confidence in the rupiah and the banking system in general.

In establishing IBRA, the Indonesian authorities were effectively establishing a "[[Bad bank#Indonesia (1998)|bad bank]]" financial vehicle to allow the segregation of bad debts away from established banks with the aim of promoting the overall recovery of Indonesia's financial system.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the process of bank restructuring following the Asian financial crisis in Indonesia are in Yuri Sato, '[http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/pdf/05_01_05.pdf Bank Restructuring and Financial Institution Reform in Indonesia'], ''The Developing Economies'', XLVIII(1), March 2005, pp. 91-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a measure to cope with the scarcity of liquidity in the nation's banking system, in late 1997 and early 1998 the central bank ([[Bank Indonesia]]), as a lender of the last resort, provided liquidity assistance loans to banks. In addition, the Government instituted a blanket guarantee program for all bank liabilities, to arrest further erosion of confidence towards the system. This process left the Indonesian banking system holding a large number of bad loans at the end of 1997.

==History==

===Establishment===

IBRA was established on 26 January 1998 (based on the Presidential Decree No 27 year 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dprd.jatimprov.go.id/produkhukum/0ca49-KEPRES_27_1998.pdf Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 27 Tahun 1998] (Presidential Decree No 27 of 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and was planned to have lifespan of five years in order to undertake its tasks. In the event, IBRA’s liquidation took longer than planned and the Agency was finally terminated on 30 April 2004. According to the decree establishing IBRA (Presidential Decree No. 27 Year 1998), IBRA's objectives were to administer the government's blanket guarantee program, and to supervise, manage and restructure distress banks. These objectives were extended on 27 February 1999 to include managing the government’s assets in performing banks under restructuring status and to optimise the recovery rate of asset disposals of distressed banks. IBRA undertook a comprehensive series of activities consisting of bank liability program, bank restructuring, bank loan restructuring, shareholders settlement, and the recovery of state funds. These were carried out by the major operating units within IBRA (Bank Restructuring, Asset Management Credit, Asset Management Investment, Risk Management, and Support and Administration).

IBRA was supervised by the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Sector Policy Committee (FSPC) and the Oversight Committee. A Financial Sector Policy Committee (FSPC/Komite Kebijakan Sektor Keuangan) was formed on 21 August 1998 whose members included the main economic ministers of Indonesia, and the Independent Review Committee (IRC), which includes representatives from [[International Monetary Fund]]s (IMF), the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB).

===Controversy===
During the period of the existence of the Agency, IBRA had a troubled record.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Arnold, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/02/business/indonesian-bank-agency-fading-out.html?pagewanted=all Indonesian Bank Agency Fading Our'], ''International New York Times'', 2 October 2003, and Reiner S., '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/12/27/ibra-disappoints-ahead-early-closure-next-year.html IBRA disappoints ahead of early closure next year'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 27 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency was criticised for being slow in implementing its tasks of restructuring, for lack of transparency, and for alleged irregulatories.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/11/23/ibra-be-audited-soon-says-bambang.html IBRA to be audited soon, says Bambang'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also considerable controversy surrounding its operations, including the salaries of senior staff which were said to be very high.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/01/30/ibra-bashing.html IBRA bashing'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===

One main problem for the Agency was that, partly because of period of political instability that Indonesia passed through after the fall of [[Suharto|President Suharto]] in May 1998, there were numerous changes in leadership (of the ''Ketua'' or the Chair) of IBRA.  During the six years of IBRA's operations, there were a total of seven heads of the Agency.

===Closure===
When the Agency was finally closed at the end of April 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esdm.go.id/prokum/keppres/2004/keppres-15-2004.pdf Presidential Decree No 15 of 2004] formally closing the Agency was signed on 27 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the head of Indonesia's Supreme Audit Agency, [[Satrio Budihardjo Joedono|Billy Joedono]] was cautious about reaching conclusions about the performance of IBRA. Before submitting a report to the Indonesian Parliament, Billy Joedono noted that IBRA appeared to have done its job in restructuring the majority of troubled banks but nevertheless left further conclusions about the performance of IBRA to the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Hotland, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/05/08/ibra-did-job-success-unclear-says-audit-agency.html IBRA did job, but success unclear, says audit agency'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 8 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;'

It came into force in 1993. The Act provides [[exclusive right]]s for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.

Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or '''IC products''' that are configured and interconnected. These creations are protected in Canada by the Integrated Circuit Topography Act, which gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of ten years after registration. Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.

==Early life and education==
Karna Shakya was born April 2, 1941{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Shakya holds AIFC postgraduate in Forestry from the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]], Dehradun, India in 1967.&lt;ref name=rirt&gt;{{cite book |title=Readings in Rural Tourism 1st Edition |editor=Rudra Prasad Updahyay |publisher=Sunlight Publication |year=2008 |isbn=9789937804479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hotel entrepreneur"&gt;Surath Giri.

==Conservation==
Shakya served as a wildlife conservation officer in Nepal. While working in the department of forest, he traveled to remote areas such as Dolpo, Mustang, Manang, Jomsom, Humla and Jumla in the Northern regions of Nepal.&lt;ref name=dolpo&gt;Karna Shakya. ''Dolpo''&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the [[pygmy hog]], the smallest wild boar, in the jungle of Assam and Sundar Kundar forest in East Nepal.&lt;ref name=dolpo/&gt; Based on his travels and research, he wrote two books, ''Dolpo'' and ''Look Down Not Up''. He collected many folktales during his travel and published a book named ''Tales of Kathmandu'' with Dr. Linda Griffith. In 1970, after he resigned from forestry, he entered the tourism business. In 1982, he submitted a proposal for the [[Annapurna Conservation Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/women_and_development_in_the_third_world.pdf |title=Women and Development in the Third World |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |author=Manaslu Gurung |year=2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124174551/http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/women_and_development_in_the_third_world.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2013 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}} Quote: "The first proposal to establish a protected area in the Annapurna region was, however, presented by Karna Sakya.."&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in bringing conservation awareness in the country by establishing Nepal nature conservation society, the first conservation oriented NGO in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Soch_karnaSakya archive]. SOCH _Karna Sakya.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has attended many international workshops, colloquiums, and conferences and presented papers and speeches on heritage conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiGQdfkLFbs|title=Sampreshan Ep11 Karna Shakya-Part 2|access-date=2018-08-04|time={{time needed|date=August 2018}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiHKnWdECUU|title=Sampreshan Ep11 Karna Shakya-Part 1|access-date=2018-08-04|time={{time needed|date=August 2018}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="electronic medias"&gt;[http://videochautari.com/videos/528/karna-shakya-on-mero-jindagi-mero-biswas "Mero-Jindagi-Mero-Biswas with Karna Shakya - Writer and Tourism Businessman"]. Karna Shakya on Mero Jindagi Mero Biswas. Broadcast by NTV on 2010-2-5, Presented by Bijay Kumar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
After he resigned from the Forestry Department, helped his brother Basanta Bahadur Sakya open a 13-room Kathmandu Guest House in Thamel , which was very successful.&lt;ref name=avital/&gt;&lt;ref name=ntt/&gt; Now he runs a chain of environment friendly hotels and resorts in different parts of Nepal.&lt;ref name=avital/&gt; He has been credited as a pioneer who opened Thamel as a world tourist destination.&lt;ref name=rirt/&gt; Many renowned writers, actors, musicians, researchers and artists come and stay there.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} His company KGH Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://ktmgh.com/ KGH Group], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; operates Kathmandu Guest House in Thamel, Park Village in Budhanilkhantha,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktmgh.com/park-village-hotels-resorts.html Kathmandu Guest House, Park Village].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakya is known as a father of tourism in Nepal.&lt;ref name=avital /&gt; In 1998, he started the first ever tourism project "Visit Nepal Year 1998" which helped to bring awareness about the country.&lt;ref name=ntt/&gt; This was followed by Sports Himalaya Year 2000.&lt;ref name=rirt/&gt;

==Social work==
In 1987, Shakya lost his wife and daughter from cancer.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} At the time, there were no cancer treatment facilities in Nepal and if someone got cancer they had to go abroad for treatment. After he went through a very painful ordeal, he single-handedly started a national campaign to bring awareness on cancer prevention.&lt;ref name="prevention"&gt;[http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2007/08/id/1789 mysansar]. Exclusive: कर्ण शाक्यको सोच डाउनलोड गर्नुस्&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in establishing the first cancer hospital in Bharatpur, Nepal.&lt;ref name=avital/&gt; He mobilized public opinion so that a national tax on cigarettes, of one paise, was raised to pay for it.&lt;ref name=ntt/&gt; He was President of the [[Nepal Cancer Relief Society]] and served as an adviser on its Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=ncrs&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131122165821/http://www.ncrs.org.np/?comp=com_contents&amp;task=details&amp;id=227&amp;title=our-past-presidents Past Presidents] &amp; [https://web.archive.org/web/20131122170202/http://www.ncrs.org.np/?comp=com_contents&amp;task=details&amp;id=226&amp;title=board-of-directors Board of Directors], Nepal Cancer Relief Society.&lt;/ref&gt; He was member of [[B.P. Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Writer==
As an environmentalist, he has written four books in English. In 2000, when the Maoist movement was escalating, many entrepreneurs and businessmen left the country and migrated abroad due to anxiety and skepticism, but Shakya decided to live in Nepal and invest in tourism. When the political situation deteriorated, he was caught in a dilemma, whether to continue his hotel business or close it. Contrarily, despite adverse situations, he built three more hotels.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} During that period, he wrote his first book, ''Soch'' (''A Thought''). After ''Soch'', he wrote a series of books namely, ''Khoj'' (''Search''), ''Ma Sakchu'' (''I Can Do''), and ''Moj'' (''Pleasure and Satisfaction'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/09/28/onsaturday/more-than-survival/240181.html "More than survival"], ''[[The Kathmandu Post]]'', September 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Shakya is a role model among some Nepalese youths.&lt;ref name="youths"&gt;Anand Gurung. [http://www.hotelnepal.com/news.php?id=961 "Heroism of a Hotelier"]. Quote: He is a ‘walking inspiration’ to people privileged to be around him.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his books, he inspired many migrant youths to return to Nepal and start their own enterprises.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He also wrote the screenplay for a Nepali feature film ''Pal'' (''Moments of Life'', 2011), which he also produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/05/17/et-cetera/a-breath-of-fresh-air/221822.html The Kathmandu Post]. Quote: "The film's script has been penned by Karna Shakya, a well-known writer"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=56102&amp;cat_id=10 The Rising Nepal]. Quote: "the movie has been developed by noted writer and entrepreneur Karna Shakya"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pal'' tells the story in two different perspectives before and after interval.{{clarify|reason=Before and after interval?|date=November 2013}} It won the Chalchitra Bikash Parishad award in 2012.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Based on global warming and climate change, he wrote a script for a futuristic movie in August 2009, ''New York Water City'' (NYWC).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34123">{{for|the documentary|Miss Representation}}
A concept of [[English law]], a '''misrepresentation'''  is an untrue or misleading&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]'' [1931]&lt;/ref&gt;  statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, the statement  then inducing that other party into the contract.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]''[1951] Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it merely covered risk to the beads, but in fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained but the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation, and the claim was allowed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]'' [1951] 1 KB 805&lt;/ref&gt; The misled party may normally [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).

The law of misrepresentation is an amalgam of contract and tort; and its sources are [[common law]], [[Equity (law)|equity]] and [[statute]]. The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. The general principle of misrepresentation has been adopted by the USA and various Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Misrepresentation in India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation and contract terms==
A "representation" is a pre-contractual statement made during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;For the purposes of "offer and acceptance", a representation may serve a further function such as an "offer", "counter-offer", "invitation to treat", "request for information" or "statement of intention"&lt;/ref&gt; If a representation has been incorporated into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]],&lt;ref&gt;A contractual term may be a [[warranty]], [[Contractual term#Condition or Warranty|condition]] or innominate term.&lt;/ref&gt; then the normal remedies for [[breach of contract]] apply. Factors that determine whether or not a representation has become a term include:
* The relative expertise of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oscar Chess v Williams (1957) ]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dick Bentley v Harold Smith Motors ]]'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reliance that one party has shown on the statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bannerman v White]]'' (1861).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The reassurances given by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schawel v Reade]]'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary norms of the trade in question.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ecay v Godfrey]]'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The representation forms the basis of a [[collateral contract]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andrews v Hopkinson]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shanklin Pier v Detel Products]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evans v Andrea Merzario]]'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co. v Buckleton]]'' [1913] A.C. 30 HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' [1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1919|ltigants=Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer |parallecite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.pdf (1919) 27 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 133 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, an action may lie in misrepresentation, and perhaps in the torts of [[negligence]] and [[deceit]] also.  Although a suit for breach of contract is relatively straightforward, there are advantages in bringing a parallel suit in misrepresentation, because whereas repudiation is available only for breach of condition&lt;ref&gt;A "condition" is a term whose breach denies the main benefit of the contract to the claimant.&lt;/ref&gt; only, rescission is ''[[prima facie]]'' available for all misreps, subject to the provisions of s.2 of the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]], and subject to the inherent limitations of an equitable remedy.&lt;ref&gt;"Inherent limitations": equitable remedies are only ever discretionary; and one must "come to equity with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt;

== No general duty of disclosure==
There is no general duty of disclosure in English contract law, and one is normally not obliged to say anything.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[EU Law]] has introduced a "right of reasonable expectation". - ''[[Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA|Marleasing]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary contracts do not require "good faith" as such,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/92d74f21-c4e3-4d1d-86ac-77fa21b6c95c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/65ac405d-db68-4d53-bdfa-8434e78cf627/Good_Faith_jul2013_corp-alert.pdf "Good faith in English contract law?"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mere compliance with the law is sufficient. However in particular relationships silence may form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants= [[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 at [68]|courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Davies v. London &amp; Provincial Marine Insurance Co]]'' (1878) 8 Ch. D. 469, 474. Justice Fry commented on the responsibilities of a fiduciary "...they can only contract after the most ample disclosure of everything..."&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Agency (law)|Agents]] have a [[fiduciary|fiduciary relationship]] with their principal. They must make proper disclosure and must not make secret profits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lowther v Lord Lowther]]'' (1806) 13 Ves Jr 95, the plaintiff handed over a picture to an agent for sale. The agent knew of the picture's true worth yet bought it for a considerably lower price. The plaintiff subsequently discovered the picture's true worth and sued to rescind the contract. It was held that the defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and accordingly assumed an obligation to disclose all material facts. Accordingly, the contract could be rescinded.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employers and employees have a ''[[Ex fida bona|bona fide]]'' duty to each other once a [[contract of employment]] has begun; but a job applicant owes no duty of disclosure in a job interview.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Fletcher v Krell'' (1873) 2 LJ (QB) 55, a woman who was appointed to the post of governess failed to reveal that she had previously been married. (The employer favoured single women).  It was held that she had made no misrepresentation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spice Girls v Aprilia World Service'' CHD 24 FEB 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swarb.co.uk/spice-girls-ltd-v-aprilia-world-service-bv-chd-24-feb-2000/&lt;/ref&gt;
* A contract ''[[uberrima fides|uberrimae fidei]]'' is a contract of 'utmost good faith', and include contracts of insurance, business partnerships, and family agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gordon v Gordon]]'' (1821) 3 Swan 400, two brothers had reached an agreement regarding the family estate. The elder brother was under the impression that he was born out of wedlock and thus not their father's true heir. The agreement was reached on this basis. The elder brother subsequently discovered that this was not the case and that the younger brother had knowledge of this during the negotiation of the settlement. The elder brother sued to set aside the agreement and was successful on the grounds that such a contract was one of uberrimae fidei and the required disclosure had not been executed.&lt;/ref&gt; When applying for insurance, the proposer must disclose all material facts for the insurer properly to assess the risk.&lt;ref&gt;In insurance the insurer agrees to indemnify the assured against losses proximately caused by insured perils, and the insurer is thus entitled to know full details of the risk being transferred to him.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Blackburn addressed the issue in ''[[Brownlie v Campbell]]'' (1880) 5 App Cas 925 when he noted "...the concealment of a material circumstance known to you...avoids the policy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1908 case of ''[[Joel v Law Union]]''  [1908] KB 884 the ''de minimis'' rule was applied in a life assurance  policy. Despite minor omissions, the assured had made a sufficiently substantial disclosure of material facts that the insurer knew the risk, and the policy was valid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''lex non curat de minimis''  - the law does not concern itself with trifles&lt;/ref&gt; The duty of disclosure in insurance has been substantially amended by the [[Insurance Act 2015]].

==The "untrue statement"==
{{Clist misrepresentation}}
To amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A statement which is "technically true" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an "untrue statement".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd]]'', Krakowski agreed to enter into a contract to buy a shop premises from Eurolynx as long as a 'strong tenant' had been organised. The contract proceeded on the grounds that such a tenant had been arranged. Unbeknown to Krakowski, Eurolynx had entered into an additional agreement with the tenant to provide funds for the first three months rent to ensure the contract went ahead. When the tenant defaulted on the rent and subsequently vacated the premises, Krakowski found out about the additional agreement and rescinded the contract with Eurolynx. It was held that Eurolynx's failure to disclose all material facts about the 'strong tenant' was enough to constitute a misrepresentation and the contract could be rescinded on these grounds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"/&gt; If a misstatement is made and later the representor finds that it is false, it becomes fraudulent unless the representer updates the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Lockhart v. Osman'' [1981] VR 57, an agent had advertised some cattle as being “well-suited for breeding purposes”. Later on, it was discovered that the stock had been exposed to a contagious disease which affected the reproductive system. It was held that the agent had a duty to take remedial action and correct the representation. The failure by the agent to take such measures resulted in the contract being set aside.&lt;/ref&gt; If the statement is true at the time, but becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the representor must update the original statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, the plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase O’Flanagan’s medical practice. During negotiations it was said that the practice produced an income of £2000 per year. Before the contract was signed, the practice took a downward turn and lost a significant amount of value. After the contract had been entered into, the true nature of the practice was discovered and the plaintiff took action in misrepresentation. In his decision, Lord Wright said, "...a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; Actionable misrepresentations must be misstatements of fact or law:&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349, abolished a bar on mistake of law bar and Pankhania v Hackney LBC [2002] EWHC 2441 (Ch) held the same went for misrepresentation under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) where agents of a land seller incorrectly said that people running a car park on some property were licensees rather than protected business tenants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|19|1928|litigants=Fitzpatrick v Michel |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; misstatements of opinion&lt;ref&gt;''Bisset v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177 PC&lt;/ref&gt; or intention are not deemed statements of fact;&lt;ref name="Opinion and intention"&gt;See ''[[Achut v Achuthan]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|68|1995|litigants=Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd |parallelcite=(1995) 183  [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but if one party appears to have specialist knowledge of the topic, his  "opinions" may be considered actionable misstatements of fact.&lt;ref name="Opinion as fact"&gt;See ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Land &amp; House Property '' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt; For example, false statements made by a seller regarding the quality or nature of the property that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property]]'' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of opinion'''
Statements of opinion are usually insufficient to amount to a misrepresentation&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; as it would be unreasonable to treat personal opinions as "facts", as in ''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions can arise where opinions may be treated as "facts":
* where an opinion is expressed yet this opinion is not actually held by the representor,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt;
* where it is implied that the representor has facts on which to base the opinion,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property Corp]]'' (1884) 28 Ch. D. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* where one party should have known facts on which such an opinion would be based.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Esso Petroleum v Mardon]]'' [1976] QB 801.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Statements of intention'''
Statements of intention do not constitute misrepresentations should they fail to come to fruition, since the time the statements were made they can not be deemed either true or false. However,  an action can be brought if the intention never actually existed, as in ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]'' (1885) 29 Ch. D. 459, company directors seeking a loan "intended to develop the business" always intended to use the cash to repay debts. The state of mind is an existing fact, therefore, a false presentation of an existing fact, so that the contract was voidable.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of law'''
For many years, statements of law were deemed incapable of amounting to misrepresentations because the law is "equally accessible by both parties" and is "...as much the business of the plaintiff as of [the defendants] to know what the law [is].".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beattie v Lord Ebury]]'' (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777, 803.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has changed, and it is now accepted that statements of law may be treated as akin to statements of fact.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Cite AustLII|HCA|48|1992|litigants=[[David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{Cite AustLII|VicRp|31|1978|litigants=Public Trustee v Taylor |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}. While dealing with a mistake of law, similar reasoning should apply to a misrepresentation of law.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Lord Denning "...the distinction between law and fact is illusory".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andre &amp; Cie v Ets Michel Blanc &amp; Fils]]'' [1979] 2 Lloyds LR 427, 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statement to the misled'''
An action in misrepresentation can only be brought by the misled party, or "represent". This means that only those who were an intended recipient of the representation may sue, as in ''[[Peek v Gurney]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peek v Gurney]]'' (1873) LR 6 HL 377, where the plaintiff sued the directors of a company for indemnity. The action failed because it was found that the plaintiff was not a represent (an intended party to the representation) and accordingly misrepresentation could not be a protection.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary for the representation to have been be received directly; it is sufficient that the representation was made to another party with the intention that it would become known to a subsequent party and ultimately acted upon by them.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1972|litigants=[[Commercial Banking Co (Sydney) Ltd v R H Brown &amp; Co]] |parallelcite=(1972) 126 [[Commonwelath Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it IS essential that the untruth originates from the defendant.

===Inducement===
The misled party must show that he relied on the misstatement and was induced into the contract by it.

In ''[[Attwood v Small]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1838) 6 Cl&amp;F 232&lt;/ref&gt; The seller, Small, made false claims about the capabilities of his mines and steelworks. The buyer, Attwood, said he would verify the claims before he bought, and he employed agents who declared that Small's claims were true. The House of Lords held that Attwood could not rescind the contract, as he did not rely on Small but instead relied on his agents. ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''&lt;ref name="1885 29 Ch D 459"&gt;(1885) 29 Ch D 459&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.&lt;ref&gt;A Burrows, ''A Casebook on Contract'' (Hart, Oxford 2007) 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No 2)]]'' [2002] UKHL 43, damages for deceit cannot be reduced for contributory negligence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd]]'' [1992] QB 560&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' (1871) LR 6 QB 597&lt;/ref&gt;

A party induced by a misrepresentation is not obliged to check its veracity. In ''[[Redgrave v Hurd]]'' &lt;ref&gt;(1881) 20 Ch D 1&lt;/ref&gt; Redgrave, an elderly solicitor told Hurd, a potential buyer, that the practice earned £300 pa. Redgrave said  Hurd could inspect the accounts to check the claim, but Hurd did not do so. Later, having signed a contract to join Redgrave as a partner, Hurd discovered the practice generated only £200 pa, and the accounts verified this figure. [[Lord Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolles|MR]] held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Redgrave had made a misrepresentation, adding that Hurd was entitled to rely on the £300 statement.&lt;ref&gt;The case also makes clear that, the circumstances having altered, Redgrave was under a duty to inform the Hurd of the changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Leaf v International Galleries'' [1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt; where a gallery sold painting after wrongly saying it was a [[John Constable|Constable]], [[Lord Denning]] held that while there was neither breach of contract nor operative mistake, there WAS a misrepresentation; but, five years having passed, the buyer's right to rescind had lapsed. This suggests that, having relied on a misrepresentation, the misled party has the onus to discover the truth "within a reasonable time". In ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]''1969 2 QB 158 CA&lt;/ref&gt; a party misled by a fraudulent misrepresentation was deemed NOT to have affirmed even after more than a year.

==Fraudulent, negligent and innocent misrepresentation==
[[File:Misrep chart.jpg|thumb|A chart of the 3 types of misrepresentation, with definitions &amp; remedies]]
The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. (Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as a confusing and poorly drafted statute which has caused a number of difficulties, especially in relation to the basis of the award of damages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]'' [1991] 2 QB 297&lt;/ref&gt; It was mildly amended by the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]).

Prior to the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and "wholly" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories.&lt;ref&gt;Nowhere in the 1967 Act are the words "negligent misrepresentation" to be found; that terminology was established by practising and academic lawyers.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of the three categories is that the law recognises that the defendant may have been blameworthy to a greater or lesser extent; and the relative degrees of blameworthiness lead to differing remedies for the claimant.

Once misrepresentation has been proven, it is presumed to be "negligent misrepresentation", the default category.  It then falls to the claimant to prove that the defendant's culpability was more serious and that the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Conversely, the defendant may try to show that his misrepresentation was innocent.

* '''Negligent misrepresentation''' is simply the '''default category'''.&lt;ref&gt;There is no specific relationship between negligent misrepresentation and the tort of negligence and the duty of care under ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' or ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''Remedy: '''The misled party may rescind and claim damages under s.2(1) for any losses. The court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission, but s.2(3) prevents the award of double damages.

* '''Fraudulent misrepresentation''' is defined is the 3-part test in ''[[Derry v Peek]]'', where the defendant is fraudulent if he:
:(i) knows the statement to be false,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or 
:(ii) does not believe in the statement,&lt;ref&gt;A defendant honestly believing his statement to be true is not fraudulent: "Honesty of belief in the truth of a warranty is no defence to a breach of warranty, whereas it is a complete defence to a charge of false representation. If a statement is an honest expression of opinion, honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; or 
:(iii) is [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to its truth.

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind and claim damages for all directly consequential losses. ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969]

* '''Innocent misrepresentation''' is "belief on reasonable grounds up till the time of the contract that the facts represented are true". (s.2(1)of the Act).

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind but has no entitlement to damages under s.2(1). However, the court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission.&lt;ref&gt;The victim of an innocent misrepresentation who wishes to affirm the contract has no legal right to damages. Of course, the misled party may seek to negotiate a compensation payment, but the other party need not comply; and if the misled party litigates to seek "damages in lieu", but the court holds that the contract must subsist, the misled party will lose the case and be liable for costs.&lt;/ref&gt; (By contrast, the victim of a breach of warranty in contract may claim damages for loss, but may not repudiate)&lt;ref&gt;[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd|''Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent misstatement==
'''Negligent misstatement''' is not strictly part of the law of misrepresentation, but is a [[tort]] based upon the 1964 ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' [1964] A.C. 465&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Judicial functions of the House of lords|House of Lords]] found that a negligently-made statement (if relied upon) could be actionable provided a "special relationship" existed between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Hedley Byrne v Heller'', the "special relationship" was between one bank who gave a financial reference to another bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently in ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] Q.B. 801&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lord Denning]] transported this tort into [[contract law]], stating the rule as:

''...if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another…with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable'.

==Remedies==
The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]).

===Rescission===
{{main|Rescission (contract law)}}
A contract vitiated by misrepresentation is [[voidable]] and not [[void (law)|void ''ab initio'']]. The misled party may either (i) rescind, or (ii) affirm and continue to be bound. If the claimant chooses to rescind, the contract will still be deemed to have been valid up to the time it was avoided, so any transactions with a third party remains valid, and the third party will retain [[legal title|good title]].&lt;ref name="shogun"&gt;For legal reasoning application of the difference see ''[[Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson]]'' [2004] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 919; Brooks, O &amp; Dodd, A ‘Shogun: A Principled Decision’ (2003) 153 ''NLJ'' 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission can be effected either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. Rescission is an equitable remedy which is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;"He who comes to equity must come with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission requires the parties to be restored to their former positions; so if this is not possible, rescission is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Impossibility"&gt;See ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App. Cas. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

A misled party who, knowing of the misrepresentation, fails to take steps to avoid the contract will be deemed to have '''affirmed''' through "[[Laches (equity)|laches]]", as in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' 1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Affirmation"&gt;See ''[[Long v. Lloyd]]'' [1958] 1 WLR 753. See also {{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1955|litigants=Alati v Kruger |paralleicte=(1955) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 216 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''Long v Lloyd''  Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‘exceptional condition,’ said to do 40 mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half the price of a reconstructed dynamo. Because Mr Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani,[42] actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have "affirmed" a contract.&lt;/ref&gt; and the claimant will be estopped from rescinding. The time limit for taking such steps varies depending on the type of misrepresentation. In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, the time limit runs until when the misrepresentation ought to have been discovered, whereas in innocent misrepresentation, the right to rescission may lapse even before the represent can reasonably be expected to know about it.&lt;ref name="Lapse"&gt;See ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' [1950] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, third party rights may intervene and render rescission impossible. Say, if A misleads B and contracts to sell a house to him, and B later sells to C, the courts are unlikely to permit rescission as that would unfair impinge upon C.

Under [[Misrepresentations Act 1967]] s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the [[court]] has discretion to award damages instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], "if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party."

===Damages===
{{main| Damages}}
"Damages" are monetary compensation for loss. In contract&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and tort,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; damages will be awarded if the breach of contract (or breach of duty) causes '''foreseeable''' loss.

* By contrast, a fraudulent misrepresentor is liable in the common law tort of [[deceit]] for all direct consequences, whether or not the losses were foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd]]'' [1969] 2 QB 158]&lt;/ref&gt;
*For negligent misrepresentation, the claimant may get damages as of right under s.2(1) and/or damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).
* For innocent misrepresentation, the claimant may get only damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).

Given the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non-fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best may honestly "believe on reasonable grounds" that he told the truth) for many years lawyers presumed that for these two categories, damages would be on a contract/tort basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss.

In 1991, ''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' [1991] 3 All ER 294 CA&lt;/ref&gt; changed all that. The court gave a [[statutory interpretation|literal interpretation]] of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides  that where a person has been misled by a negligent misrepresentation  then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, the defendant "shall be so liable"). The phrase '''shall be so liable''' was read literally to mean "liable as in fraudulent misrepresentation". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for negligent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, even if he has been merely careless.&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' is arguably ''[[Mechanisms of the English common law|per incuriam]]'' as the court failed to pay attention to the definition of fraudulent misrep in ''[[Derry v Peek]]''. Had the court done so, it would have held that the misrep in this case was fraudulent rather than negligent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] left the 1967 Act intact.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Tortious liability has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]] will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's [[reliance interest]], whereas damages for breach of contract protect the claimant's [[expectation interest]], although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;name="Opportunity"&gt;See ''[[East v Maurer]]'' [1991] 2 All ER 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

S.2 does not specify how "damages in lieu" should be determined, and interpretation of the statute is up to the courts.

==Vitiating factors==

{{main|Vitiating factors in the law of contract}}
Misrepresentation is one of several [[vitiating factor]]s that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:

* [[Undue influence]]
* [[Duress in English law]]
* [[Duress in American law]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9979">'''Moriz von Kuffner''' (January 30, 1854 – March 5, 1939) was a [[Jewish]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[industrialist]], [[art collector]], [[mountaineer]] and [[philanthropist]]. From the 1880s to the early 1910s he made a fortune in the [[brewery]] business, and became a significant sponsor of Vienna's social and cultural life as well as a mentor of astronomy. Moriz von Kuffner was forced to sell his Austrian assets and to leave Vienna in 1938.

==Industrialist and philanthropist==
Moriz was born in [[Ottakring]], [[Lower Austria]] (then a suburb of [[Vienna]], now a city district), the son of Ignaz Kuffner, member of a Jewish industrialist dynasty from [[Břeclav|Lundenburg]], who (together with his cousin Jacob) had taken over the [[Brauerei Ottakringer|brewery in Ottakring]] in 1850. Ignaz had been mayor of [[Ottakring]] from 1869 to 1876, and was elevated to minor Austrian nobility (''Edler von Kuffner'') in 1878.

[[Image:Kuffner Observatory - Helimoeter Dome.jpg|thumb|widthpx|The [[Kuffner observatory]]]]
[[Image:Palais Kufner Ottakringerstraße 118-120.JPG|thumb|widthpx|The Palais Kuffner]]

Moriz studied chemistry at the K.K. Polytechnisches Institut (the predecessor of the [[Technical University of Vienna]]). When his father died in 1882, Moriz upgraded and greatly extended the brewery he had inherited. In 1902 he transformed it into a joint stock company, with his cousins Wilhelm Kuffner and Karl Kuffner de Diószegh as partners. He was also president of the sugar refinery in [[Sládkovičovo|Diószeg]] in Western Slovakia and of the Steinbruck brewery in [[Budapest]]; was among the largest owners of real estate in Vienna; owned significant collections of art including many works by [[Albrecht Dürer]]; and was a founding member of the [[Musikverein]]. From 1900 to 1919 he was an executive director of the [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien]]. In addition, Moriz was an enthusiastic and highly reputed alpinist who scaled most of the alpine summits of 4,000 m height and above, establishing new routes on the [[Eiger]], [[Mont Blanc]], [[Mont Pelvoux]], [[Mont Maudit]] (on which the well-known Kuffner or Frontier ridge is named after him) and others.

On top of all this Moriz von Kuffner was so fascinated by astronomy that he sponsored the construction, equipment and operation of an observatory on some of his real estate on the slope of the [[Gallitzinberg]] where at the time of its construction (1884-1892) the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]] reached almost down into Ottakring. This [[Kuffner observatory]] is his most important surviving legacy. Kuffner named [[asteroids]] [[242 Kriemhild]] and [[243 Ida]], by courtesy of their discoverer [[Johann Palisa]].&lt;ref&gt;According to a remark in a [http://kuffner-sternwarte.at/2001/seinerzeit_spezial.html biography of Johann Palisa at the Kuffner Observatory website] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, in 1887, Moriz had a representative residence (the Palais Kuffner) built in Ottakring. It quickly became an attraction for Viennese society, culture, and politics.

World War I dealt a significant economic blow to the Kuffner family, and essentially ended the era of their sponsorship. Brewery product sales recovered only very slowly, and profits never returned to the levels seen during the "century of the brewers."

=== Mountaineering ===
During the 1880s and 1890s Moriz von Kuffner became one of the leading mountaineers in Austria. As a keen and recognised [[Alpinist]] he conquered most of the Alpine [[four-thousander]]s, blazing new routes, some of which were later named after him, like the Kuffer Ridge (''Kuffnergrat'') on Mont Maudit and the Kuffner Pillar (''Kuffnerpfeiler'') on the Piz Palü.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;see Katja Fischer: ''Jüdische Kunstsammlungen in Wien vor 1938 am Beispiel der Familie Kuffner''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/sup&gt;
He was accompanied on most of his expeditions by [[mountain guide]]s, [[Alexander Burgener]], J. M. Biner (also Biener), J. Furrer, A. Kalbermatten, Cl. Perren, Christian Ranggetiner, E. Rubesoir, J. P. Ruppen and Martin Schocher.&lt;ref name=Ferrari&gt;see Ferrari D'Occhieppo–Hösch: ''Kuffner Moritz von''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced emigration and death==
The year 1938 was disastrous for the 84-year-old Moriz von Kuffner in multiple ways. In January his wife Elsa and then in February his eldest son Ignaz died, and he himself fell ill. Moreover, after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria to the Third Reich the Kuffner family was subjected to the full range of harassments and physical threats which the newly empowered National Socialists could mount against Jewish industrialists. On March 13, 1938 Moriz averted a forceful attempt by a [[Sturmabteilung]] to take over the brewery only by placing his single non-Jewish executive - the laboratory director - formally in charge of the company. In a desperate attempt to salvage whatever he could before the family had to leave Vienna, Moriz' son Stephan Kuffner negotiated the sale of the brewery to an "Aryan" industrialist for 14 million Schilling. Although this was much more than Jewish proprietors of comparable assets had to settle for, it represented only a fraction of the brewery's actual valuation at this time. The government approved the transaction on June 6, 1938 and immediately fined the new owner, Gustav Harmer, a penalty tax of 3 million Reichsmark for "attempts to disguise Jewish property."

With the assistance of a fellow alpinist&lt;ref&gt;The Moriz und Elsa von Kuffner-Stiftung names Zsigmondy but it was shurely not the famous mountaineer [[Emil Zsigmondy]] who died already in 1885 &lt;/ref&gt; Moriz von Kuffner - an already very old and very ill man - obtained an immigration permit for Switzerland. Of course he had to pay the [[Reich Flight Tax|''Reichsfluchtsteuer'']] (the emigration tax) before leaving the Third Reich; it amounted to 3 million Reichmark. Kuffner died on March 5, 1939 in Zürich's [[Hirslanden]] clinic and was interred at the Rehalp cemetery in the [[Weinegg]] district.

==Post-war restitution==
The modalities of compensation which were negotiated with Kuffner's heirs after World War II have been cited as a positive example for the restitution of Jewish assets that were expropriated under the rule of National Socialism in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Rathkolb O. Restitutionsvergleich – Die Dokumentation eines Falles. Private expertise. Vienna, June 6, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The owners of the Ottakring brewery made contact with the Kuffner family as soon as 1945. In August 1950 an agreement was reached under which Moriz' seven entitled heirs received $440,000; Stephan Kuffner received [[Schwechat]] brewery stock worth one million Austrian Schillings. In return, the Kuffner family waived their rights to the Palais Kuffner. Those parts of the confiscated Kuffner library which had been incorporated into the [[Austrian National Library]] were restituted by the state.

==The Kuffner foundation==
In 1960 Stephan Kuffner established the Moriz und Elsa von Kuffner foundation in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg C. Die Moriz und Elsa von Kuffner-Stiftung. Nov. 30, 1999. [http://www.kuffner.ch/img/Artikel_MEKS_301199.pdf Online PDF] (German) Accessed: 2009-05-31. [https://www.webcitation.org/5hAt9HBkT Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; It supports collaborative projects in remote Swiss mountain areas and [[nurse education]].

==Honors==
In 2006 the main-belt [[asteroid]] [[12568 Kuffner]] was named in honor of Moriz von Kuffner's sponsorship of astronomy.

A '''plastic forming machine''', or plastic molding machine, is developed on the basis of rubber machinery and metal [[die-casting]] machine. Since the polymer [[injection molding]] process and molding equipment in the 1870s, as an industry, plastic forming machines were rapidly developed until the 1930s, with the gradual commercialization of plastic molding equipment, injection molding and [[extrusion molding]] became the most common industrialized processing methods. [[Blow molding]] is the third-largest plastic molding method after the injection molding and extrusion blow molding method, it is also the fastest development of plastic molding method.

==Types of plastic forming machine==

===Plastic injection molding machine===
{{Main|Injection molding machine}}

===Plastic extrusion machine===
{{further|Plastics extrusion}}
To plastic extrusion machine, plastic extruder is usually called the host, and its follow-up equipments are called the plastic auxiliary equipments. 
With about 100 years of development, plastic extruder derived from single screw to twin-screw, multi screw or no screw and other models. Plastic extruder (the host) can match with the pipe, film, holding materials, monofilament, flat, packing tape, crowded network, plate (sheet) material, profile, granulation, cable coating and other kinds of plastic molding auxiliary equipment, composed of a variety of plastic extrusion production lines, to produce various plastic products. Therefore, either now or in the future, plastic extrusion machine are used widely in plastics processing industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">A statement passed in 1901 by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), the '''Scranton Declaration''' made [[Craft unionism|craft autonomy]] the cornerstone of the organization. Craft unionism meant that unions were formed on the basis of the trade practiced by a group of skilled workers.

For example, in the printing trades, a printer had once been able to perform all the duties in the print shop. But with the development of machinery and printing techniques, different skills became necessary for each step of the printing process. These skills developed into separate trades, and the printing process involved "compositors, pressmen, feeders, stereotypers, bookbinders, electrotypers, and photoengravers." These various trades had all belonged to the Typographical Union, but between 1889 and 1903 all except for the compositors left to form their own craft unions. The AFL supported this process of separation by skill.

In some cases, the AFL forced affiliates to merge. After a decade of jurisdictional warfare between the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America|United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners]] (UBCJ) and the Amalgamated Wood-Workers International (AWWI), which did the same type of work, the UBCJ threatened to secede from the federation. The AFL revoked the charter of the weaker AWWI and forced them to join the Carpenters' union.

Some powerful AFL affiliates successfully resisted pressure to split into separate crafts. The [[United Mine Workers]] had been formed as an [[Industrial unionism|industrial union]]. They demanded, and were granted, the right to include craftsmen &amp;mdash; "hoisting engineers, firemen, blacksmiths, carpenters" &amp;mdash; into their industrial union locals.&lt;ref&gt;A History of American Labor, Joseph G. Rayback, 1966, page 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scranton Declaration, sometimes called the "Autonomy Declaration," was re-affirmed in 1912, repudiating an argument made by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] that trade unions are too rigid to meet changing demands. About one-third of the delegates voted for an industrial union proposal put forward by the AFL-affiliated United Mine Workers. Even so, by 1922 the AFL had repeatedly voted down all resolutions endorsing industrial unionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later he became the station's Sales and Marketing Director. By 1987 he was both the managing director of the station and popular host of the highly rated '''Morning Zoo'''.

Ho has been nicknamed variously ''Godfather'' and ''King of Gambling'', reflecting the [[government-granted monopoly]] he held on the [[Macau]] gambling industry for 40 years. His wealth is divided amongst his daughter [[Pansy Ho]] ($5.3 b)&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/chiu-king-ho|title=Pansy Catilina Ho|work=Bloomberg Billionaires Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; who owns [[MGM Macau]], fourth wife [[Angela Leong]] ($4.1 bln)&lt;ref name="Forbes The World's Billionaires 2017: Angela Leong"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/angela-leong|title=Angela Leong|work=The World's Billionaires 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is managing director of [[Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau|SJM Holdings]], and son [[Lawrence Ho]] ($2.6 b)&lt;ref name="Forbes The World's Billionaires 2017: Lawrence Ho"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/lawrence-ho|title=Lawrence Ho|work=The World's Billionaires 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who owns [[City of Dreams (casino)|City of Dreams]].

Ho is also the founder and Chairman of [[Shun Tak Holdings]], through which he owns many kinds of business including entertainment, tourism, shipping, [[real estate]], banking, and air transport. It is estimated that his enterprises employ almost one fourth of the workforce of Macau.

Apart from Hong Kong and Macau, he has also invested in [[mainland China]], [[Portugal]], [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] where he operates a casino, [[Vietnam]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mozambique]], [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]].

Ho is also an industrialist and entrepreneur in Asia and has held a number of important positions in many firms in Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. His opinions and statements on Hong Kong's real estate and commercial development have considerable sway on the market. In the past few years he has been involved in litigation with his own sister, Winnie Ho, concerning the ownership of the Macau casino.  Having suffered a stroke in July 2009, followed by a long period of recovery, Ho began steps in late 2010, subsequently hotly disputed and in confusing circumstances (January 2011), to devolve his grip on his financial empire to his various wives and children.

== Early life ==
Ho is descended from great-grandfather, Englishman Charles Henry Maurice Bosman (of [[History of Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish Dutch]] origins), and his Shanghainese mistress.  His grandfather was [[Ho Fook]] (何福), brother of the great merchant Sir [[Robert Hotung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hong Kong Biography|last=Ho|first=Eric P|editor=Elizabeth Sinn|date=2012|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789888083664}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187,195}}  Ho is the ninth of thirteen children of Ho Sai-kwong (何世光).

Ho studied at [[Queen's College, Hong Kong]], at which he attended Class D - the lowest class level in the then Hong Kong Class System - owing to unsatisfactory academic results.  After realizing that studying assiduously was the only way to improve his social status, his hard work paid off and earned him a scholarship to the [[University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;"Asia's Wealth Club: Who's Really Who in Business – The Top 100 Billionaires in Asia" {{ISBN|1-85788-162-1}} – Geoff Hiscock.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first student from Class D to be granted a university [[scholarship]]. His university studies were cut short by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1942, he fled from the Japanese and settled in Macau.

=== Career ===

Ho began clerical work at a Japanese-owned import-export firm in Macau. He made his first fortune smuggling luxury goods across the Chinese border from Macau during World War II.&lt;ref name=struggles&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/360176/1/.html "Billionaire Stanley Ho's struggles to adapt to new Macau"], [[Channel News Asia]], 14 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he set up a [[kerosene]] company and established a construction company with his money.

Ho, along with partners, including Hong Kong tycoon [[Henry Fok]], Macau gambler [[Yip Hon]] and his brother-in-law [[Teddy Yip (businessman)|Teddy Yip]], bid for Macau franchises.  By bidding high and promising to promote tourism and to develop [[infrastructure]], they won the public tender for Macau's gaming monopoly at a cost of approximately '(US?)''$410,000{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}, defeating the long-time Macau casino barons, the Fu family. In 1961 the company was renamed [[Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau]], S.A.R.L. (STDM). Business at its flagship [[Casino Lisboa, Macau|Lisboa Casino Hotel]] blossomed, the hotel later to become well-known internationally. In the same year, Ho also set up [[Shun Tak Holdings Ltd]], which was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. Through a subsidiary, [[TurboJET]], it owns one of the world's largest fleets of high-speed jetfoils, which ferry passengers between Hong Kong and Macau.

Ho's investments in Macau are diverse. In 1989, after STDM took full control of the [[Macau Jockey Club]], Ho became its chairman and chief executive officer. In 1998 Ho became the first living Macanese [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] to have a local street named after him.  He also launched Asia's first [[association football|football]] and basketball lottery, called SLOT.

Ho was named by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]], citing the [[Manila Standard Today|''Manila Standard'']] newspaper, as having a link to the Kung Lok [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to "several illegal activities"&lt;ref name= "Asian Organized Crime in Canada"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/AsianOrgCrime_Canada.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; during the period 1999–2002. Ho's alleged ties to Chinese organized crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated his ties to American casino operator [[MGM Mirage]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/03/17/business/AP-US-MGM-Mirage-Pansy-Ho.html|title=N.J.

== Family ==
Ho has 17 children born to four women. Ho refers to his children's mothers as his wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanley Ho confirms share transfer to wives, daughter Angela shocked|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/news/stanley-ho-confirms-share-transfer-to-wives-daughter-angela-shocked/story-e6frg90x-1225995508421|work=The Australian | first1=Shai|last1=Oster|first2=Kate|last2=O'Keeffe|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polygamy remained legal in Hong Kong until 1971.&lt;ref name=scmp20110127ng/&gt;

In 1942 Ho married his first wife, Clementina Leitão, from the prestigious Portuguese Leitão family ([[Traditional Chinese|Chinese]]:黎登)– her grandfather was a lawyer and Macau's only notary public at the time. They had four children. Leitão was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 1973, and suffered partial memory loss as a result. In 1981, Ho's and Leitão's son Robert and daughter-in-law [[Suki Potier]] died in a car accident. Leitão died in 2004 and was buried in the St. Michael the Archangel Cemetery ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]: Cemitério São Miguel Arcanjo).

In the late 1950s Ho met his second wife Lucina Azul Jean Ying née Laam King-ying, whom he legally married in Hong Kong in 1962 via a legal loophole rooted in the [[Great Qing Legal Code]]. The marriage resulted in five children including daughters [[Daisy Ho]], to whom Ho ceded the chairmanship of SJM,&lt;ref name=Reuters2018 /&gt; and [[Pansy Ho]], a 50 percent partner in MGM Macau; son [[Lawrence Ho]], CEO of Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd, another Macau-based casino company; and [[Josie Ho]] (何超儀), a rock singer and award-winning actress. Lucina's family now resides in Canada.

Ina Chan became Ho's third 'wife' in 1985. Ho's first wife Clementina Leitão needed constant nursing care following her car accident, and Ina Chan was one of the nurses brought in to look after Leitão. Ho and Chan have three children; Laurinda Ho, Florinda Ho, and Orlando Ho.

Fourth 'wife' [[Leong On-kei|Angela Leong On-kei]], with whom Ho has had four children, met Ho in 1988 as his dance instructor.&lt;ref name=scmp20110127ng&gt;Ng Yuk-hang &amp; Wong, Martin (27 January 2011). "Ho the daddy of them all when it comes to his hectic love life", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Ho and Leong's children are Sabrina Ho, Arnaldo Ho, Mario Ho and Alice Ho. Leung is now the incumbent member of Legislative Assembly in Macau.

===Non-linear relations===

* Ambassador Eric Hotung, a billionaire grandson of Sir [[Robert Hotung]], was a second cousin of Ho, and had a long-running relationship with Ho's sister Winnie Ho - the couple had a son, Michael Ho, but Hotung fell out with his former lover and Michael and sued them for recovery of money allegedly loaned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1952212/rift-between-hong-kong-billionaire-and-secret-lover-over Rift between Hong Kong billionaire and secret lover over soured Macau casino deal laid bare in court], SCMP, 24 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another of Ho's sisters, Susie Ho, is the widow of one of his former business partners, [[Teddy Yip (businessman)|Teddy Yip]].
* According to available records, [[Bruce Lee]] and Stanley Ho are second cousins through Lee's mother, Grace Ho (何爱瑜). Her father, Ho Kom-tong (何甘棠), and Ho's grandfather, [[Ho Fook]], were brothers.
* Distant family around Asia such as the Ho family in Singapore. Relatives include Jason Ho, George Ho, Rebecca Ho Tsui-nam, and Ho Khai-wan.

== Personal life ==
Over the years, dancing has been one of Ho's favourite hobbies, achieving excellence in [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], and [[waltz]].  He often danced for televised charity fundraisers and has sponsored numerous dance performances in Hong Kong and Macau, including the [[Hong Kong Arts Festival]] and the Macau Arts Festival, promoting the art of dance. He has also invited internationally renowned dancing groups, such as the [[National Ballet of China]], to perform in Hong Kong and Macau. Ho is a patron of the [[Hong Kong Ballet]], the [[International Dance Teachers Association]] and is a Fellow of the [[Royal Academy of Dance]]. One of a number of [[thoroughbred]] [[racehorse|racehorses]] owned by Ho, [[Viva Pataca]], named after the [[Macanese pataca|currency of Macau]], won several top Hong Kong races in 2006 and 2007.

In late July 2009, Ho suffered a fall at his home that required brain surgery. For seven months Ho was confined to the [[Hong Kong Adventist Hospital – Stubbs Road|Hong Kong Adventist Hospital]] and, later, the [[Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital]], during which period he made only one public appearance, on 20 December 2009, when he travelled to Macau to meet Chinese president [[Hu Jintao]] on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Macau's return to Chinese sovereignty. Ho was discharged from the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital on 6 March 2010 and has since used a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;http://mytv.tvb.com/news/newsat730/105320/1025#page-1  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615053758/http://mytv.tvb.com/news/newsat730/105320/1025 |date=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===

==== Qing relics ====
In 2003, Ho donated a Qing dynasty bronze boar's head to China's Poly Art Museum, a state-run organisation that aims to develop, display, rescue and protect Chinese cultural relics.  The boar's head is part of a collection of 12 looted from the imperial Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860 when it was sacked and burnt by French and British armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7918933.stm|title=Chinese zodiac statues' origins|last=|first=|date=2009-03-03|website=BBC News|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September 2007, Ho donated to the Chinese government a [[Qing dynasty]] bronze sculpture of a horse's head originally taken from the [[Old Summer Palace]]. Ho had reportedly just purchased it from a Taiwanese businessman for US$8.84&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119031552561934214?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=In Macau, Moguls Bet Big on Donated Art|author=Geoffrey A. Fowler|date=21 September 2007|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lanceford dispute===
In late January 2011, a dispute erupted among his wives and children involving the transfer of ownership of his private holding company, Lanceford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703555804576102892126323426 |title=Family Feud Grips Stanley Ho Casino Empire - WSJ.com |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December Lanceford allotted 9,998 new shares, representing 99.98 per cent of its enlarged share capital, to two [[British Virgin Islands]] companies:  Action Winner Holdings Ltd, wholly owned by third wife, Ina, holding 50.55 per cent and Ranillo Investments Ltd, equally held by each of Laam's five children, holding the balance. The allotment document filed with the Registrar of Companies was signed by Laam's daughter Daisy.&lt;ref&gt;Gough, Neil (27 January 2011). "What Ho did when he found out he was poor", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho issued proceedings in the High Court, naming its directors – 11 defendants, including his second and third wives, and children Pansy and Lawrence Ho, alleging the group "improperly and/or illegally" acted in changing the share structure.  The writ sought an injunction restraining the defendants from selling or disposing any of the 9,998 new shares in the company.  The two British Virgin Islands companies were also named in the writ. Ho said his intention from the outset was to divide his assets equally among his families and that the actions of the directors of Lanceford effectively eliminated this possibility, according to a statement issued by his lawyer Gordon Oldham.&lt;ref name=20110128hks/&gt;

Amidst confusion caused by conflicting statements from Ho and his wives and children about the state of the dispute, Ho, through Oldham – who had been allegedly sacked and rehired within the space of a few days – said he had been pressured to make public statements and sign legal documents without him being fully apprised of their contents.&lt;ref name=20110128hks&gt;Wong, Natalie (28 January 2011). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=107584&amp;sid=31084029&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20110128&amp;sear_year=2011 "See you in court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203336/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=107584&amp;sid=31084029&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20110128&amp;sear_year=2011 |date=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What was to become a saga of soap-opera proportions ensued including official video postings of statements on [[YouTube]].

== Honours ==
In 1984, Ho was awarded an honorary doctorate of social sciences from the [[University of Macau]] in 1984. In the [[1990 New Year Honours#Officers .28OBE.29 2|New Year Honours 1990]], Ho was appointed [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (O.B.E.) "for services to the community in Hong Kong"&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51981 |date=30 December 1989 |page=16 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the Portuguese government appointed Ho to the ''Grã-Cruz da [[Order of Infante D. Henrique|Ordem do Infante Dom Henrique]]'' (Great Cross of the Order of Prince Henrique), the highest honour for any civilian, for his contributions to society.  In 1998, Dr Stanley Ho Avenue in Macau was named, the first Chinese person to be so honoured in Macau during their lifetime.

In 2003 Ho received the [[Hong Kong honours system|Gold Bauhinia Star]] from the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], [[Tung Chee Hwa]], in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the community, in promoting education, sports and other community services for youth. In 2008 Ho received the Medal for Business Entrepreneurialism from the city of [[Cascais]] and the street running adjacent to the [[Estoril Casino]] was renamed as Avenida Stanley Ho.  It was the first road in Portugal to be named after a living Chinese citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algarveresident.com/story.asp?XID=22576 "Cascais honours Stanley Ho"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Algarve Resident'', 9 Oct 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009 he received the Visionary award at the [[Global Gaming Expo|G2E Asia]] conference, organised by the American Gaming Association; the award was delivered by Macau SAR Chief Executive Edmund Ho. In November 2010 Ho was awarded the [[Grand Bauhinia Medal]] the highest under the Hong Kong honors and awards system, reserved for those making a lifelong and highly significant contribution to the well-being of Hong Kong.

In global optimization, a '''state transition algorithm (STA)''' is an [[iterative method]] that generates a sequence of improving approximate solutions for an [[optimization problem]]. Due to its intrinsic properties, an STA has the ability to find a global optimal solution in probability and can guarantee an optimal solution.

The state transition algorithm &lt;ref name=Zhou2012State/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2014Nonlinear/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Optimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Discrete/&gt; was first proposed by Zhou et al. It is a stochastic global optimization method and aims to find a possible global or approximate optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. In the context of the STA, a solution to an optimization problem is regarded as a state, and updating a solution can be regarded as a state transition. Using the state-space representation,&lt;ref name=Friedland2005Control/&gt; it describes solutions updating in a unified framework, and the execution operators to update solutions are expressed as state transition matrices, which make it easy to understand and flexible to implement:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \mathbf{x}_k + B_k \mathbf{u}_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; stands for a current state, corresponding to a solution to an optimization problem;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and historical states;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_k &lt;/math&gt; is the fitness value at &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;;  
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_k, \mathbf{B}_k &lt;/math&gt; are state transformation matrices, which can be considered as execution operators; 
:  &lt;math&gt; f(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is the objective function or evaluation function. 
As a stochastic global optimization method, STA has the following properties:
* globality, STA has the ability to search the whole space;
* optimality, STA can guarantee to find an optimal solution; 
* convergence, the sequence generated by STA is convergent;
* rapidity, inherent advantages existing in STA to reduce the computational complexity;
* controllability, STA can control the search space flexibly.

In continuous STA, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous variable, and four special state transformation operators are designed to generate new candidate solutions.

=== State transformation operators ===
(1) Rotation transformation (RT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \frac{1}{n\|\mathbf{x}_k\|_2} R_r \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the rotation factor, &lt;math&gt; R_r \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random matrix with its entries being uniformly distributed random variables defined on the interval [-1,1], and &lt;math&gt; \|\cdot\| &lt;/math&gt; is the 2-norm of a vector. 
The rotation transformation has the functionality to search in a hypersphere with maximal radius &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; , that is to say, &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}\|_2 \leq \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

(2) Translation transformation (TT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \beta R_t \frac{\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}}{\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}\|_2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the translation factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_t \in  \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
is a uniformly distributed random variable defined on the interval [0,1]. The translation transformation has the functionality to search along a line from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k-1} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; at the starting point &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; with maximal length &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;.

(3) Expansion transformation (ET)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \gamma R_e \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the expansion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_e \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution. The expansion transformation has the functionality to expand the entries in  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; to the range of &lt;math&gt; [-\infty, +\infty] &lt;/math&gt;, searching in the whole space.

(4) Axesion transformation (AT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \delta R_a \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the axesion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_a \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution and with only one random position having nonzero value. The axesion transformation aims to search along the axes.

=== Regular neighbourhood and sampling ===
For a given solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;, a candidate solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; is generated by using one time of the aforementioned state transformation operators. Since the state transition matrix in each state transformation is random, the generated candidate solution is not unique. Based on a given point, it is not difficult to imagine that a '''regular neighbourhood''' will be automatically formed when using certain state transformation operators.

Since the entries in state transition matrix obey certain stochastic distribution, for any given solution, the new candidate becomes a random vector and its corresponding solution (the value of a random vector) can be regarded as a '''sample'''. Considering that any two random state transition matrices in each state transformation operator are independent,
several times of state transformation (called the degree of search enforcement, &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; for short) based on the given solution are performed for certain state transformation operator, yielding &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples.

=== An update strategy ===
As mentioned above, based on the incumbent best solution, a total number of ''SE'' candidate solutions are sampled. A new best solution is selected from the candidate set by virtue of the evaluation function, denoted as &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt;. 
Then, an update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' is used to update the incumbent best solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{newBest} &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; f(\text{newBest}) &lt; f(\text{Best}), &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{Best} &lt;/math&gt; , otherwise

=== Algorithm procedure of the basic continuous STA ===
With the state transformation operators, sampling technique and update strategy, the basic continuous STA can be described as follows:

Step 1: Initiate a random solution &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} = 1, \alpha_{\min} = 10^{-4}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \beta = 1, \gamma = 1, \delta = 1, fc = 2, k = 0; &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Expansion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . Let us denote &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt; the best solution in &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples, if &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 3: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Rotation Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 4: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Axesion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 5: set &lt;math&gt; k = k + 1 &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_{\min} &lt;/math&gt;, set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;, else set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha /fc &lt;/math&gt;, and return to Step 2 until the maximum of iterations is met.

=== Philosophy behind the continuous STA ===
* The '''expansion transformation''' contributes to the globality since it has the functionality to search the whole space; 
*  The '''rotation transformation''' benefits the optimality since when &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small, the incumbent best solution becomes a local optimal solution;
* The update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' contributes to the convergence, that is to say, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{f(\text{Best}_k)_{k=1}^\infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent due to &lt;math&gt; f(\text{Best}_{k+1}) \leq f(\text{Best}_k) &lt;/math&gt; and the [[monotone convergence theorem]];
* The '''sampling technique''' (it can avoid complete enumeration) and the '''alternate use''' of state transformation operators help to reduce computational complexity;
* The parameters like &lt;math&gt; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta &lt;/math&gt; can be adjusted to control the search space.

==Applications of STA==

STA has found a variety of applications, like image segmentation,&lt;ref name=Han2015multi/&gt; 
task assignment,&lt;ref name=Dong2015discrete/&gt; energy consumption in the alumina evaporation process,&lt;ref name=Wang2016Optimization/&gt; resolution of overlapping linear

The 1838 '''Treaty of Balta Limani''', or the [[Anglo-Ottoman Treaty]], is a formal trade agreement signed between the [[Sublime Porte]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[The United Kingdom]]. The trade policies imposed upon the Ottoman Empire, after the Treaty of Balta Limani, are considered to be some of the most liberal, open market, settlements that had ever been enacted during the time. The terms of the treaty stated that, the Ottoman Empire will abolish all monopolies, allow British merchants and their collaborators to have full access to all Ottoman markets and will be taxed equally to local merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geyikdağı, V. Necla|title=Foreign Investment in the Ottoman Empire: International Trade and Relations 1854-1914|year=2011|publisher=Tauris Academic Studies|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements did not constitute an equal [[free trade]] arrangement, as The United Kingdom still employed [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] on their agricultural markets.

Leading up to the Treaty of Balta Limani, in the fall of 1831 the Governor of Egypt, [[Mehmet Ali Pasha]], retaliated against the Ottoman Empire. Mehmet Ali had not been given the territory that Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, had promised him, after he showed military expertise in defeating Greek rebels in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartesveldt, Fred Van|title=Henry Buwler and the Convention of Balta Liman|journal=Columbus State University Archives|year=1980|volume=Dissertation|series=Fort Valley State College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Ali Pasha’s son, Ibrahim Pasha, led the Egyptian army to storm Lebanon and Syria, quickly defeating Ottoman forces. Mahmud II appealed to Britain and France for help, though neither would intervene. Reluctantly the Empire turned to Russia for help, which in turn stopped Ali Pasha’s advancements. After a round of negotiations Egypt was able to retain most of the conquered land, though neither party was truly satisfied with the outcome. Tensions between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, along with fears of Russian intervention, gave the United Kingdom an incentive to negotiate with the Ottomans, to gain the upper-hand in trade agreements. The UK took advantage of the unrest and offered its hand in helping the Ottoman Empire defeat Mehmet Ali Pasha, in exchange for complete access to Ottoman trade markets.

== Background==
[[File:Territorial changes of the Ottoman Empire 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|Territorial changes of the Ottoman Empire 1830]]
*Greece was recognized as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom in the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]].

=== Rise of Muhammad Ali Pasha ===
Between the years 1803 and 1807 civil war broke out in Egypt among the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks, and Albanian mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garvin, J. L|title=Egypt: Modern History. Rule of Mehmed Ali.|year=1911|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmet Ali Pasha]] emerged victorious from the battle. Egypt was still under Ottoman control, so when Sultan Mahmud II recognized him as the official Egyptian Governor, his rule was legitimized. During his reign, Mehmet Ali Pasha gained much recognition for industrial and economic reforms in Egypt. Irrigation systems were repaired which led to a booming cotton industry.&lt;ref name="Garvin1911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garvin, J. L|title=Egypt: Modern History. Rule of Mehmed Ali.|year=1911|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; His administration also tackled important infrastructure issues, including the construction of the Mahmoudiya Canal, which allowed water access to the port of Alexandria from the Nile River. Mehmet Ali's economic policies relied heavily on the use of monopolies to control market prices of goods.&lt;ref name="Geyikda2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geyikdağı, V. Necla|title=Foreign Investment in the Ottoman Empire: International Trade and Relations 1854-1914|year=2011|publisher=Tauris Academic Studies|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During his reign, Mehmet Ali gained considerable favor in the European world, specifically with France, due to his westernized reforms.  He promoted education reform, specifically in the fields of arts and sciences. Also, with much European benefit, Mehmet Ali strengthened trade from India to the western nations; though, still capitalized on middle-man transactions.

Mehmet Ali was nominally loyal to the Ottoman Empire, and led an invasion against the Saudis in 1811 at the request of the Sultan. While abroad he became suspicious that the Ottomans were planning to overthrow his rule in Egypt, so he returned to Cairo. Mehmet Ali was prone to act autonomously and made important decisions without first gaining approval from the authorities of the Ottoman Empire. During the time under Mahmud II, reformist efforts were being made to centralize the government and punish peripheral states which acted outside the Porte’s will. However, Egypt amassed so much regional power that the Sultan could not take any simple measures to cut back Mehmet Ali’s power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sukru|title=A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire|year=2008|publisher=Princeton UP|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|'''Muhammad Ali Pasha''' with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph Sève (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]]]]

Mehmet Ali was well aware of Mahmud’s efforts to cut back regional power and had always been suspicious of the rule of the Sultan. In precautionary steps, the Egyptian Governor had been building up his army and naval fleets with the help of French instructors. With his well-trained army, Mehmet Ali was able to suppress a revolt of Albanian troops in Cairo.  Mahmud II acknowledged the skills of Mehmet Ali's army and offered him the pashaliks of Syria and Morea (which was the name for the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece), in return for aid in suppressing Greek revolts. Mehmet Ali and his son Ibrahim agreed and led a fierce campaign in the Mediterranean Sea, which began in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartesveldt, Fred Van|title=Henry Buwler and the Convention of Balta Liman|journal=Columbus State University Archives|year=1980|volume=Dissertation|series=Fort Valley State College|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years of fighting, Mehmet Ali was never granted the land promised to Egypt after helping aid Ottoman efforts to end the Greek rebellion. At this point Ali Pasha knew his army was superior to the Ottoman’s army and he was angry with Mahmud for denying him the promised territory. He had a growing ship industry and needed more natural resources in order to meet demand, and he felt the Ottomans would soon attempt to exert their power over him. These factors led Mehemet Ali to storm the Ottoman territories. In 1831 he sent troops through Lebanon and up to Syria along the shores of the Mediterranean; and conquered Ottoman lands all the way to Konia, which is in the heart of [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sukru|title=A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire|year=2008|publisher=Princeton UP|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sultan Mahmud II quickly realized that he would need an ally in order to defend himself against the forces of Mehemet Ali. First he turned to Britain and France for support, though he was promptly turned down. The Ottoman Empire had no other choice than to seek the help of a known enemy, Russia.

[[File:Mamluke.jpg|thumb|left|Mamluk cavalryman]]

===The Hunkar Iskelesi Treaty of August 1833===
Russia Czar, Nicolas I, agreed to help Mahmud, and immediately sent troops to stop Egypt’s advance into Anatolia. It was not an easy move to make on Mahmud’s part; public unrest ensued after forming an alliance with Russia. Many were disturbed by the alliance considering that just a few years before, the Ottoman Empire lost land in the Balkans to Russian encroachments.

The looming Russian force encouraged negotiations between the Sublime Porte and Egypt in the spring of 1833. Ultimately, Mehemet Ali came out of the peace negotiations &amp;ndash; agreed upon at the Convention of Kütahya &amp;ndash; with all of Egypt, Syria, Jeddah, Crete, Adana and Sudan. He was also promised that his sons could keep his lineage alive as rulers of Egypt, indefinitely. On the other hand, as payment for Russian support, the Ottoman Empire had to agree to close the [[Dardanelles]], the passage between the Sea of Marmara and the Mediterranean, to warships if Russia was ever attacked.

The British and the French were not happy with the Hunkar Iskelesi Treaty{{Clarify|reason=Is this the same as the Convention of Kütahya? |date=February 2014}}. The French had all along quietly been backing the reign of Mehemet Ali in Egypt and would have been happy to see the Ottoman Empire crumble. France had taken an interest in North Africa and seized Algeria from weak Ottoman rule, just prior to the treaty. France also had strong diplomatic ties with Mehmet Ali Pasha. The British now feared Russia’s growing influence over the Ottoman Empire. The UK could not permit Russia to take over the Ottoman Empire, because that expansion would pose as a major threat to Western Europe. After the Hunkar Iskelesi treaty, England considered the survival of the Ottoman Empire a worthwhile cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geyikdağı, V. Necla|title=Foreign Investment in the Ottoman Empire: International Trade and Relations 1854-1914|year=2011|publisher=Tauris Academic Studies|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French and British diplomats were even more alarmed at Russia’s involvement in the Ottoman Empire when the Munchengratz Agreement was signed in 1833. The Munchengratz Agreement was authorized by Prussia, Austria and Russia; and it stated that each nation would stand alongside one another in any future decisions, especially any decisions concerning the state of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Hartesveldt1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartesveldt, Fred Van|title=Henry Buwler and the Convention of Balta Liman|journal=Columbus State University Archives|year=1980|volume=Dissertation|series=Fort Valley State College|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement did not state any new treaties, though it made a public display of the nations' unity on issues concerning the Ottoman Empire, which appeared to be in its final decline.

=== Timeline of events ===
*'''1830-''' The Ottomans lose the war to the Greeks; Greece gains independence from the Ottoman Empire.
*'''1830-''' The French seize Algeria from the Ottoman Empire and begin to colonize Northern Africa.
*'''1833-''' The Hunkar Iskelesi Treaty defensively align Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The Munchengratz Agreement publicly reasserts Russian, Austrian and Prussian unity. The Convention of Kütahya ends war between Ottoman and Egyptian forces, and grants Egypt land won during battle.
*'''1834-''' Mehmet Ali Pasha, now in control of Syria, experiences troubles.  The Syrians had once welcomed the Egyptian Governor, championing him as the “pioneer of European civilization in the east”; nevertheless, the Syrian economy is hurt under the monopoly policies of his regime.&lt;ref name="Garvin1911" /&gt; Syrians revolt against Ali Pasha, but are quickly defeated and terrorized shortly after.
*'''1834-''' Trade Capitulations between the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom expire after 14 years.  After taking into account the increases of international prices, customs duties would have to be raised to make up for inflation. The UK is unwilling to renew the agreement with raised customs duties. The Secretary at the British Embassy in Constantinople, David Urquhart, begins to draft a new trade agreement.&lt;ref name="Geyikda2011" /&gt;
*'''1835-''' British diplomats attempt to work with Ali Pasha, in the hopes of building more trade infrastructure throughout new Egyptian territories. At the request of Lord Palmerston, England wants to build rail lines connecting the Syrian coast to the Euphrates and on to the Persian Gulf. Mehmet Ali denies this request, as well as a less extravagant one for another rail line.&lt;ref name="Hartesveldt1980" /&gt;
*'''1838-''' The Treaty of Balta Liman is signed by the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire. The relations between the Sultan and Egypt are extremely volatile. The Treaty would thwart Russian power over the Ottoman Empire and benefit English producers significantly. Though the Ottomans would gain slightly from increased trade, the main incentive is to bring down Mehmet Ali by abolishing monopolies, Egypt’s primary source of income.

===Intended outcomes of the treaty===
In 1820 the U.K. and the Ottoman Empire had established a Trade Tariff that would expire in 14 years. After 1834 neither party wanted to renew the original agreement as it stood; so, Reşit Pasha (advisor to the Sultan), David Urquhart (an English diplomat), Lord Posonby (the British Ambassador) and Counsel General John Cartwright, worked to form the Treaty of Balta Liman. David Urquhart was sent to Istanbul to befriend Reşit Pasha and convince him the treaty would be of benefit to the Ottoman State. Urquhart worked hard to convince Ottoman notables that the treaty was in their favor. He published articles in Istanbul’s newspapers, listing the benefits of free trade markets; his propaganda influenced the capital city deeply. France and Russia watched the negotiations of the treaty closely. Russia feared losing its newfound Ottoman interests, and the French may have had to consider switching sides if Britain aligned itself with the Sultan against Mehmet Ali Pasha of Egypt.

''''British Aims:'''' The UK was leading the world in the industrial revolution and needed a bigger market and more resources in order to expand. So, it would benefit England the most to engage in as much trade with the Ottoman Empire as possible, with very little restrictions on the open market. Further, the British wanted the Ottomans to accept the treaty as quickly as possible. England needed to strike the deal while the Ottoman Empire was in a tight spot with Egypt so it would have less room to negotiate. England had to convince Mahmud II that the treaty would end Mehmet Ali’s reign. Egypt’s economy was largely controlled through the use of monopolies; if monopolies were abolished, Egypt’s economy would crumble. Also, opening Egyptian markets, with no protections, to the UK’s industrial goods market would crush its infant industries. England did not want to see the Ottoman Empire fall into the hands of Russia either. Russia would not engage in free trade with Britain, and there would be no benefits of market inequalities that would form between the Ottoman Empire and England after the treaty.

The [[balance of trade]] up until the mid 19th century was in favour of the Ottoman Empire which, in the years 1820-22, exported goods worth £650,000 to the United Kingdom.  By 1836-38, that figure had reached £1,729,000.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the majority of the share of trade was made by Ottoman merchants, the Europeans, especially the British and the French, became irritated and unhappy with this trade arrangement and pushed for intervention and transformation of the economic policies of the Middle East. Indeed, the French foreign ambassador posted a letter to Louis-Mathieu, Comte de Mole in 1837 stating:
{{cquote|I realized with pleasure that for our merchants the main question was not so much the amount of the new duties as their equality and stability.  For what our merchants are requesting is, as far as possible, the abolition of monopolies and prohibitions that have diverted almost the whole export trade into the hands of a small number of favored Barataries.&lt;ref&gt;

''''Ottoman Aims:'''' The Ottoman Empire was offered a deal that would have been hard to resist. Mahmud was never happy with the 1833 land negotiations, and wanted to see Egypt crumble. Tensions between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire clearly suggested the possibility of war. With new British alliances, fostered through the treaty's economic policy, Mahmud should receive help in ending the Mehmet Ali Pasha regime before the Empire was destroyed. Also, the Ottoman Porte may have been overly naive to the full implications of a liberal, free trade, market. Without infant industry protections the Ottoman Empire had little hope in becoming a fully industrialized economy, as the other world powers were. England was not offering to also freely open its markets up to the Ottoman Empire, so markets could never come to a true equilibrium. It is unclear whether the Porte would have understood these consequences due to the concerted efforts of British diplomats lobbying for the policies in the treaty.

==1838==
The '''Treaty of Balta Liman''' was a [[commercial treaty]] signed in 1838 between the Ottoman Empire and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], regulating [[international trade]]. [[Duty (economics)|Duties]] were set at 3% on imports; 3% on exports; 9% on transiting exported goods; and 2% on transiting imported goods.&lt;ref&gt;Convention of Commerce and Navigation, etc. in ''Parliamentary Papers,'' 1838, L, pp.289-295&lt;/ref&gt; Given the tradition of the "Most Favored Country Status," these conditions were extended to France. The Ottomans also agreed to the abolition of all [[Monopoly|monopolies]]. Factors that helped shape the treaty included the writings of David Urquhart, who had advocated for the abolition of monopolies (of which opium was the most prominent outside of Egypt) in order to bolster further trade with the Ottoman Empire and decrease British dependency on Russian raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZppNAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title = Turkey and Its Resources: Its Municipal Organization and Free Trade; the State and Prospects of English Commerce in the East; the New Administration of Greece, Its Revenue and National Possessions | author1 = Urquhart | first1 = David | year = 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous complaints by British businessmen who were subject to duties levied on goods transshipped across the Ottoman Empire and arbitrary levies by local [[pasha]]s.  These duties were mainly confined to the realm of exports, while imports could be traded at ports for the traditional rate of 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Issawi ''Economic History of Turkey: 1800-1914'' 89-100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention of Commerce, 1838, Balta Liman===

[[Image:Bab-i Ali.jpg|thumb|The Sublime Porte in Ottoman times.]]

One factor that helped the British push the treaty through was the military dispute between rogue Ottoman Governor Mehmet (also known as Muhammed or Mehmed) Ali of Egypt and the Ottoman Imperial Center that dated back to 1831. In 1831, [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]]'s son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] led a successful military expedition into [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], and established himself as governor. This invasion led to Ottoman retaliation and the eruption of hostilities that culminated in 1833, at which point Ibrahim's troops were within striking distance of Istanbul. Russian intervention, however, ended Ibrahim's advance.&lt;ref&gt;Hanioglu, ''A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire''pp. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Mehmet Ali continued to govern Syria, and in May 1838 informed both British and French Consulates of that he resolved to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;"Colonel Campbell to Viscount Palmerston" in "Communications with Mehemet Ali" pp 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This move was opposed by both the Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire, which, under Mahmud II, began preparing for military action to prevent secession.  In the midst of this dispute, on 16 August 1838, the Treaty of Balta Liman was passed.  While there was no clear ''quid pro quo'' agreement, the treaty's passage helped to ensure British support of Ottoman territorial integrity, a position which had in actuality already been held by Palmerston, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, but was formally declared the following month.  When Muhammad Ali refused to implement the agreement because of the threat this posed to his nascent [[industrialisation]] project, [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] gave him a year's grace period, after which Muhammad Ali still refused to comply. Based on the terms of the [[Convention of London (1840)|1840 Convention of London]], the Ottomans, with British assistance, soon [[Oriental Crisis of 1840|attacked and reasserted control]] over Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of the treaty are disputed, but many contend that it opened Ottoman markets to increased British imports and was detrimental to Ottoman producers.

==Effects of the treaty==
The economic effects of the treaty would not be immediately realized in Ottoman markets. Politically however, the Treaty of Balta Limani had serious consequences on the outcome of the Ottoman-Syrian War. After signing the treaty with the English, the Ottomans knew that the United Kingdom was heavily invested the future of the Ottoman Empire. With the British on his side, Sultan Mahmud II would no longer passively stand by while Mehemet Ali of Egypt held Ottoman territory in Syria. In 1839, a year after the Treaty of Balta Limani was signed, the Ottoman Empire declared war on Egypt. On 29 June 1839 Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mehemet Ali, defeated the Ottoman army in the Battle of Nezib. This crushing defeat offered an opportunity for Mehemet Ali Pasha to potentially take control of Constantinople and essentially the entire Ottoman Empire. Shortly after the defeat Mahmud died leaving his 16-year-old heir Abdülmecid in power. Britain, Russia, and Austria all had a considerable stake in the Ottoman Empire, and so they quickly came to the aid of the young Sultan, which led to the 1840 Convention of London.

===1840 Convention of London===
The Convention of London of 1840 was a treaty with the formal title of Convention for the Pacification of the Levant, signed on 15 July 1840 between the European Great Powers of United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia and Russia on the one hand, and the Ottoman Empire on the other. The treaty offered the Egyptians complete rule over Egyptian territories and parts of Sudan as "privileged Ottoman provinces," but they would have to give up captured territories in Syria and Greece. Egypt did not respond to the treaty in the given amount of time because it believed France would back it in further conquest. Mehemet Ali's non-cooperation led to the Oriental Crisis of 1840. Russian and British forces attacked Egyptian forces in Acre and quickly defeated Mehemet Ali's forces. France also did not anticipate entering into war with England. After the crisis France switched sides, and Mehemet Ali realised he would have to accept the offer contained in the treaty.

===Economic consequences===
There are no official trade records for the Ottoman Empire before the year 1878, though it is clear that amount of imports and exports rose shortly after the Treaty of Balta Limani.&lt;ref name=foreign-investment&gt;{{cite book|last=Geyikdağı, V. Necla|title=Foreign Investment in the Ottoman Empire: International Trade and Relations 1854-1914|year=2011|publisher=Tauris Academic Studies|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the treaty undeniably increased trade, imports into the country increased exponetially more than exports, and this crippled Ottoman industry. A 1866 Ottoman report claimed that the number of textile looms in Istanbul and Uskar fell from a reported 2,730 to only 23. Similarly brocade looms went from a previous 350 to only four, and cotton or "nankeen" looms went from 40,000 to only 5,000 in Aleppo.&lt;ref name=foreign-investment/&gt; The rapid influx of cheap British textiles and no protectionist policies would make industrializing a near impossible task for the Ottoman Empire after the Treaty of Balta Limani.

'''Tsai Wan-tsai''' ({{zh|c=蔡萬才}}; 5 August 1929 – 5 October 2014) was a [[Taiwan]]ese [[banker]]. He is one of the brothers of [[Tsai Wan-lin]], and an uncle of [[Tsai Hong-tu]]. Tsai Wan-tsai was a member of the [[Legislative Yuan]], the national parliament of Taiwan. He was also the founder of [[Fubon Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fubon founder dies at 86 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2014/10/06/2003601379 |accessdate=5 October 2014 |publisher=Taipei Times |date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as the fourth richest of Taiwan, with a net worth of [[USD|US$]]5.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/87/biz_taiwanrichest08_Tsai-Wan-tsai_UYFI.html |title=Taiwan's Richest: #4 Tsai Wan-tsai |accessdate=2008-08-01 |work= |publisher=Forbes |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulf Gunnar Ekberg''' (born December 6, 1970), also known as '''Buddha''', is a Swedish singer-songwriter, musician, businessman and television and film producer, best known as a founding member of the pop group [[Ace of Base]], along with siblings [[Jonas Berggren]], [[Linn Berggren]] and [[Jenny Berggren]].

==Life and career==

Ace of Base released its debut album in 1992 and went on to attain major chart success throughout the 1990s.

Ekberg has [[record producer|produced]] several artists, TV productions, films and events and has sold over 40 million records world wide.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Ulf restarted Ace of Base in 2006, touring the world with them from 2007 to 2009. In 2009, he started a new music production/publishing and management company together with Jonas Berggren based in LA, London and Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

After Ekberg experienced the [[tsunami]] in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand, he founded the Surin Relief Fund to support affected children by providing facilities to educate children and care for orphaned children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surinrelieffund.com Surinrelieffund.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008205422/http://www.surinrelieffund.com/ |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Nazi activities===
In its 27 March 1993 edition, the Swedish [[newspaper]] ''[[Expressen]]'' reported that Ekberg had once been a member of a band called "Commit Suiside" [''[[sic]]''], which sang songs with explicit racist lyrics.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;http://noisey.vice.com/blog/ace-of-bases-secret-nazi-past&lt;/ref&gt; Ekberg claims that the cited lyrics were not recorded by Commit Suiside, but says he regrets this past part of his life as a big mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/ace-of-base-nazi-past-lyrics_n_3148797.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Ace of Base Responds To Nazi Allegations | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commit Suiside was a neo-Nazi band active in Gothenburg from 1983 to 1986, when Ulf was between the ages of 13 and 16. Other media outlets reported that Ekberg had been a neo-nazi [[skinhead]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ace_Of_Base/2005/08/24/1186511.html Toronto Sun: Swedish stars holding Aces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonPhoenix"&gt;[http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-08-00/boston_music_4.html The Boston Phoenix: How Swede It Is]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jag är på väg ut ur mörkret|date=17 June 1998|newspaper=Aftonbladet|author=Jörgen Holmstedt|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/noje/9806/17/ulfekberg.html|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he was a part of the leadership of the [[Sweden Democrats]] in [[Gothenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Sverigedemokraterna: den nationella rörelsen]] |last1=Larsson |first1=Stieg |authorlink1=Stieg Larsson |authorlink2=Mikael Ekman |year=2001 |publisher=[[Ordfront]] |location= |isbn=91-7324-877-0 |page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some of his old songs were released on the compilation album ''Uffe was a Nazi!''. Including songs like ''Rör inte vårt land'' (Don't touch our land), ''Vit makt, svartskalleslakt!'' (White Power, black head slaughter) and a cover of [[Skrewdriver]]'s "Smash the IRA", with the lyrics changed to refer to the [[Left Party (Sweden)|VPK]].&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

In the 1997 documentary ''Our Story'', Ekberg said: "I told everyone I really regret what I've done. I closed that book. I don't want to even talk about it, that time does not exist in me any more. I closed it and I threw the book away 1987. I took the experience from it, I learned from it. But that life is not me. It's somebody else."

===Personal life===
Ekberg dated the Swedish model/actress [[Emma Wiklund|Emma Sjöberg]] from 1994 to 2000. He currently lives in [[London]] with his girlfriend Johanna Aybar and their three children: Viggo, Vincent and Valentina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5845">The '''Voter News Service''' was an [[exit poll]]ing [[consortium]] formed in 1990 by six major [[News media (United States)|U.S. news media organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Amy| last=Doan| date=November 29, 2000| title=Antitrust Group Targets Voter News Service| newspaper=Forbes.com| url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/11/29/1129vns.html| accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was to provide results for [[U.S. presidential election|United States presidential elections]], so that individual organizations and networks would not have to do exit polling and vote tallying in parallel.

==Members==
The VNS included major [[United States]] [[television network]]s and [[newspaper]]s:
* Both parties, Republican and Democrat
* [[ABC News]]
* [[CBS News]]
* [[NBC News]]
* [[Cable News Network|CNN]]
* [[Fox News|Fox]]
* The [[Associated Press]]

ABC News scooped its partners all night in reporting outcomes of the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 US elections]] when it hired an outside firm to exit pooling and was able to make earlier calls with that data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=James|title=Election Night Heats Up - The Networks Race to Make the Calls|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/public-perspective/ppscan/81/81040.pdf|work=The Public Perspective|date=December 1996 – January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the 2000 presidential election==
A possibly unwritten secondary mission of the Voter News Service was to provide election results as quickly as possible on election night&amp;mdash;a point which came to haunt the VNS in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].

===Election Night in Florida===
The VNS received intense criticism for its 'flip-flop' calling of the state of [[Florida]] in that election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barringer|first1=Felicity|title=CBS Plans Changes in Election Night Reporting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/05/us/cbs-plans-changes-in-election-night-reporting.html|work=The New York Times|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the evening, it first called the closely contested state of Florida for [[Al Gore]], then [[George W. Bush]], and then as 'too close to call'. Critics argued that the state should never have been called until the state's fate was clear. The Voter News Service also received specific criticism for calling the state of Florida for Al Gore before the polls closed in the Florida panhandle, which was located in the [[Central Time Zone]] and heavily Republican.  In addition, criticism also came because of the call for Bush which occurred before precincts in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach]] [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]], and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade Counties]] reported their results to the state which occurred after the networks called the state for Bush well after 2 AM eastern standard time.

===Bush vs. Gore===
The next day it was discovered that 'bad data' resulted in the carnage of the previous night.  Due to the Bush margin of victory being less than 0.5% of the total number of votes cast, an automatic statewide machine recount was ordered.  In Palm Beach County, a [[butterfly ballot]] was used to conduct the election in some precincts. On election day, voters intended to vote for Al Gore instead voted for [[Pat Buchanan]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] ticket.  Buchanan received 3,407 votes or 0.8% of the total compared to 0.29% of the total statewide.  As a result, unwilling Buchanan voters in Palm Beach county reported votes for Gore in exit polling which resulted in flawed data. [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000#Palm Beach County.27s butterfly ballots|Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots]]

==2002 attempt and disbandment==
In 2002, the VNS intended to make calls in the [[United States elections, 2002|November 2002 U.S. Congressional and Senate elections]]. It attempted to use a computer system designed for VNS by [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] to do this. A system failure occurred in this computer on election night, making quick delivery of data impossible. In fact, collecting and delivering the data took ''ten months''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Bauder| date=September 5, 2003| title=VNS Data From '02 Midterm Votes Released| agency=[[Associated Press]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79260276.html| accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2003/&gt;

In January 2003, the Voter News Service was disbanded largely because of failures in 2000 and 2002. Murray Edelman, VNS editorial director, criticized the decision as making the VNS a scapegoat.&lt;ref name=WaPo2003&gt;{{cite news| first=Richard| last=Morin| date=January 14, 2003| title=Networks To Dissolve Exit Poll Service| newspaper=Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A51692-2003Jan13?language+printer| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804221517/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A51692-2003Jan13?language+printer|archivedate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004==
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], a new organization called [[National Election Pool]] was set up by the same organizations, utilizing consultants Edison/Mitofsky for exit polling and Associated Press for official returns. However, the NEP had controversies of its own for 2004 when it released exit polling data early that was significantly different than the final results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">The '''WGA script registration service''' is a service run by both the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE) and the [[Writers Guild of America West]] (WGAW) to establish the date of creation of [[literary property]], typically a motion picture screenplay, useful in the often-contentious U.S. entertainment field. 

The service supports the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] but is also available for non-members to use.  This is one of the distinctions that makes the WGAE and WGAw true [[guild]]s and not simply a [[trade union]] bargaining for existing members.

Registration with the Guilds has become important in [[lawsuit]]s for [[copyright infringement]] especially where the degree of copying is very loose or vague or conceptual:  invoking the Guilds itself as registrar indicates that the Guilds' standard concept of property rights in literary works were expected to be followed by at least the registrant.

Although registration is an important part of assisting in protecting a writer's rights to his or her work and determining compensation, registration is not the same as a US Copyright.  Although a registration may constitute evidence in a copyright dispute, registration is not proof of copyright registration or ownership. Additionally, an official Copyright registration with the U.S. Library of Congress is required to invoke the jurisdiction of U.S. Federal Courts, where most copyright infringement claims are adjudicated.
