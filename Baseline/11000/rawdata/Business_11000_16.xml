[[Image:American Ambulance Association Logo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AAA logo]]
'''The [[United States|American]] [[Ambulance]] Association''' ('''AAA''') is a [[trade association]] for the [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] industry. The AAA is based in [[McLean, Virginia]] and was founded in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ambulance.org/our-mission/ |title=American Ambulance Association: Our Mission |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA's website states that its mission is "to promote health care policies that ensure excellence in the ambulance services industry and provide research, education and communications programs to enable its members to effectively address the needs of the communities they serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ambulance.org/our-mission/ |title=American Ambulance Association: Our Mission |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this mission, the AAA manages the "Stars of Life" program, an annual awards program that recognizes "ambulance professionals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to their communities or the EMS profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stars.ambulance.org/ |title=Stars of Life 2018: American Ambulance Association |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the AAA issued its first recommendations for diversity and intercultural communication, noting that the primarily white, male, English-speaking EMS workforce underserved some population sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/nyregion/a-brooklyn-ambulance-service-speaks-chinese-like-its-patients.html |title=A Brooklyn Ambulance Service Speaks Chinese, Like Its Patients |last=Nir |first=Sarah Maslin |date=May 23, 2016 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=In New York and around the country, emergency responders have historically been white and male, said Scott Moore, a human resources and operations consultant with the American Ambulance Association, a national trade organization, and an emergency medical technician for 26 years. Beyond translating words, Mr. Moore said, a diverse emergency response fleet can add cultural competency to how their work is done … Last year, Mr. Moore’s organization issued its first handbook for intercultural communication. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA holds an annual conference and awards dinner, where it gives annual awards such as the Patient and Employee Safety award to ambulance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scottsdaleindependent.com/news/scottsdale-ambulance-technology-receives-national-ems-safety-award/|title=Scottsdale ambulance technology receives national EMS safety award|date=2018-08-28|work=Scottsdale Independent|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another award is the Star of Life award. In March 2017, an ambulance was hit by a Jeep Cherokee in Mississippi, nearly killing a paramedic. Paramedic Jimmy Miller was awarded the AAA Star of Life award for outstanding service after surviving the wreck, which should have killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2018/08/08/wreck-nearly-kills-paramedic-who-earns-national-award-valor/872018002/|title=AMR paramedic survives near-fatal wreck, receives national award for valor|work=The Clarion Ledger|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anastasios George Leventis''' ({{lang-el|Αναστάσιος Γ. Λεβέντης}}; December 1902 – October 25, 1978) was a [[Greek Cypriot]] businessman who founded a major merchandise trading firm, A.G. Leventis (Nigeria) Plc, in West Africa. A dominant figure in the economy of many West African countries and especially [[Nigeria]], he was awarded the title of Babalaje of Egbaland by Alake [[Ladapo Ademola]].

His daughter Fotini married politician [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], who eventually became President of Cyprus.

==Early life==
Leventis was born in the village of [[Lemithou|Lemythou]], [[Limassol District]], in the [[Troodos Mountains]]. His father was a minister of the Greek Orthodox Church and was also a schoolmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supplement on A.G. Leventis|work=New Nigerian|date=December 19, 1978|ref=newnigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;Leventis attended Mitsis Commercial School. At the age of 16, he traveled to France to look for employment and educational opportunities. In 1920, he took up a job opportunity in Nigeria working at a trading post in Nwaniba, along the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]].

==Career==
In 1922, Leventis joined the firm of A.J. Tangalakis in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He developed most of his connections with Nigeria while working in the city. When his firm merged with G.B. Ollivant, Leventis stayed with amalgamated entity and rose to become the general manager of [[G. B. Ollivant]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agleventis.com/agleventis.shtml |title=Leventis Biography |accessdate=2007-04-26 |publisher=AG Leventis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830010255/http://www.agleventis.com/agleventis.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he left the firm after it was acquired by [[United Africa Company]].  Leventis then formed his own company and started out as a produce buyer, partly financed by some British cotton manufacturers. Leventis was assisted in the new venture by his brother C.P. Leventis, who organized the Nigerian branch in 1942 and a friend, G.E. Keralakis. In Ghana, Leventis was sympathetic to the cause of African nationalists. He was a friend of [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[J.B. Danquah]]. When a riot flared up in the country, many foreign stores were burnt and closed only Leventis owned stores untouched and open throughout the conflict period. He was made Ghanaian ambassador to France when Nkrumah was elected president of Ghana.

In the 1940s, the firm faced business challenges, UK authorities imposed a country by country quota on cotton imported from Africa, which was intended to influence textile and [[oil seed]] production in West Africa, and after the end of World War II, there were supply shortages. The former situation created the impetus for A.G. Leventis to establish a branch in [[Nigeria]], called [[A.G. Leventis Nigeria Plc]]. Within a few years the Nigerian company expanded its business line from cotton exports to merchandise trading and secured new sources of supplies.  In the late 1940s, the firm changed its strategy motivated by diversification and modernization. In 1960, Leventis Group speedily completed the [[Federal Palace Hotel]] at the request of the Nigerian government, the hotel served as accommodation for guests expected during Nigeria's independence celebration. By the 1960s his firm had grown to become one of the largest distributors in Nigeria and one of the largest merchandise traders in the West African region.  In Nigeria, he re-structured the business from general trading into a specialized trading firm and established various department stores. During this period, he thrived as a result of the nation's relatively open economy, as it was not until the 1970s that [[economic nationalism]] became a dominant initiative.  His marketing style made the Leventis name familiar to many customers in Nigeria. Apart from his sympathy for the nationalist movement in Africa, he also gave his support to his native country's independence movement. He developed a friendship with Arch-Bishop [[Makarios III]] who appointed him Cyprus' ambassador to UNESCO and awarded him the medal of St. Barnabas. 

==Philanthropy==
After his death in 1978, the A.G. Leventis Foundation was established in 1979. It has a primary focus on the cultural heritage of Cyprus and Greece, especially reflected in its collections of Cypriot antiquities displayed in several museums around the world, its restoration of cultural monuments, and its sponsorship of scholarships for postgraduate work in several fields including archaeology and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/education/foundation-awards-scholarships-to-27-post-graduates--67940|title=Foundation awards scholarships to 27 post-graduates|date=November 30, 2013|work=Ghana News Agency|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also sponsors work in the areas of environmental protection and medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leventisfoundation.org/en/|title=Welcome|work=A.G. Leventis Foundation|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the A.G. Leventis Gallery was opened in the [[British Museum]], to display Cypriot antiquities from the early Bronze Age to the Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arapoglu|first=Evita|title=The A.G. Leventis Collection : 19th-20th century Greek paintings : 4-30 November 1994.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ag-leventis-collection-19th-20th-century-greek-paintings-4-30-november-1994/oclc/078241324|year=1994|publisher=Hellenic Center|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, a similar display was opened at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], and in 2000 another at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

In 2008 the A.G. Leventis Foundation endowed a new [[chair (academic)|chair]] at [[Cambridge University]] in [[Greek culture]]—the [[A. G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/new-chair-in-ancient-greek-culture-established|title=New chair in Ancient Greek culture established|date=October 7, 2008|work=University of Cambridge News|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
The earliest records of his family go back to the 18th Century when a young ancestor had traveled to the Peloponnese to join the abortive 1770 uprising against Ottoman rule (known to history as the ‘Orlov’ rebellion). By the time of his birth, his family counted a number of distinguished clerics who served at the highest levels — metropolitan bishops, patriarchs from the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem and [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], as well as from the [[Church of Cyprus]].

Born in December 1902 in Lemythou, Cyprus to Neoklis/Papaneoklis Leventis and Salome Theocharides, he had several brothers and sisters: Costas; George, who firstly went to Egypt; Kalliopi, mother of film producer [[Alki David]]; Evagoras; Katerina, who wed Mr Myrianthousis; Charalambos; Anastasios; Christodoulos; and David.

He married Maria Fotini, with whom he had a child, Papadopoulos Leventis.

He is also uncle to Constantine (Dino) Leventis (1938–2002), businessman and major art benefactor of Hellenic art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other museums around the world: in April 2000, the Metropolitan Museum opened the A.G. Leventis Foundation Gallery where the museum's collection of Cypriot sculpture, terracottas, vases, jewelry and coins from the fifth and fourth centuries BC are displayed. The foundation also helped pay for similar galleries devoted to ancient Greek and Cypriot art in the British Museum, the Louvre in Paris and the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, among others, according to its latest annual report. In Greece, it has financed extensive archeological work.

'''Licensing''' means renting or leasing of an [[intangible asset]]. It is a process of creating and managing [[contracts]] between the owner of a [[brand]] and a company or individual who wants to  use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a [[trademark]] or character onto products of a completely different nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Integrated Intellectual Asset Management|first= Steve|last= Manton|year=2005|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-566-08721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of intangible assets include a song ("Somewhere Over The Rainbow"), a character ([[Donald Duck]]), a name ([[Michael Jordan]]), or a brand (The [[Ritz-Carlton]]). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).&lt;ref name="Brand Licensing Expert"&gt;[http://www.brandlicensingexpert.com BrandLicensingExpert.com Peter Canalichio, Licensing Brands, Inc. CEO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of [[patent]]s and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.

This process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. [[McDonald's]] play food, [[Burger King]] T-shirts and even ghastly [[Good Humor]] Halloween costumes became commonplace. [[Brand extension]]s later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to ''rent'' the product of an established brand name. [[Armor All]] auto vacuums, [[Breyers]] yogurt, [[TGI Friday's]] frozen appetizers, and [[Lucite]] nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.

== Reasons for licensing ==
A company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for [[brand extensions]] or products. For example, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a [[licensee]] make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded "Earbud Headphones", "iPod docking stations" and "iPod socks." Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.

Apart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their [[merchandise]], but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:

* Licensor chooses the product categories to be licensed   
* Licensor finds and negotiates a license with the best licensees   
* Licensees develop concepts, prototypes and final production samples and submit for approval   
* Licensor approves licensed products for sale   
* Licensees sell licensed products to authorized retailers&lt;ref name="Marketing Professors"&gt;[http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/971/pete-canalichio MarketingProfessors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. [[Royalties]] are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.&lt;ref name="Atlanta Business Radio"&gt;[http://atlantabusinessradio.businessradiox.com/atlanta-business-radio-interviews-swine-flu-expert-dr-elaina-george-brand-licensing-expert-pete-canalichio-and-batteries-plus-owner-john-cyphers/ Atlanta Business Radio Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global brand licensing industry ==

The main international [[professional association]] for brand licensing is the [[Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association]], which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.

The Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence  (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing. The mission of SPLiCE is to act as a community of licensors who share best practices for protecting, promoting and enhancing brand integrity. The SPLiCE Licensors Workshop acts as its annual board of directors and members' meeting. During SPLiCE Licensors Workshop, benchmark findings and industry trends are highlighted in feature panel presentations that are relevant to the community at large. They engage a creativity philosophy of divergence and convergence to sustain unique idea implementation on best practices. The vision for SPLiCE Licensors Workshop is to provide best in practice licensing education through sharing educational best practices through benchmarking initiatives, task force collaborations, committee reports, and guest industry speakers

Each May, ''License! Global'' magazine publishes an annual list of "The Top 150 Global Licensors". For 2017, the leader was [[Disney Consumer Products]] with $53 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by [[Meredith Corp.]] with $23.2 Billion and [[PVH (company)|PVH]] with $18 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Top 150 Global Licensors|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA), global licensed merchandise sales was $272.2 billion in 2016, versus $262.2 billion in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Michael |last2=Ames |first2=Allison |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/licensing-expo-2017-8-trends-263-billion-industry/309209/ |title=8 Trends Ahead for the $263 Billion Licensing Industry |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=2017-06-01 |accessdate=2017-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brand licensing in India ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. [[Arvind_(company)| Arvind]] represent Arrow, Cherokee, ELLE, Nautica, USPA, AEROPOSTALE, CHILDRENS PLACE, Ed Hardy, GAP and Kipling. The [[Murjani Group]] is the licensee for Calvin Klein Jeans, FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail. 

Character Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are [[Disney India]], [[Viacom 18]] and [[Cartoon Network Enterprises]]. Characters licensed out by Disney India include [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. Viacom has brought in popular characters from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] like [[Dora The Explorer]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]. Cartoon Network boasts of a portfolio including characters such as [[Ben 10]], [[Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mr. Bean]], [[Roll no. 21]], [[We Bare Bears]].

== Brand licensing in Italy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Brand Licensing in [[Italy]] started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as [[He-Man]] and the Masters of the Universe, [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Hanna &amp; Barbera]] characters, [[Zorro]], [[Asterix]] and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.

'''CVS Ferrari''' dates back to the 1940s, when it was previously known as THE FERRARI BELOTTI S.p.A. Belotti was the first [[company]] to design and build [[mobile handling equipment]] specifically for ports from their manufacturing facility on "[[Ponte Canepa]]" wharf.

In July 2002 CVS bought Belotti.

==The Belotti days==
In 1952 Belotti manufactured the first crane able to lift and transport military aircraft. In 1967 Belotti introduced the first container handling straddle carrier with side lifting capability.

The first 100-tonne capacity aircraft transporter was supplied in 1967. Belotti later delivered machines to armed forces worldwide. Belotti ultimately supplied over 1,200 machines worldwide.

==History==
1973 – The company is founded by Lorenzo, Giuseppe &amp; Luciano Ferrari as manufacturer of crane carriers and special vehicles

1982 – [[Shunt truck|Terminal and ro-ro tractors]] are manufactured

1993 – First family of [[reachstacker]] model Ferrari 100 are launched

1997 – The second [[generation]] of reach stackers model Ferrari 200 is introduced in the market

2001 – [[Business alliance|Alliances]] with Taylor and Komatsu are signed to become global manufacturer of reach stackers

2002 – Acquisition of the Belotti

2004 – Acquisition of the Papalini company (ex Kalmar dealer for Italy) to create CVS Service

'''Carpigiani''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] company, located near [[Bologna]], specialising in the production of [[ice cream]] making machines.  It claims control of about half of the world market for ice cream machines, including machines both for Italian-style [[gelato]] and soft ice cream.&lt;ref name="sweet"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167665059.html "...and a sweet success; Italian champions (2).(A thriving producer of ice-cream churns)"] ''[[The Economist]]'', August 18, 2007 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothers Bruto and Poerio Carlo Carpigiani created the "Gastecnica S.a.s dei fratelli Carpigiani" in 1944. Carpigiani produced and patented a gelato machine, named "Autogelatiera". The Carpigiani soft serve ice cream machines make a fluffy, whippy ice cream due to their clever whipping action, mixing air and ice cream mix, during the ice cream making process.

The technological growth in the 1960s brought Carpigiani to become the worldwide leader in the ice cream machinery, with the invention of the "hard-o-matic".

In 1964 an American secondary company was founded with the name Coldelite U.S.A., in 1971 Carpigiani bought Cattabriga (concurrent firm), in 1989 the Comenda Ali [[Corporation#Italy|S.p.A.]] group bought the Carpigiani Bruto S.p.A.
In 1993 Carpagiani was certified [[Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione|UNI]] EN [[ISO 9001]]:1987. It was the first company in the business to receive this certification.&lt;ref name="sweet"/&gt;

In 2003 Carpigiani established [[Gelato University]] as a school to teach about artisan gelato making using Carpigiani products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21569422-ivory-towers-ice-cream-scoop Gelato University: Scoop! The ivory towers of ice cream].  ''[[The Economist]]'', January 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Jennings, [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/23/food/la-fo-gelato-20100923 "The inside scoop on making gelato: Italy's Carpigiani Gelato University teaches its students, who hail from all over the globe, how to craft the creamy dessert from simple, fresh ingredients in a few steps."]  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Carpigiani is present in the markets of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, Ethiopia and Australia.

'''Contract failure''' describes a situation in which the consumer of a good or service is unable to evaluate its quality, thus incentivizing the producer to produce a lower quality good or service.&lt;ref name="(W.)Steinberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Powell (W.)|author2=Richard Steinberg|title=The nonprofit sector: a research handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ligvL-cLFIEC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10903-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such behavior creates suboptimal economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Benson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Benson|title=The Theory of Contract Law: New Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GSf6QGASEoC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=5 February 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64038-1|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contract failure is one explanation for the existence of [[non-profit organization]]s,&lt;ref name="Anheier2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmut K.

== Information Asymmetry ==
The known cause of contract failure is called [[information asymmetry]]; when one party (the producer) has more information than the other party (the consumer) about a product or service.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=D|title=Contract Failure. In The Nature of the Nonprofit Sector|date=1998|publisher=West View|location=Philadelphia|pages=154–157|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is information inequality between the two parties.&lt;ref name=Arrow&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrow|first1=J.K.|title=Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care.|journal=The American Economic Review|date=1963|pages=941–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Young, there are three causes in which situations dealing with asymmetric information arise from, to include the following, 1) the quality of a product or service is too complex to be judged such as medical care or higher education; 2) the end consumer of the product or service cannot evaluate it him or herself such as a child in daycare or an elderly individual in a nursing home; and 3) the product or service is not consumed by the individual who purchased it, therefore the purchaser would never know if the producer delivered what was promised.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

== Nonprofit Existence ==
When contract failure occurs, there is a suboptimal provision of public goods, which results in market failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisbrod|first1=B.A.|title=Economics of Institutional Choice|journal=Working Paper|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow argues that nonprofits will step in and provide the necessary good or service in response to market failure.&lt;ref name="Arrow"/&gt; When markets potentially take advantage of the information asymmetry situation, nonprofits must protect the consumer.&lt;ref name=ihlan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ihlan|first1=H.|title=Nonprofit Organizations as Providers of Public Goods.|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Economics|date=2013|volume=20|issue=1|pages=95–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Distribution Constraint ==
According to Hansmann, the “non-distribution constraint - prohibits the distribution of residual earnings to individuals who exercise control over the firm”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansmann|first1=H.B.|title=The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise.|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1980|volume=5|page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prohibits those who have a vested interest in the organization from receiving the organization’s profit for personal gain. This constraint is a common characteristic of nonprofits, which creates less of an incentive for the organization to take advantage of the consumer’s lack of knowledge. The nonprofit has no reason to cheat the consumer out of quality or service delivery because the organization's individuals cannot benefit directly. Therefore, the consumer is more likely to trust a nonprofit organization providing services than to trust a for-profit organization because of the nonprofit’s non-distribution constraint.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; According to Easley and O'Hara, state law stipulates that the organizations day-to-day costs should be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easley|first1=D.|last2=O'Hara|first2=M.|title=The Economic Role of the Nonprofit Firm|journal=The Bell Journal of Economics|date=1983|pages=531–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture jamming''' (sometimes [[guerrilla communication]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w0TSfW4MU4QC&amp;pg=PA274 ''Images of the street: planning, identity, and control in public space''] By Nicholas R. Fyfe, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Grindon [https://books.google.com/books?id=U4fpAAAAMAAJ ''Aesthetics and Radical Politics'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a tactic used by many [[anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] [[social movement]]s&lt;ref name="Binay"&gt;"Investigating the Anti-consumerism Movement in North America: The Case of Adbusters';" Binay, Ayse; (2005); dissertation, University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt; to disrupt or subvert [[media culture]] and its [[mainstream]] cultural institutions, including corporate advertising.  It attempts to "expose the methods of domination" of a [[mass society]] to foster [[Progressivism|progressive]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5 p. 5 ''Culture Jamming: Ideological Struggle and the Possibilities for Social Change'' ]; 2008; Nomai, Afsheen Joseph&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture jamming is a form of [[subvertising]].&lt;ref name="Cortese2008"&gt;{{cite book | author=Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese| title=Provocateur: Images of Women and Minorities in Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6pO6kUa9w0C&amp;pg=PA22| accessdate=3 December 2012|year=2008| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn=978-0-7425-5539-6| page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many ''culture jams'' are intended to expose questionable political assumptions behind commercial culture. Culture jamming makes use of the technique ''[[détournement]]'', which uses the language and rhetoric of the mainstream paradigm or culture to subversively critique the paradigm or culture. Tactics include re-figuring logos, fashion statements, and product images as a means to challenge the idea of "what's cool".&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;Boden, Sharon and Williams, Simon J. (2002) "Consumption and Emotion: The Romantic Ethic Revisited", Sociology 36(3):493–512&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture jamming often entails using [[mass media]] to produce ironic or [[satirical]] commentary about itself, commonly using the original medium's communication method.

Culture jamming is employed as a reaction against social [[conformity]].  Prominent examples of culture jamming include the adulteration of billboard advertising by the [[Billboard Liberation Front]] (BLF), and [[List of contemporary artists#E|contemporary artists]] such as [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]].  Culture jamming may involve street parties and protests.  While culture jamming usually focuses on subverting or critiquing political and advertising messages, some proponents focus on a more positive (often musically inspired) form which brings together artists, scholars, and activists to create new types of cultural production that transcend – rather than merely criticize – the status quo.&lt;ref name="LeVine"&gt;LeVine, Mark (2005)'' Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil''. Oxford, UK: Oneworld Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture Jam Pedagogy and Practice: Relocating Culture by Staying on One's Toes|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cccr.12090/abstract|journal = Communication, Culture &amp; Critique|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1753-9137|pages = 395–413|volume = 8|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/cccr.12090|first = Tema|last = Milstein|first2 = Alexis|last2 = Pulos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term, etymology, and history==

===1984 coinage===
The term was coined in 1984 by [[Don Joyce (musician)|Don Joyce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?p=696 |title=Don Joyce (2/9/44 – 7/22/15) |publisher=Negativland}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[sound collage]] band [[Negativland]], with the release of their album ''[[JamCon '84]]''.&lt;ref name="Lloyd03"&gt;Lloyd, Jan (2003) [http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/cult/research/lloyd.htm ''Culture Jamming: Semiotic Banditry in the Streets''], in ''Cultural Studies Department'': University of Canterbury,
Christchurc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dery2010Revisited"&gt;Dery, Mark (2010) New Introduction and revisited edition of [http://markdery.com/?page_id=154 ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs]'', October 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "culture jamming" comes from the idea of [[radio jamming]]:&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt; that public frequencies can be pirated and subverted for independent communication, or to disrupt dominant frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://disruptdominantfrequencies.net/ Disrupt Dominant Frequencies]&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the tracks of the album, they stated:&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt;

{{quotation|As awareness of how the media environment we occupy affects and directs our inner life grows, some resist. The skillfully reworked billboard... directs the public viewer to a consideration of the original corporate strategy. The studio for the cultural jammer is the world at large.}}

===Origins and preceding influences===
According to [[Vince Carducci]], although the term was coined by Negativland, culture jamming can be traced as far back as the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Carducci"&gt;[[Vince Carducci|Carducci, Vince]] (2006) "Culture Jamming: A Sociological Perspective", Journal of Consumer Culture 6(1): 116–138&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly influential group that was active in Europe was the [[Situationist International]] and was led by [[Guy Debord]]. The SI asserted that in the past humans dealt with life and the consumer market directly. They argued that this spontaneous way of life was slowly deteriorating as a direct result of the new "modern" way of life. Situationists saw everything from television to radio as a threat &lt;ref name ="Lasn"&gt;Lasn, Kalle (1999) Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge – And Why We Must. New York: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that life in industrialized areas, driven by capitalist forces, had become monotonous, sterile, gloomy, linear, and productivity driven. In particular, the SI argued humans had become passive recipients of ''the'' ''[[The Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]]'',  a simulated reality that generates the desire to consume, and positions humans as obedient consumerist cogs within the efficient and exploitative productivity loop of capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Society of the spectacle|last = Debord|first = Guy|publisher = Black and Red|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Detroit|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through playful activity, individuals could create ''[[Situationist prank|situations]]'', the opposite of spectacles.  For the SI, these situations took the form of the ''[[dérive]]'', or the active drift of the body through space in ways that broke routine and overcame boundaries, creating situations by exiting habit and entering new interactive possibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] traces the origins of culture jamming to medieval carnival, which [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] interpreted, in ''Rabelais and his World,'' as an officially sanctioned subversion of the social hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Modern precursors might include: the media-savvy agit-prop of the anti-Nazi photomonteur [[John Heartfield]], the sociopolitical street theater and staged media events of 1960s radicals such as [[Abbie Hoffman]], the [[Germany|German]] concept of [[Spaßguerilla]], and in the [[Situationist International]] (SI) of the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The SI first compared its own activities to [[radio jamming]] in 1968, when it proposed the use of [[guerrilla communication]] within [[mass media]] to sow confusion within the dominant culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1985, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] formed to expose discrimination and corruption in the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://markdery.com:?page_id=154 Mark Dery."A Brief Introduction to the 2010 Reprint (open source)." ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of Signs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Dery's ''[[New York Times]]'' article on culture jamming, "The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax"&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"&gt;[[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] (1990)[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DF123EF930A15751C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all ''The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax''], NYtimes article, December 23, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first mention, in the mainstream media, of the phenomenon; Dery later expanded on this article in his 1993 Open Magazine pamphlet, ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs'',&lt;ref name="Dery93OpenMag"&gt;Dery, Mark (1993) [http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/culture_jamming.html ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs]'', in ''Open Magazine Pamphlet Series'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; a seminal essay that remains the most exhaustive historical, sociopolitical, and philosophical theorization of culture jamming to date. ''[[Adbusters]]'', a Canadian publication espousing an environmentalist critique of consumerism and advertising, began promoting aspects of culture jamming after Dery introduced founder and editor [[Kalle Lasn]] to the term through a series of articles he wrote for the magazine. In her critique of consumerism, ''[[No Logo]]'', the Canadian cultural commentator and political activist [[Naomi Klein]] examines culture jamming in a chapter which focuses on the work of [[Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada]]. Through an analysis of the [[Where the Hell is Matt?|Where the Hell is Matt]] viral videos, researchers Milstein and Pulos analyze how the power of the culture jam to disrupt the status quo is currently being threatened by increasing commercial incorporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, T-Mobile utilized the Liverpool street underground station to host a flashmob to sell their mobile services.

[[File:Vorsprung durch Graffit cropped.jpg|thumb|240px|Graffitied text on billboard in [[Cambridge]], [[UK]]]][[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating culture jamming through musical icons]]
Culture jamming is a form of disruption that plays on the [[emotions]] of viewers and bystanders. Jammers want to disrupt the unconscious thought process that takes place when most consumers view a popular advertising and bring about a [[détournement]].&lt;ref name="Lasn"/&gt; Activists that utilize this tactic are counting on their [[meme]] to pull on the emotional strings of people and evoke some type of reaction. The reactions that most cultural jammers are hoping to evoke are behavioral change and political action. There are four [[emotion]]s that activists often want viewers to feel. These emotions – [[shock value|shock]], [[shame]], [[fear]], and [[anger]] – are believed to be the catalysts for social change.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;Summers-Effler, Erika (2002) "The Micro Potential for Social Change: Emotion, Consciousness, and Social Movement Formation", Sociological Theory 20(1): 41–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic unit in which a message is transmitted in culture jamming is the [[meme]]. Memes are condensed images that stimulate visual, verbal, musical, or behavioral associations that people can easily imitate and transmit to others. The term meme was coined and first popularized by geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]], but later used by cultural critics such as [[Douglas Rushkoff]], who claimed memes were a type of [[media virus]].&lt;ref name="Rushkoff"&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas (1996) Media Virus! New York: Ballantine&lt;/ref&gt; Memes are seen as [[genes]] that can jump from outlet to outlet and replicate themselves or mutate upon transmission just like a virus.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1989) The Selfish Gene. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Culture jammers will often use common symbols such as the McDonald's golden arches or Nike swoosh to engage people and force them to think about their eating habits or fashion sense.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/ccce/polcommcampaigns/CultureJamming.htm Center for Communication and Civic Engagement], [[Seattle, Washington]] Retrieved November 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, jammer [[Jonah Peretti]] used the Nike symbol to stir debate on sweatshop child labor and consumer freedom. Peretti made public exchanges between himself and Nike over a disagreement. Peretti had requested custom Nikes with the word "sweatshop" placed in the Nike symbol. Nike refused. Once this story was made public over Peretti's website, it spread worldwide and contributed to the already robust conversation&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/how-nike-solved-its-sweatshop-problem-2013-5?op=1], [[Business Insider]] Retrieved February 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and dialogue about Nike's use of sweatshops,&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; which had been ongoing for a decade prior to Peretti's 2001 stunt. Jammers can also organize and participate in mass campaigns. Examples of cultural jamming like Perretti's are more along the lines of tactics that radical consumer social movements would use. These movements push people to question the taken-for-granted assumption that consuming is natural and good and aim to disrupt the naturalization of consumer culture; they also seek to create systems of production and consumption that are more humane and less dominated by global corporate [[Late capitalism|hypercapitalism]].&lt;ref name = "Princen"&gt;Princen, Thomas, Maniates, Michael and Conca, Ken (2002) Confronting Consumption. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Past mass events and ideas have included "Buy Nothing Day", "Digital Detox Week", virtual sit-ins and protests over the Internet, producing ‘subvertisements' and placing them in public spaces, and creating and enacting ‘placejamming' projects
where public spaces are reclaimed and nature is re-introduced into urban
places.&lt;ref name= "harold"&gt;Harold, Christine (2004) `Pranking Rhetoric: "Culture jamming" as Media Activism', Critical Studies in Media Communication 21(3): 189–211&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective form of jamming is to use an already widely recognizable meme to transmit the message. Once viewers are forced to take a second look at the mimicked popular meme they are forced out of their comfort zone. Viewers are presented with another way to view the meme and forced to think about the implications presented by the jammer.&lt;ref name="Lasn"/&gt; More often than not, when this is used as a tactic the jammer is going for shock value. For example, to make consumers aware of the negative body image that big-name fashion brands are frequently accused of causing, a subvertisement of Calvin Klein's 'Obsession' was created and played worldwide. It depicted a young woman with an eating disorder throwing up into a toilet.&lt;ref name="Bordwell"&gt;Bordwell, Marilyn (2002) `Jamming Culture: Adbusters' Hip Media Campaign against Consumerism', in Thomas Princen, Michael Maniates and Ken Conca (eds) Confronting Consumption, pp. 237–53. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that social consumer movements hope to utilize culture jamming effectively is by employing a metameme. A metameme is a two-level message that punctures a specific commercial image, but does so in a way that challenges some larger aspect of the political culture of corporate domination.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; An example would be the "true cost" campaign set in motion by Adbusters. "True Cost" forced consumers to compare the human labor cost and conditions and environmental drawbacks of products to the sales costs. Another example would be the "Truth" campaigns that frequented television in the past years that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products.

Following critical scholars like [[Paulo Freire]], Culture jams are also being Integrated into the university classroom "setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique, but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisments to engage with [[media literacy]] projects.

==Criticism==
Culture jamming is sometimes confused with [[Appropriation (art)|artistic appropriation]] or with acts of [[vandalism]] which have destruction or defacement as their primary goal.  Although the end result is not always easily distinguishable from these activities, the intent of those participating in culture jamming differs from that of people whose intent is either artistic or merely destructive.  The lines are not always clear-cut; some activities, notably [[street art]], will fall into two or even all three categories.

Recently there have been arguments against the validity and effectiveness of culture jamming. Some argue that culture jamming is easily co-opted and commodified by the market, which tends to "defuse" its potential for consumer resistance.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Rumbo, Joseph D. (2002) "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology &amp; Marketing 19(2): 127–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Others posit that the culture jamming strategy of rhetorical sabotage, used by Adbusters, is easily incorporated and appropriated by clever advertising agencies, and thus is not a very powerful means of social change.&lt;ref name="harold"/&gt; Yet other critics argue that without moving beyond mere critique to offering an alternative economic, social, cultural and/or political vision, jams quickly lose their power and resonance.&lt;ref name="LeVine" /&gt;

'''DASH7 Alliance Protocol''' ('''D7A''') is an open source Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network protocol, which operates in the 433&amp;nbsp;MHz, 868&amp;nbsp;MHz and 915&amp;nbsp;MHz unlicensed [[ISM band]]/SRD band. DASH7 provides multi-year [[battery (electricity)#Battery lifetime|battery life]], range of up to 2&amp;nbsp;km, low latency for connecting with moving things, a very small open source [[protocol stack]], AES 128-bit shared key encryption support, and data transfer of up to 167 kbit/s. The DASH7 Alliance Protocol is the name of the technology promoted by the non-profit consortium called the [[DASH7 Alliance]].

== International standard ==
DASH7 Alliance Protocol originates from the [[ISO/IEC 18000-7]] standard describing a 433&amp;nbsp;MHz [[ISM band]] air interface for active RFID. This standard was mainly used for military logistics.

The DASH7 Alliance re-purposed the original 18000-7 technology in 2011 and made it evolve toward a wireless sensor network technology for commercial applications. The DASH7 Alliance Protocol covers all Sub-GHz ISM bands making it available globally. The name of the new protocol was derived from the section seven denoted as -7 (/'dæʃ 'sevən/) of the original standard document.

The current version of the DASH7 Alliance protocol is no more compliant with the ISO/IEC 18000-7 standard.

=== History ===
In January 2009, the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] announced the largest RFID award in history, a $429 million contract for DASH7 devices, to four prime contractors: [[Savi Technology]], [[Northrop Grumman Information Technology]], [[Unisys]] and [[Systems &amp; Processes Engineering Corp. (SPEC)]].&lt;ref name="Bacheldor"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[DASH7 Alliance]], a non-profit industry consortium to promote interoperability among DASH7-compliant devices, was announced, and as of July 2010 has more than fifty participants in twenty-three countries.  Similar to what the [[WiFi]] Alliance does for [[IEEE 802.11]], the [http://www.dash7-allliance.org DASH7 Alliance] is doing for the ISO 18000-7 standard for wireless sensor networking.

In April 2011, the [[DASH7 Alliance]] [http://www.aimglobal.org/members/news/templates/template.aspx?articleid=3753&amp;zoneid=45 announced] adoption of DASH7 Mode 2, a next-generation version of the ISO 18000-7 standard that makes better use of modern silicon to achieve faster throughput, multi-hop, lower latency, better security, sensor support, and a built-in query protocol.

In March 2012, the DASH7 Alliance [http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/9345/2 announced] it was making the DASH7 Mode 2 specification available to non-members on an open source basis.

In July 2013, the DASH7 Alliance announced the DASH7 Alliance Protocol Draft 0.2.

In May 2015, the DASH7 Alliance [http://www.dash7-alliance.org/?p=780 publicly released] the v1.0 of the DASH7 Alliance Protocol.

In January 2017, the DASH7 Alliance publicly released the v1.1 of the DASH7 Alliance Protocol. The version constitutes a major update of v1.0, in particular in the area of security and interoperability.

=== BLAST networking technology ===
Networks based on DASH7 differ from typical wire-line and wireless networks utilizing a "session".  DASH7 networks serves applications in which low power usage is essential, and data transmission is typically much slower and/or sporadic, like basic [[telemetry]]. Thus instead of replicating a wire-line "session", DASH7 was designed with the concept of '''B.L.A.S.T.''':
* '''B'''ursty: Data transfer is abrupt and does not include content such as video, audio, or other isochronous forms of data.
* '''L'''ight: For most applications, packet sizes are limited to 256 bytes. Transmission of multiple, consecutive packets may occur but is generally avoided if possible.
* '''A'''synchronous: DASH7's main method of communication is by command-response, which by design requires no periodic network "hand-shaking" or synchronization between devices.
* '''S'''tealth: DASH7 devices does not need periodic beaconing to be able to respond in communication.
* '''T'''ransitive: A DASH7 system of devices is inherently mobile or transitional. Unlike other wireless technologies DASH7 is upload-centric, not download-centric, thus devices do not need to be managed extensively by fixed infrastructure (i.e. base stations).

=== Sub 1-Ghz ===
D7A utilizes the 433, 868 and 916&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283278207_DASH7_Alliance_Protocol_10_Low-Power_Mid-Range_Sensor_and_Actuator_Communication Research paper]&lt;/ref&gt;, which is globally available and license-free.

Sub 1-GHz is ideal for wireless [[sensor]] networking applications since it penetrates concrete and water, but also has the ability to transmit/receive over very long ranges without requiring a large power draw on a battery. The low input current of typical tag configurations allows for battery powering on coin cell or [[thin film]] batteries.

=== Tag-to-tag communications ===
Unlike most active [[RFID]] or [[LPWAN]] technologies, DASH7 supports tag-to-tag communications.

=== Localization ===
Localization techniques can be applied to DASH7 endpoints. An accuracy of 1m using DASH7 beacons at 433&amp;nbsp;MHz has been achieved in a lab experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrated query protocol ===
DASH7 supports a built-in query protocol that minimizes "round trips" for most messaging applications that results in lower latency and higher network throughput.

=== Range ===
DASH7 provides a link budget of up to 140 dB with 27 dBm transmission power, which positions the technology as Medium Range, compared to Short Range (Bluetooth, WiFi, ...) and Long Range (LoRaWAN, SigFox). Note that higher ranges are always obtained at the expense of per-bit power consumption and transmission duration. Low power long range technologies are generally not truly bi-directional as the regular scanning duty is pretty high. In this context, DASH7 is a very good compromise between range, power consumption, and bi-directionality and is very suitable for industrial applications with effective range of 100 m to 500 m.

In line-of-sight situations, DASH7 devices today advertise read ranges of 1 kilometer or more, however ranges of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km have been tested by [[Savi Technology]] and are easily achievable in the [[European Union]] where governmental regulations are less constrained than in the USA.

=== Interoperability ===
The DASH7 Alliance is currently working on a Certification program that tests functionally the DASH7 devices. The certification is composed of a set of test scenarios covering transactions in different stack configurations (channel, QoS, security). The physical wireless interface is not covered by the certification, and will have to comply to local radio regulations.

===Alternative Modulations===
The DASH7 Alliance policy does not allow to add proprietary or licensable modulation techniques in the official DASH7 Alliance Protocol. However, the layered structure of the protocol allows to easily integrate alternative modulations, such as LoRa, under the Network Layer (D7ANL). 

== Applications ==

=== Commercial applications ===
Similar to other networking technologies that began with defense sector (e.g. [[DARPA]] funding the Internet), DASH7 is similarly suited to a wide range of applications in development or being deployed including:

* '''[[Building Automation]], [[Access Control]], [[Smart meter|Smart Energy]] '''.  DASH7's signal propagation characteristics allow it to penetrate walls, windows, doors, and other substances that serve as impediments to other technologies operating at 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz, for example.  For smart energy and building automation applications, DASH7 networks can be deployed with far less infrastructure than competing technologies and at far lower total cost of ownership.
* '''[[Location-Based Services]]''' DASH7 is being used today for developing new location-based services using a range of DASH7-enabled devices including smartcards, keyfobs, tickets, watches and other conventional products that can take advantage of the unique small footprint, low power, long range, and low cost of DASH7 relative to less practical and high-power wireless technologies like WiFi or Bluetooth.

* '''[[Automotive]]''' DASH7 is increasingly seen as the next-generation [[tire pressure monitoring system]] given its operation at the same frequency (433&amp;nbsp;MHz) as nearly all proprietary TPMS systems today.  DASH7-based TPMS will provide end users with more accurate tire pressure readings, resulting in greater fuel economy, reduced tire wear and tear, and greater safety.  DASH7 products are also being designed and used for other automotive applications like [[supply chain]] visibility.
* '''[[Logistics]]''' DASH7 is being used today for tracking the whereabouts of shipping containers, pallets, roll cages, trucks, rail cars, maritime vessels, and other supply chain assets, providing businesses with unprecedented visibility into their everyday operations.  Also [[Cold chain|cold chain management]] (vaccines, fresh produce, cut flowers, etc.), whereby DASH7 is used for monitoring the in-transit temperature and other environmental factors that can impact the integrity of sensitive products.

== Developer support ==

=== OSS-7: Dash7 Open Source Stack ===

The goal of the project is to provide a reference implementation of the '''DASH7 Alliance protocol'''.&lt;ref name="DASH7 Alliance Protocol"&gt;{{Cite web
 | url = http://www.dash7-alliance.org/?page_id=20
 | title = DASH7 Alliance Protocol version 1.0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implementation should focus on completeness, correctness and being easy to understand. Performance and code size are less important aspects. For clarity a clear separation between the ISO layers is maintained in the code. The project is available on github [https://github.com/CoSys-Lab/dash7-ap-open-source-stack] and is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

=== OpenTag ===

'''DASH7 Mode 2''' developers benefit from the open source firmware library called [[OpenTag]], which provides developers with a "C"-based environment in which to develop DASH7 applications quickly.  So in addition to DASH7 (ISO 18000-7) being an open source, ISO standard, OpenTag is an open source stack that is quite unique relative to other wireless sensor networking (e.g. ZigBee) and active RFID (e.g. proprietary) options elsewhere in the marketplace today. Even though OpenTag is an Open Source project, people may not be able to use it free of charge. As of August 2015, there is no evidence to suggest OpenTag bears a royalty, although current versions of OpenTag [http://www.indigresso.com/wiki/doku.php?id=opentag:license OpenTag License] do include a provision permitting [[Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing|RAND]] licensing.

=== Semiconductor industry support ===
DASH7 developers receive support from the [[semiconductor]] industry including multiple options, with [[Texas Instruments]], [[ST Microelectronics]], [[Silicon Labs]], [[Semtech]]  and [[Analog Devices]] all offering DASH7 enabled hardware development kits or system-on-a-chip products.

=== Device integrators and Development Kits ===
Many companies are members of the [[DASH7 Alliance]] to produce DASH7-compliant hardware products:

'''Digital Data Systems''', or '''DDS''', was a leading solutions provider and consultancy firm specializing in [[operations support systems]] (OSS) and [[business support system]]s (BSS) in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) and carrier marketplace within the telecommunications industry. DDS was an independent provider of OSS and BSS during a time when such systems were provided by the large telecommunications switch vendors. It completed in OSS / BSS head-to-head against AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom (now Nortel Networks), and others in providing services that sold and deployed amongst the [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]], including: [[Bell Atlantic]], [[Southwestern Bell]], and [[Pacific Telesis]]. It had a hardware joint venture with [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS Computer Systems]] who provided the hardware platform upon which it ran. The business was acquired by [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) in 1992.

==Products and Services==
In addition to consulting services, the Company had two products: MATCH and DETECT.

===MATCH===
The Match product provided automated systems for telephone companies in [[Operations, administration and management]] (OA&amp;M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&amp;T 1AESS switches to newer digital switches, such as [[Northern Telecom]]'s [[DMS-100]] or [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[5ESS]] switches. The MATCH was composed of three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the [[AT&amp;T]] [[1AESS]], 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including [[COSMOS (telecommunications)|COSMOS]] and [[TIRKS]].  Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal [[database management system]], which was configurable based on job and customer preferences. The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system in line with the source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&amp;T 5AESS recent change messages and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new switching platform.

===DETECT===
The DETECT product utilized the Decoding and Matching modules of the MATCH product and brought in data records from [[RBOC]] [[telecommunications billing]] systems. Given the manual nature of service provisioning through the [[Recent change memory administration center|RCMAC]] at the time, many services were provisioned-but-unbilled by [[RBOC]]s. DETECT would identify provisioned-but-unbilled services and optionally generate the necessary machine instructions to recapture leaking revenue. The DETECT product detected over multi-million in revenue leakage often found in large centrex groups of multinational corporations.

'''Editorial-related advertising''' is associated with the concept of [[contextual advertising]] but differs in its ability to match [[advertising]] to content in a much more specific manner. Where contextual advertising is keyword based, editorial-related advertising is able to also take in the content of the whole article and match on a conceptual level, rather than simply looking for the existence of pre-selected words. For example, there is no chance that an auto mechanic could advertise next to an article about the [[Detroit Pistons]]. It has many different ways to go and one would be to not.

This specificity also ensures that:
* Advertisers do not advertise next to [[defamatory]] articles (or they can create content that will offer a [[right of reply]])
* Advertisers do not advertise next to inappropriate content such as [[obituaries]] or negative news articles
* Advertisers can appear next to articles in the general subject area of interest, for example for keywords that are not actually included in the on page text.

Advertisers can supply a number of specifically targeted pages, each with their own message to attract users to their '[[microsite]]'. This 'microsite' is housed within a publication on a searchable vertical directory. Advertisers who are not completely related to the publication will not be considered for the program. This creates a directory resource of related suppliers within the publication's website that is also [[search engine optimization|optimized]] for [[search engine]] traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Ethnic Business Awards''' is a [[business award]] held in [[Australia]] to recognize the achievement of migrant business owners. Held annually since 1988, they are Australia’s longest running business award on television. 

Founded in 1988 by [[Joseph Assaf]] AM, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] born Australian who specializes in multicultural marketing and businesses, the awards' goal was to "recognise and reward the contributions of migrants to the [[Australian economy]]".

{{nihongo|'''Gen Fukunaga'''|福永 元|Fukunaga Gen|born 22 March 1962}} is a [[Japanese American]] [[entrepreneur]] who founded [[Funimation]] and currently serves as its president, a company that distributes [[anime]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. As of October 2011, Fukunaga was named chairman of online video game publisher [[GameSamba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-10-27/funimation-ceo-gen-fukunaga-named-gamesamba-chairman Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga Named GameSamba Chairman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fukunaga was born in [[Itami, Hyōgo]], [[Japan]], and grew up in [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] in the [[United States]]. He graduated from [[West Lafayette Junior-Senior High School|West Lafayette High School]] in 1979.

Fukunaga attended [[Purdue University]] where he got his [[Bachelor of Engineering|BSEE]] in 1982 and his [[MSEE]] in 1984. He later moved to [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]] to work as an engineer for [[IBM]]. He then attended [[Columbia Business School]], obtaining an MBA in 1989. He held a position with Andersen Consulting (now [[Accenture]]) before getting a job with [[Tandem Computers]] in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]].

Fukunaga is also the co-founder and manager of [[EchoLight Studios]], a Texas-based Christian production company run by [[Rick Santorum]]. EchoLight initially shared office space with Fukunaga's [[Funimation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinstein |first1=Adam |title=Rick Santorum's Wholesome Film Studio Has a Smutty Anime Secret |url=http://gawker.com/rick-santorums-wholesome-film-studio-has-a-smutty-anim-1552802755 |website=Gawker |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=2 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703030939/http://gawker.com/rick-santorums-wholesome-film-studio-has-a-smutty-anim-1552802755 |archivedate=3 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Toei Animation told Funimation that they could not have the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. However Fukunaga's uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was one of the producers for Toei and helped Fukunaga convince Toei Animation to give the licence to Funimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atTdTl3UOzI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m33s | title=Dragon Ball Z Blu-ray Live Interview w/ Gen Fukunaga | publisher=FUNimation | date=October 6, 2011 | accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Gen went to a coworker named Daniel Cocanougher whose family owned a [[feed mill]] in [[Decatur, Texas]] and convinced the Cocanougher family to sell their business and invest in creating a production company. With that, FUNimation Productions was established in 1994.{{citation needed|date=March 2015|reason=this paragraph needs citation}}

In 2005, Funimation was acquired by the [[Navarre Corporation]] for US$100.4 million, Fukunaga still remained the company's CEO. In 2011, the company was sold to a group of investors which included Fukunaga himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-05-11/navarre-acquires-funimation Navarre Sells Funimation to Group with Gen Fukunaga]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Funimation was sold to [[Sony Pictures Television|Sony Pictures Television Networks]] for US$143 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/08/01/funimation-agrees-acquired-sony-pictures-television-networks/|title=Funimation Agrees To Be Acquired By Sony Pictures Television Networks |website=funimation.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Fukunaga is married to Cindy Brennan, who also was a co-founder and former executive producer at Funimation. They have three children.

Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of [[economic globalization]], its evolution is marked by the establishment of [[central bank]]s, [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty|treaties]], and [[intergovernmental organization]]s aimed at improving the [[transparency (market)|transparency]], [[financial regulation|regulation]], and effectiveness of international markets.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Patomaki 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalization and Economy, Vol. 2: Globalizing Finance and the N tennis ball taste like bacon ew Economy | author = James, Paul W. | authorlink = Paul James (academic) | author2 = Patomäki, Heikki | year = 2007 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-1-4129-1952-4| url = https://www.academia.edu/4211923/Globalization_and_Economy_Vol._2_Global_Finance_and_the_New_Global_Economy_editor_with_Heikki_Patomaki_Sage_Publications_London_2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Capitals of Capital: A History of International Financial Centres, 1780–2005 | author = Cassis, Youssef | year = 2006 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-511-33522-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=geEzo9s9QbUC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name="Flandreau et al. 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial History in the Twentieth Century: System and Anarchy | author = Flandreau, Marc | author2 = Holtfrerich, Carl-Ludwig | author3 = James, Harold | year = 2003 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-511-07011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of [[World War I]], trade contracted as [[foreign exchange market]]s became paralyzed by [[money market]] illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening the effects of the global [[Great Depression]] until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]] after [[World War II]] improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.

A series of currency devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The [[world economy]] became increasingly [[financial integration|financially integrated]] in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of [[financial crisis|financial crises]] in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile [[capital (economics)|capital flows]]. The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], which originated in the United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide [[Great Recession]]. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its [[currency union|monetary union]] in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone crisis]].

A country's decision to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications captured by the [[balance of payments]]. It also renders exposure to risks in [[international finance]], such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and [[international business]]es undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.

While the global financial system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.

===Emergence of financial globalization: 1870–1914===

The world experienced substantial changes in the late 19th century which created an environment favorable to an increase in and development of [[financial centre|international financial centers]]. Principal among such changes were unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid financial center integration, as well as faster communication. Before 1870, [[London]] and [[Paris]] existed as the world's only prominent financial centers.&lt;ref name=Cassis2005&gt;{{cite book|title=London and Paris as International Financial Centres in the Twentieth Century|date=2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191533471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5RfAlbhtswC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Soon after, [[Berlin]] and [[New York City|New York]] grew to become major centres providing [[financial services]] for their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers became important as they found [[market niche]]s, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Zurich]], and [[Geneva]]. London remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|74–75}}&lt;ref name="Cameron &amp; Bovykin 1991"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Banking: 1870–1914 | editor = Cameron, Rondo | editor2 = Bovykin, V.I. | year = 1991 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-506271-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItqhNQusviAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–15}}

The first modern wave of [[economic globalization]] began during the period of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of [[human migration|migration]], enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|75}} During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them.&lt;ref name="Benedictus 2006"&gt;{{Cite news | title = A brief history of the passport | author = Benedictus, Leo | date = 2006-11-16 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/17/travelnews | accessdate = 2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the [[United Nations]]' [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].&lt;ref name="Passport Canda 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = International Civil Aviation Organization: A trusted international authority | publisher = Passport Canada | url = http://passport.gc.ca/eppt/role.aspx?lang=eng | accessdate = 2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the [[United States]], while most of the rest reached [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Brazil]]. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of [[steamboat|steam-powered boats]] over traditional [[sailing ship]]s. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo [[tonnage]] surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the [[telephone]] and [[wireless telegraphy]] (the precursor to [[radio]]) revolutionized [[telecommunication]] by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and [[Asia]] became connected through new [[landline]]s.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|75–76}}&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 10th Edition | author = Carbaugh, Robert J. | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 978-0-324-52724-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Economic globalization grew under [[free trade]], starting in 1860 when the [[United Kingdom]] entered into a [[free trade area|free trade agreement]] with [[France]] known as the [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty]]. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to [[protectionism]] between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] introduced [[German tariff of 1879|protective tariffs]] on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making [[Germany]] the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the [[Méline tariff]], greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, [[international trade]] continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

Unprecedented growth in foreign investment from the 1880s to the 1900s served as the core driver of financial globalization. The worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to [[US$]]44 billion in 1913 ($1.02 trillion in 2012 dollars&lt;ref name="BLS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = CPI Inflation Calculator | publisher = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url = http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm | accessdate = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with the greatest share of foreign assets held by the United Kingdom (42%), France (20%), Germany (13%), and the United States (8%). The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]] together held foreign investments on par with Germany at around 12%.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

====Panic of 1907====
{{Main|Panic of 1907}}
{{See also|List of banking crises}}
[[Image:1907 Panic.png|thumb|upright|A crowd forms on [[Wall Street]] during the [[Panic of 1907]].]]
In October 1907, the United States experienced a [[bank run]] on the [[Knickerbocker Trust Company]], forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[George B. Cortelyou]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan|John Pierpont "J.P." Morgan]] deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a [[money market]] crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for [[credit (finance)|credit]] heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The [[Bank of England]] had to sustain an artificially high [[discount window|discount lending]] rate until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four different nations, for which the [[Banque de France]] temporarily lent £3 million ([[Pound sterling|GBP]], 305.6 million in 2012 GBP&lt;ref name="BOE 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Inflation Calculator | publisher = Bank of England | url = http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx | accessdate = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in gold.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|123–124}}

====Birth of the U.S. Federal Reserve System: 1913====
{{Main|Federal Reserve System}}
The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Federal Reserve Act]] in 1913, giving rise to the Federal Reserve System. Its inception drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a [[lender of last resort]]. The system's design also considered the findings of the [[Pujo Committee]]'s investigation of the possibility of a [[money trust]] in which [[Wall Street]]'s concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which [[investment banking|investment bankers]] were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the [[board of directors|directorates]] of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' [[money supply]] during significant shifts in [[demand for money|money demand]]. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to [[rediscount]] facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive [[money market#discount and accrual instruments|discount market]].&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|123–124}}&lt;ref name="Cameron &amp; Bovykin 1991" /&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Foreign Exchange Market of London: Development since 1900 | author = Atkin, John | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-203-32269-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2013"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Fed in 2008 Showed Panic of 1907 Was Excessive: Cutting Research | author = Kennedy, Simon | date = 2013-05-09 | publisher = Bloomberg | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/fed-in-2008-showed-panic-of-1907-was-excessive-cutting-research.html | accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar period: 1915–1944===

[[Image:German infantry 1914 HD-SN-99-02296.JPEG|thumb|German infantry crossing a battlefield in France in August 1914.]]
[[Image:4th Bn Royal Fusiliers 22 August 1914.jpg|thumb|British soldiers resting before the [[Battle of Mons]] with German troops along the French border in August 1914.]]
Economists have referred to the onset of World War I as the end of an age of innocence for [[foreign exchange market]]s, as it was the first [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's [[Western Front (World War I)#1914—German invasion of France and Belgium|invasion of France and Belgium]]. In the weeks prior, the [[foreign exchange market]] in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing [[political risk|political uncertainty]] motivated investors to chase [[market liquidity|liquidity]], prompting [[commercial bank]]s to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their [[bank reserves|reserves]] at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for [[remittance]] to London just to pay off their newly [[maturity (finance)|maturing]] [[security (finance)|securities]], the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the [[French franc]] after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record [[exchange rate]] of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended [[bank holiday]]s, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]], and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for [[merchant bank]]s receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's [[reserve currency]] and leading [[hard currency|vehicle currency]], market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|23–24}}

The [[Government of the United Kingdom|U.K. government]] attempted several measures to revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon the end of the war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military [[weapon|armament]]s, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|25–27}}

In 1930, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] established the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS). The principal purposes of the BIS were to manage the scheduled payment of Germany's reparations imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and to function as a bank for central banks around the world. Nations may hold a portion of their reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|182}}&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|531–532}}&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Managing International Financial Instability: National Tamers versus Global Tigers | author = Saccomanni, Fabrizio | year = 2008 | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Limited | location = Cheltenham, UK | isbn = 978-1-84542-142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56–57}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 6th Edition | author = Dunn, Robert M., Jr. | author2 = Mutti, John H. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-31154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}}

====Smoot–Hawley tariff of 1930====
{{Main|Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act}}
U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] signed the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's aim was to protect agriculture in the United States, but [[Member of Congress|congressional representatives]] ultimately raised tariffs on a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling [[agribusiness]]es and reduce the domestic [[unemployment rate]]. The culmination of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]] heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of [[Henry Ford]] and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a [[veto]] of the act.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|175–176}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|186–187}}&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Economics of the World Trading System | author = Bagwell, Kyle | author2 = Staiger, Robert W. | year = 2004 | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 978-0-262-52434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43–44}} Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|118}} Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics: Global Markets and Competition, 2nd Edition | author = Thompson, Henry | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = Toh Tuck Link, Singapore | isbn = 978-981-256-346-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125–126}} The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of [[economic nationalism]], are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Flandreau et al. 2003" /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

====Formal abandonment of the Gold Standard====
{{Main|Gold standard}}
[[Image:Graph charting income per capita throughout the Great Depression.svg|thumb|260px|right|[[Per capita income|Income per capita]] throughout the [[Great Depression]] as viewed from an international perspective. Triangles mark points at which nations abandoned the gold standard by suspending gold convertibility or devaluing their currencies against gold.]]
The classical gold standard was established in 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its [[banknote]]s for gold [[precious metal#Bullion|bullion]]. France, Germany, the United States, [[Russia]], and [[Japan]] each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], Germany, Russia, and [[Poland]] began experiencing [[hyperinflation]]. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from [[fixed exchange-rate system|exchange rate fixing]] and allowed to [[floating exchange rate|float]]. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The early years of the Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on [[gold reserve]]s in the United Kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the [[Dresdner Bank]] implemented [[foreign exchange controls]] and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and [[Sweden]] abandoned gold. Following widespread [[bank failure]]s and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Léon Blum]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|414}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

====Trade liberalization in the United States====
{{Main|Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act}}
{{See also|Glass–Steagall Legislation}}
The disastrous effects of the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the 32nd U.S. president and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of [[trade liberalization]]. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|176–177}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|186–187}}&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}}

As the inception of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]] for the [[Bretton Woods Conference|United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]], now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant of the effects of the Great Depression, struggles to sustain the [[Gold standard#Depression and World War II|international gold standard]] during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the [[international monetary system]] focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored [[fixed exchange-rate system#Hybrid exchange rate systems|pegged exchange rates]] for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|448}}&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Forex Revolution: An Insider's Guide to the Real World of Foreign Exchange Trading | author = Rosenstreich, Peter | year = 2005 | publisher = Financial Times–Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | isbn = 0-13-148690-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name="Chen 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Essentials of Foreign Exchange Trading | author = Chen, James | year = 2009 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-470-39086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Options on Foreign Exchange, 3rd Edition | author = DeRosa, David F. | year = 2011 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-1-118-09821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|491–493}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Multinational Finance | author = Buckley, Adrian | year = 2004 | publisher = Pearson Education Limited | location = Harlow, UK | isbn = 978-0-273-68209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]] tools before resorting to repegging strategies.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|448}}&lt;ref name="Wang 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Economics of Foreign Exchange and Global Finance | author = Wang, Peijie | year = 2005 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany | isbn = 978-3-540-21237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment.

An important component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of [[gross world product]], from which emergency loans could be issued.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = A Foreign Exchange Primer | author = Shamah, Shani | year = 2003 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester, West Sussex, England | isbn = 0-470-85162-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–10}}&lt;ref name="Thirkell-White 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The IMF and the Politics of Financial Globalization: From the Asian Crisis to a New International Financial Architecture? | author = Thirkell-White, Ben | year = 2005 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-2078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–22}} Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ [[capital control]]s as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|38}} While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects.&lt;ref name="Endres 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Great Architects of International Finance | author = Endres, Anthony M. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-32412-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Future of the International Monetary System | editor = Uzan, Marc | year = 2005 | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Limited | location = Northampton, MA | isbn = 1-84376-805-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Since the establishment of the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the [[World Bank]].

====General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: 1947====
{{Main|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade}}
{{See also|List of free trade agreements|List of international trade topics}}
In 1947, 23 countries concluded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended the agreement to suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body to be known as the [[International Trade Organization]] (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the ''de facto'' framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains.&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004" /&gt;{{rp|46}} The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services.&lt;ref name="Bryant 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Crisis Prevention and Prosperity Management for the World Economy | author = Bryant, Ralph C. | year = 2004 | publisher = Brookings Institution Press | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 0-8157-0867-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and [[export subsidy|subsidizing]] non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|460}} The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2006" /&gt;{{rp|108}} However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements.&lt;ref name="Makin 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Global Imbalances, Exchange Rates and Stabilization Policy | author = Makin, Anthony J. | year = 2009 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-230-57685-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70–71}} The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|99}}

===Resurgence of financial globalization===

====Flexible exchange rate regimes: 1973-present====
[[Image:Reserves of foreign exchange and gold.PNG|thumb|400px|World reserves of foreign exchange and gold in billions of U.S. dollars in 2009.]]
Although the exchange rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|22}} The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was [[valuation risk|overvalued]]. Belgian-American economist [[Robert Triffin]] defined this problem now known as the [[Triffin dilemma]], in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|34–35}}

France voiced concerns over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the [[Vietnam War]]. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first [[current account]] deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold as part of the [[Nixon Shock]]. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|34–35}}&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Risk in International Finance | author = Yadav, Vikash | year = 2008 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-77519-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the [[Smithsonian Agreement]] signed by the [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]] members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years.&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises of the 1970s]] which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in [[petrodollar recycling]] and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|5–7}}

=====The post-Bretton Woods financial order: 1976=====
{{See also|International Monetary Fund}}
[[Image:IMF HQ.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in Washington, D.C.]]
As part of the first amendment to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|50–51}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|117}}&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion [[ISO 4217|XDR]] from 1970 to 1972.&lt;ref name="Endres 2005" /&gt;{{rp|182–183}}

IMF members signed the [[Jamaica Agreement]] in January 1976, which ratified the end of the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank [[economic interventionism|interventions]] aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently [[legal tender#Demonetisation|demonetized]] its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing [[conditionality]] on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Thirkell-White 2005" /&gt;{{rp|47–48}}&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Globalization and Its Discontents | author = Stiglitz, Joseph E. | year = 2003 | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-393-32439-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–13}}

The second amendment to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|62–63}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|138}} This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point in the evolution of the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|148}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

Under the dominance of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars&lt;ref name="BLS 2013" /&gt;) as a result of the dollar's strong appreciation. The [[Group of Five|G5]] met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the [[Plaza Accord]]. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now [[G8]]) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the [[Louvre Accord]]. This accord became the provenance of the [[managed float regime]] by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the [[Dot-com bubble]]. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the [[September 11 attacks]] increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|175}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"/&gt;{{rp|36–37}}&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|147}}&lt;ref name="Reszat 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Japanese Foreign Exchange Market | author = Reszat, Beate | year = 2003 | publisher = Routledge | location = New Fetter Lane, London | isbn = 0-203-22254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=====European Monetary System: 1979=====
{{Main|European Monetary System}}
Following the Smithsonian Agreement, member states of the [[European Economic Community]] adopted a narrower [[currency band]] of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the ''[[snake in the tunnel]]''. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of [[European Union]] members' currencies, and the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values.&lt;ref name="Atkin 2005" /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|42–44}}&lt;ref name="Steiner 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Theory, Practice and Risk Management | author = Steiner, Bob | year = 2002 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Woburn, MA | isbn = 0-7506-5025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}} The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that [[currency pair]] were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|496–497}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|29–30}} The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen 2008" /&gt;{{rp|160}} During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT [[multilateral trade negotiations]] took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the [[Marrakech Agreement]] signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005" /&gt;{{rp|181}}&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;{{rp|459–460}}&lt;ref name="Bagwell &amp; Staiger 2004" /&gt;{{rp|47}} In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.&lt;ref name="WTO News 1999"&gt;{{Cite press release | title = The WTO's financial services commitments will enter into force as scheduled | author = World Trade Organization | date = 1999-02-15 | publisher = WTO News | url = http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr120_e.htm | accessdate = 2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust [[bank regulation]]s, and strong legal protection of [[property rights (economics)|property rights]]. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging [[foreign direct investment]], liberalizing domestic [[equity (finance)|equity capital]], and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|113}} An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and [[sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]]s, which carry serious economic and social costs.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008" /&gt;{{rp|xii}}

Countries sought to improve the sustainability and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the [[Basel Accords]]. The first of these accords, known as [[Basel I]], took place in 1988 and emphasized [[credit risk]] and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the [[Latin American debt crisis|1980s Latin American debt crisis]]. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new [[capital requirement]]s for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (reconstituted by the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] in 2009 as the [[Financial Stability Board]]) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|222–223}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The [[Basel II]] accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk as well as the need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|486–488}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|160–162}} In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as [[Basel III]], which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|274}}&lt;ref name="Hamilton &amp; Onaran 2013"&gt;{{Cite news | title = U.S. Boosts Bank Capital Demands Above Global Standards | author = Hamilton, Jesse | author2 = Onaran, Yalman | date = 2013-07-09 | publisher = Bloomberg | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-09/u-s-banks-may-face-two-ratios-as-fdic-sets-capital-vote.html | accessdate = 2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth of the European Economic and Monetary Union 1992====
{{Main|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}

In February 1992, European Union countries signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the [[European Monetary Institute]] which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in 1998 of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and [[European System of Central Banks]]. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of [[euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the [[Euro]], adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they [[disaggregated sovereignty|disaggregated]] their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. {{As of|2011}}, the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004" /&gt;{{rp|473–474}}&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|45–4}}&lt;ref name="DeRosa 2011" /&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref name="Steiner 2002" /&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

====Global financial crisis====
{{Main|Financial crisis of 2007–08|Great Recession}}
Following the market turbulence of the 1990s financial crises and [[September 11 attacks]] on the U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s and [[structured product|structured finance product]]s. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily in the form of short-term [[money market]] instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders in the wake of the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999]] which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by [[global imbalances]] which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|129–130}}

The global financial crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared some of the key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, [[herd behavior]] during investment [[economic bubble|bubbles]], collapsing asset prices, and massive [[deleveraging]]. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing [[securitization]] of [[non-performing asset]]s, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|18–20}}&lt;ref name="Makin 2009" /&gt;{{rp|21–22}} While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the [[global recession|global economic downturn]] now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The global financial crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.&lt;ref name="Arndt et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The implications of integration for globalization | journal = North American Journal of Economics and Finance | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | year = 2009 | pages = 83–90 | author = Arndt, Sven W. | author2 = Crowley, Patrick M. | author3 = Mayes, David G. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940809000229 | accessdate = 2011-11-30 | doi=10.1016/j.najef.2009.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence et al. 2012"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The Global Enabling Trade Report 2012: Reducing Supply Chain Barriers | publisher = World Economic Forum | date = 2012 | author = Lawrence, Robert Z. | author2 = Hanouz, Margareta Drzeniek | author3 = Doherty, Sean | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GETR/2012/GlobalEnablingTrade_Report.pdf | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

====Eurozone crisis====
{{Main|European debt crisis|Great Recession in Europe}}
In 2009, a newly elected government in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, and that its fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP as opposed to the 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the [[eurozone]]'s maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's [[Stability and Growth Pact]]. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the [[PIGS (economics)|PIGS]]). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of [[refinancing]] or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery in the wake of the Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion [[bailout]] for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]] [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|12–14}}&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics: Theory &amp; Policy, 9th Edition | author = Krugman, Paul R. | author2 = Obstfeld, Maurice | author3 = Melitz, Marc J. | year = 2012 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 978-0-13-214665-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|579–581}}

==Implications of globalized capital==

===Balance of payments===
{{Main|Balance of payments}}
[[Image:TopFiveCurrentAccountImbalancesOECD2012.png|thumb|right|The top five annual current account deficits and surpluses in billions of U.S. dollars for the year 2012 based on data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].]]
The balance of payments accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The balance of payments is a function of three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the [[current account]], transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the [[financial account]], and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the [[capital account]].&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012" /&gt;{{rp|306–307}} The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|66–71}}&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169–172}}&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 0-324-36563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–35}}

Because the balance of payments sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates the extent to which a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, the balance of payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref name="Krugman et al. 2012" /&gt;{{rp|308–313}}&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|203}} A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.&lt;ref name="Thirlwall 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The balance of payments constraint as an explanation of international growth rate differences | author = Thirlwall, A.P. | encyclopedia = Essays on Balance of Payments Constrained Growth: Theory and Evidence | editor = McCombie, J.S.L. | editor2 = Thirlwall, A.P. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = London, UK | isbn = 0-203-49536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–22}}

A country's external wealth is measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by [[capital gain]]s and [[capital loss]]es on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or [[creditor]]) in the [[world economy]], while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or [[debtor]]).&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|13,210}}

===Unique financial risks===
{{Main|Systemic risk}}
Nations and international businesses face an array of [[financial risk]]s unique to foreign investment activity. [[Political risk]] is the potential for losses from a foreign country's [[failed state|political instability]] or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|422}} Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to [[expropriation|expropriate]] or [[nationalization|nationalize]] foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|14–17}} Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|425,526}}&lt;ref name="Melvin &amp; Norrbin 2013"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Money and Finance, 8th Edition | author = Melvin, Michael | author2 = Norrbin, Stefan C. | year = 2013 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Waltham, MA | isbn = 978-0-12-385247-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

==Participants==

===Economic actors===
{{See also|List of multinational corporations|List of investment banks}}
Each of the core economic functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} [[Consumer]]s, [[multinational corporations]], individual and [[institutional investors]], and [[financial intermediaries]] (such as [[bank]]s) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the [[European Central Bank]] or the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]]) undertake [[open market operation]]s in their efforts to realize monetary policy goals.&lt;ref name="Chen 2009" /&gt;{{rp|13–15}}&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;{{rp|11–13,76}} [[International financial institutions]] such as the [[international financial institutions#Bretton Woods institutions|Bretton Woods institutions]], [[international financial institutions#Multilateral development bank|multilateral development banks]] and other [[development finance institution]]s provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives.&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|243}} Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, [[Institute of International Finance]], and the [[World Federation of Exchanges]] attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.&lt;ref name="WTO What We Do 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What we do | publisher = World Trade Organization | url = http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_we_do_e.htm | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IIF About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About IIF | publisher = Institute of International Finance | url = http://www.iif.com/about/ | accessdate = 2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFE About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About WFE | publisher = World Federation of Exchanges | url = http://www.world-exchanges.org/about-wfe | accessdate = 2013-11-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209064829/http://world-exchanges.org/about-wfe | archivedate = 2013-12-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory bodies===
{{See also|List of financial regulatory authorities by country}}
Explicit goals of financial regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2008" /&gt;{{rp|57}} A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, [[deposit insurance]], emergency financing through discount windows, [[standard accounting practice]]s, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated to establish a host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture.&lt;ref name="Saccomanni 2008" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as [[central government|national government]]s and intergovernmental organizations have the capacity to influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}}

Some degree of [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] occurs whereby banks and other financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System&lt;ref name="BIS CGFS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Committee on the Global Financial System | publisher = Bank for International Settlements | url = http://www.bis.org/cgfs/ | accessdate = 2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Shamah 2003" /&gt;{{rp|33–34}} Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]] (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] which facilitates collaboration in battling [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]]; and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the [[Paris Club]] and [[London Club]].&lt;ref name="Elson 2011" /&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities.&lt;ref name="Rosenstreich 2005" /&gt;{{rp|61–64}} Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the [[European Banking Authority]] (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="EBA About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About us | publisher = European Banking Authority | url = http://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us | accessdate = 2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESFRC About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) | publisher = Centre for European Policy Studies | url = http://www.ceps.be/content/european-shadow-financial-regulatory-committee-esfrc | accessdate = 2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research organizations and other fora===
Research and academic institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan [[World Economic Forum]] facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="WEF GAC on GFS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System 2012–2014 | publisher = World Economic Forum | url = http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-agenda-council-global-financial-system-2012-2014 | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEF GAC on IMS 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System 2012–2014 | publisher = World Economic Forum | url = http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-agenda-council-international-monetary-system-2012-2014 | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world.&lt;ref name="GFMA About 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About GFMA | publisher = Global Financial Markets Association | url = http://gfma.org/about/ | accessdate = 2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group of Thirty]] (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of [[international economics]] and global finance.&lt;ref name="G30 About"&gt;{{Cite web | title = History of the Group | publisher = Group of Thirty | url = http://www.group30.org/about.shtml | accessdate = 2014-09-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140929134355/http://www.group30.org/about.shtml | archivedate = 2014-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the global financial system==
The IMF has reported that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural [[deleveraging]] in short-term securities and in the [[shadow banking system]] (particularly the [[secondary mortgage market|mortgage market]] and [[real estate investment trust]]s). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth so as not to provoke investor withdrawal.&lt;ref name="IMF GFSR 2013"&gt;{{Cite report | title = Global Financial Stability Report: Transition Challenges to Stability, October 2013 | publisher = International Monetary Fund | date = 2013 | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GETR/2012/GlobalEnablingTrade_Report.pdf | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi-xiii}}

The global financial crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed discourse on the architecture of the global financial system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of [[global governance]], and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization.&lt;ref name="Wyman 2010"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The Future of the Global Financial System: Navigating the Challenges Ahead | publisher = World Economic Forum | date = 2010 | author = Wyman, Oliver | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FutureGlobalFinancialSystem_Report_2010.pdf | accessdate = 2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–9}} Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically.

He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.&lt;ref name="Uzan 2005" /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

The [[Council on Foreign Relations]]' assessment of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, are the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded before and after the global financial crisis to the extent that the United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.&lt;ref name="CFR Global Finance Regime 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Global Finance Regime | publisher = Council on Foreign Relations | url = http://www.cfr.org/financial-regulation/global-finance-regime/p20177 | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform efforts===
Former [[World Bank Chief Economist]] and former Chairman of the U.S. [[Council of Economic Advisers]] [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] referred in the late 1990s to a growing consensus that something is wrong with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great number of people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of [[moral hazard]], particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.&lt;ref name="PBS Stiglitz Interview 1999"&gt;{{Cite interview|author=Stiglitz, Joseph E. |work=Frontline |date=Spring 1999 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/crash/interviews/stiglitz.html |accessdate=2013-12-29 |title=Interviews - Joseph E.

American economist and former [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]] has argued that the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.&lt;ref name="Volcker 2012"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Is global financial reform possible? | author = Volcker, Paul | date = 2012-06-06 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/jun/06/global-financial-reform-possible | accessdate = 2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of the Bank of England]] and former [[Governor of the Bank of Canada]] [[Mark Carney]] has described two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, as well as better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must bear the burden of financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed "living wills" which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.&lt;ref name="Carney 2009"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Reforming the global financial system | author = Carney, Mark | event = Rendez-vous avec 'Autorité des marchés financiers | location = Montréal, Québec, Canada | date = 2009-10-26 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r091028b.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2010 G-20 Seoul summit.jpg|thumb|350px|World leaders at the 2010 G-20 summit in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], endorsed the [[Basel III]] standards for banking regulation.]]
At its [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|2010 summit]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the G-20 collectively endorsed a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, and degree of interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts should be made to identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.&lt;ref name="Dombret 2011"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Reform of the global financial system | author = Dombret, Andreas | event = Generation Forum | location = Eltville, Germany | date = 2011-06-16 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r110621h.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] and Vice Chairman of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] [[William C. Dudley]] has argued that a global financial system regulated on a largely national basis is untenable for supporting a world economy with global financial firms. In 2011, he advocated five pathways to improving the safety and security of the global financial system: a special capital requirement for financial institutions deemed systemically important; a level playing field which discourages exploitation of disparate regulatory environments and [[beggar thy neighbour]] policies that serve "national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability"; superior cooperation among regional and national regulatory regimes with broader protocols for sharing information such as records for the trade of [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] financial derivatives; improved delineation of "the responsibilities of the home versus the host country" when banks encounter trouble; and well-defined procedures for managing emergency liquidity solutions across borders including which parties are responsible for the risk, terms, and funding of such measures.&lt;ref name="Dudley 2011"&gt;{{Cite speech | title = Regulatory reform of the global financial system | author = Dudley, William C. | event = Meeting hosted by the Institute of Regulation &amp; Risk | location = Tokyo, Japan | date = 2011-04-11 | url = http://www.bis.org/review/r110411f.pdf | accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35685">The '''history of [[business architecture]]''' has its origins in the 1980s. In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of "cross-organizational design of the business as a whole"&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; closely related to [[enterprise architecture]]. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise,&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"/&gt; as business strategy,&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"/&gt; and also as the representation of business design.&lt;ref name="SC 2010"/&gt;

The concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as [[architectural domain]]s and as activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.

By 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Overview ==
Business architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the "responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"&gt;Paul Arthur Bodine and Jack Hilty. "Business Architecture: An Emerging Profession," at ''businessarchitectsassociation.org,'' Business Architects Association Institute. April 28, 2009. ([http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107140443/http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf |date=2010-11-07 }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zachman]] (2012) commented in this context, that "a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911) by Frederick Taylor."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"&gt;[[John A. Zachman]] "Foreword" in: Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus &amp; Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand "Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models)."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"&gt;[[Bernus, Peter]], and Ovidiu Noran. "[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054819/document A metamodel for enterprise architecture]," ''Enterprise Architecture, Integration and Interoperability.'' Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. 56-65.&lt;/ref&gt; And on the other hand "proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;

More specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan &amp; Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is "maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio planning and change management – to name but a few.&lt;ref name="WM 2012"&gt;Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==

=== Concept ===
The concept of business architecture emerged in the 1980s in the field of information systems development. One of the first to mention business architecture was the British management consultant [[Edwin E. Tozer]] in the 1986 article "Developing strategies for management information systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"&gt;[[Tozer, Edwin E.]] "Developing strategies for management information systems." ''Long Range Planning'' 19.4 (1986): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of business architecture in the context of [[business information systems planning]], and distinguished:
* Business architecture, and 
* [[Information architecture]], 
And he explained, that "each entity class in the Information Architecture is represented in some database and each business function may be supported by one or more systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"/&gt; In this paper Tozer was "prescriptive about the order in which [strategy] issues should be identified.",&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Jane, and Pam Hinton. "Case study-an information systems strategy: development and evolution at the University of Hertfordshire." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and focussed on "IS adaptability to organizational strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Palanisamy, Ramaraj. "Measurement and Enablement of Information Systems for Organizational Flexibility: An Empirical Study." Journal of Services Research 3.2 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First models ===
The American organizational theorist [[William R. Synnott]] (1987) presented one of the first models of business architecture, (see image), in the context of [[data management]]. Synnott wanted to develop an overall Information Resource Management (IRM) architecture, and proposed business architecture as its foundation. He described: 
[[File:Business architecture by Synnott, 1987 (2).svg|thumb|360px|Business architecture by Synnott, 1987]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Business architecture is the foundation upon which the IRM architecture rests. The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm... In the figure data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"&gt;[[William R. Synnott]] (1987). ''The Information Weapon: Winning Customers and Markets With Technology.'' p. 199-220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This model of Information Resource Management (IRM) distinguished seven types of architecture: 
* ''Centralized'': Business architecture, [[Data architecture]], and Communication architecture 
* ''Decentralized'' : Human resources architecture, [[Computer architecture]], User-computing architecture, and [[Systems architecture]].

This type of architectural model classifies different types of architecture. In the later theories and models different sets of architectures have been proposed. For example, the late 1980s [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]] distinguished five types, and this was incorporated in the 1990s [[Federal Enterprise Architecture]], which contained four types of architecture.

=== Base for the total development process ===
Synnott (1987) furthermore described, how business architecture should work and introduced the idea of architectural planning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The business architecture of the company (organization structure, strategic business units and missions, product and services) is the foundation of IRM planning. Since every company has an existing architecture, architectural planning begins with an inventory of the firm's information resources. Assembling the various information resource components' inventories results in an "as is" picture of the corporation's technology structure. From this inventory, the CIO can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company's information resources, particularly as they relate to business information needs as identified in the strategic planning process. From this analysis one can evolve an architectural plan, which is a "to be" picture of where one wants to go and how to get there, not just a picture of the status quo.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cees J. Schrama. (1988) of the European [[International Federation for Information Processing#IFIP TC8|IFIP Technical Committee on Information Systems]] IFIP TC8 presented the opinion, that "business architecture is required to provide a solid base for the total development process." He pictured another model consisted of elements such as information processing architecture and network architecture, and explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Business architecture] contains the fundamentals for the information processing architecture, where process data, support systems and network architecture are performed. In business architecture the following can 'be identified:
:- enterprise analysis: to indicate the business domains
:- business analysis
:- Information systems planning
There are some basic elements in business architecture: management, organization, processes to be performed and data to be made available/delivered. In the past, when mainly operational systems were developed, the processes received considerable attention. Information was seen as being needed to perform processes. This is changing. It is becoming important to have data available to serve information retrieval needs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cees J. Schrama. "Composition and Decomposition in the Development of IS," in: Péter Kovács &amp; [[Elek Straub]] (editors). ''Governmental and Municipal Information Systems: Proceedings of the IFIP TC8 Conference on Governmental and Municipal Information Systems, Budapest, Hungary, September 8–11, 1987.'' [[IFIP TC8]], 1988. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These ideas around the concept of architectural planning evolved in th early 1990s into frameworks, such as [[TAFIM]], the predecessor of [[TOGAF]].

=== View models of enterprise architecture ===
In the 1987 article "A Framework for Information Systems Architecture" [[John Zachman]] presented some of the principles of Enterprise architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Zachman, John A. "A framework for information systems architecture." ''IBM systems journal'' 26.3 (1987): 276-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Framework for information systems architecture ===
[[File:NIST AE model 1989.jpg|thumb|240px|[[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]], one of the first EA models, 1989.]]
In the 5th [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model#NIST workshop on Information Management Directions|NIST workshop on Information Management Directions]] (1989) a working groups under guidance of [[W. Bradford Rigdon]] developed one of the first [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]s, the [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]]. In this model business architecture was incorporated as one of the layers of Enterprise Architecture. Bradford Rigdon et al. (1989) brought it like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A discussion of architecture must take into account different levels of architecture. These levels can be illustrated by a pyramid, with the business unit at the top and the delivery system at the base. An enterprise is composed of one or more Business Units that are responsible for a specific business area. The five levels of architecture are
* Business Unit 
* Information 
* Information System
* Data 
* Delivery System
The levels are separate yet interrelated... The idea if an [[enterprise architecture]] reflects an awareness that the levels are logically connected and that a depiction at one level assumes or dictates that architectures at the higher level.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Bradford Rigdon]] (1989) "Architectures and Standards". In: ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge'' E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds). NIST Sept 1989. p. 137; Partly cited in: IT Governance Institute (2005) ''Governance of the Extended Enterprise''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the original 1989 illustration of the NIST AE Framework (see image) the top layer was named "Business Unit Architecture." In representation of this model in the 1990s the top layer was named "Business architecture."

== 1990s ==

=== The unfolding information age ===
In the 1990s the [[information age]] was unfolding&lt;ref&gt;[[Zachman, John A.]] "[http://www.cioindex.com/nm/articlefiles/63503-EAIssueForTheCenturyZachman.pdf Enterprise architecture: The issue of the century]." ''Database Programming and Design'' 10.3 (1997): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture...&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"&gt;[[Gharajedaghi, Jamshid]]. ''Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity: A platform for designing business architecture.'' Elsevier, 1999; 2nd ed. 2005, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bodine and Hilty (2009) "important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;

=== Descriptions ===
In the 1990s works the concept of business architecture is presented in distinguished ways: 
* ''As activity'' : Lindsay &amp; Price (1991) for example presented business architecture as a "self security activity," which included the "study of a function, including its component organizations, tools, methods, and relationships, both internal and external... The very activity of identifying and listing all these elements is an important learning process for managers. In addition to the element identification and listing processes, the architecture develops a set of principles. Principles are semi-permanent statements of philosophy. That is, they are the basic rules by which managers agree they want to operate."&lt;ref&gt;David T. Lindsay, W. L. Price, ''Information security: proceedings of the IFIP TC11 Seventh International Conference on Information Security--Creating Confidence in Information Processing, IFIP/Sec '91, Brighton, UK, 15–17 May 1991.'' 1991, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As blueprint or model of the enterprise'' : Bourke (1994) described it as "a set of integrated blueprints of the ... [enterprise]'s business processes,"&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"&gt;Michael K. Bourke (1994). Strategy and architecture of health care information systems. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and Veasey (1994) spoke of business architecture as "a model of the enterprise which is a mechanism for the management of change."&lt;ref&gt;Veasey, Philip W. "Managing a programme of business re-engineering projects in a diversified business." ''Long Range Planning'' 27.5 (1994): 124-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As strategy for any change program'' : Davis (1996) for example described that business architecture can be used to "describe the type of comprehensive plan required to set the stage for integrated change programmes. The term "architecture" connotes the level of creativity and holistic change required to achieve process excellence. A comprehensive business architecture defines the way in which human performance, processes and technology will be integrated to transform business performance and create value."&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"&gt;Peter T. Davis (1996) ''Securing Client/server Computer Networks.'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Business architectures is presented as tool for [[change management]], acknowledged Van Rensburg (1997). It "provide organisations with the means to understand organisational activities in such a manner that it is used as a mechanism to support the organisation through the business transformation process. Using an object-oriented modelling approach in the design of the business architecture allows for a robust modelling approach which captures real world instances in a business architecture repository. This enables the creation and caption of organisational understanding required for the transformation process."&lt;ref&gt;Van Rensburg, A. C. J. "An object-oriented architecture for business transformation." Computers &amp; industrial engineering 33.1 (1997): 167-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FEA and business subarchitecture ===
In 1996 the US government introduced the [[Clinger–Cohen Act]], to improve the acquisition and management of their information resources.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Enterprise reference architecture ===
Beside the enterprise architecture frameworks a second type of architectural models were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were called Enterprise Reference Architecture.&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; 
* GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987)
* [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] ([[Theodore J. Williams|Williams]] 1994)
* [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), 
* [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems]] ([[August-Wilhelm Scheer|Scheer]] 1999), and 
* [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999)

=== Foundation ===
In 1999 two works on business architecture and its foundation were published, which became two of the most cited works on business architecture. In his "Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity" [[Jamshid Gharajedaghi]] presented a set of principles to design business architecture, which were based on [[systems thinking]]. Gharajedaghi argued, that business Architecture should be considered a [[system]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Business Architecture is a general description of a [[system]]. It identifies its purpose, vital functions, active elements, and critical processes and defines the nature of the interaction among them. Business architecture consists of a set of distinct but interrelated platforms, creating a multidimensional modular system. Each platform represents a dimension of the system, signifying a unique mode of behavior with a predefined set of performance criteria and measures.&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IBM researcher Douglas W. McDavid presented the paper "A standard for business architecture description." According to Evernden &amp; Evernden (2003) this paper described a "high-level semantic framework of standard business concepts – abstracted from experience, enterprise business models, the organization of business terminology and the various generic industry reference models. There is an excellent discussion on what constitutes business architecture and the nature and use of information categories, although concepts such as product and agreement seem to be missing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Evernden]], Elaine Evernden (2003). Information First: Integrating Knowledge and Information. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; McDavid argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concepts in the Business Architecture description provide a semantic framework for speaking about common business concerns... For our purposes, this semantic structure provides a common set of concept patterns to be able to understand the types of content that needs to be supported in technology-based information systems... a set of generic concepts and their interrelationships organize business information content in terms of requirements on the business, the boundary of the business, and the business as a system for delivery of value.&lt;ref&gt;McDavid, Douglas W. "A standard for business architecture description." IBM Systems Journal 38.1 (1999): 12-31.; As cited in: Glissman &amp; Sanz (2009, p. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business architect ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The arrival of Internet technologies like email, instant messaging and online data repositories in the mid-1990s opened up tremendous flexibilities in the ways co-workers could collaborate, while the new ability of buyers and sellers to interact in virtual space and transact online changed the traditional structure of businesses...
By the late 1990s, MBAs with advanced skills in Internet technologies began developing live business models for e-commerce websites in real-time. They used the development tools to both represent and build the business at the same time. The model became the business, and thousands were launched, allowing companies to access vast volumes of data and respond rapidly to changing market conditions... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ at the time returned just 12 results... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ in 2009 returns over 1 million listings.
This is just the beginning of a valuable and rapidly expanding profession. Today‘s Business Architects take a holistic view of the complete business representing all interests and engaging all expertise. They see the business organization as a constantly changing, dynamic organism that balances central planning with individual initiative to achieve its mission through the articulate implementation of its corporate strategy.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tools and frameworks ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Architecture Frameworks have been used in many industries, including the domains of industrial automation / manufacturing / production management, business information systems (of various kinds), telecommunications and defence. Part of the Enterprise Architecture practice is ‘enterprise engineering’ and the practice of ‘enterprise modelling’ (or just modelling) and complete AFs describe the scope of modelling (which later can be summaised as a Modelling Framework that is part of the AF).&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One specific type of Framework is called the "Enterprise Reference Architecture." According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several proposals emerged in those two decades – e.g. [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] (Williams 1994), [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), ARIS (Scheer 1999), GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987), and the IFIP-IFAC Task Force, based on a thorough review of these as well as their proposed generalisation (Bernus and Nemes, 1994) developed [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999) which then became the basis of ISO15704:2000 “Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies”...&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business Architecture Working Group ===
{{main article|OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group}}
The Business Architecture Special Interest Group (BASIG) is a working group on business architecture of the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG).

=== Business strategy ===
In the 2006 article "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT," [[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] explained the relation between business architecture, business activities and business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schelp, Joachim, and [[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]. "Language communities in enterprise architecture research." ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology.'' ACM, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We use the concept of '[[Business Architecture]]’ to structure the responsibility over business activities prior to any further effort to structure individual aspects (processes, data, functions, organization, etc.). The business architecture arranges the responsibilities around the most important business activities (for instance production, distribution, marketing, et cetera) and/or economic activities (for instance manufacturing, assembly, transport, wholesale, et cetera) into domains &lt;ref&gt;[[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg, Gerrit]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] (2006, p. 92), as cited in: McClure, Mark. ''[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7665/2007-mcclure.pdf Framing a Collaborative Enterprise Architecture Governance Program within the Context of Service-Oriented Software Systems Development].'' University of Oregon Applied Information Management Program, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Versteeg &amp; Bouwman also stipulated, that "the perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common: information architecture, technical architecture, process architecture. The various parts (functions, concepts and processes) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures. It pre-structures other architectures. Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design. We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study."&lt;ref name="GHV 2006"&gt;Versteeg, G &amp; H. Bouwman. "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT." ''Information Systems Frontiers'' 8 (2006) pp. 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010s ==
[[File:EtomLevel0.png|thumb|360px|[[Business Process Framework (eTOM)]], Level 0 overview of the eTOM processes, 2010.]]

=== Handbooks ===
In the 2010 the first handbooks on Business architecture were published. In the US William M. Ulrich and Neal McWhorter of the OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group published the "Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Business Transformation," in 2010.

In 2012 in Britain the business consultants Jonathan Whelan and Graham Meaden published their "Business Architecture: A Practical Guide."&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"&gt;Meaden &amp; Whelan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
In several sources in the exact definition of "business architecture" is under review. InN 2008 Jeff Scott had commented in this matter: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Interest in business architecture is growing dramatically. During the past two years both IT and business leaders have joined the discussion about the need for a well-defined business architecture. Though there is a great deal of discussion, there is little consensus about what business architecture is, how it should be pursued, and what value it delivers. Business architects in IT as well as in the business have started developing business-unit-wide and enterprise-wide business architectures, learning as they go. Their ultimate goals are to improve business decision-making and facilitate better alignment between IT and the business units it supports. Architecture teams that want to play a leading role in business architecture development must start soon or be left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Scott (2008), ''Business Architecture’s Time Has Come,'' Forrester Publication. (summary at ''forrester.com'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sources came to the same conclusion, that over the years many different definitions of business architecture have been proposed&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittle &amp; Myrick (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerrie Holley, Ali Arsanjani. ''100 SOA Questions: Asked and Answered,'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Malik, "[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickmalik/archive/2012/09/11/many-flawed-definitions-of-business-architecture.aspx Many (flawed) Definitions of Business Architecture]," ''blogs.msdn.com,'' 11 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable definitions have described business architecture as: 
:* "A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands" - [[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]], 2008&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"&gt;[[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]]. "Business Architecture Working Group," at ''bawg.omg.org,'' Oct 10, 2008.  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081006052814/http://bawg.omg.org/ archive.org, Oct. 10, 2008]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes information, as well as the interaction between these concepts." - TOGAF, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[[The Open Group]]. ''TOGAF™ Version 9 Foundation Study Guide,'' 2009, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The formal representation and active management of business design." - SOA Consortium, EA2010 Working group on Business Architecture, 2010&lt;ref name="SC 2010"&gt;SOA Consortium, EA2010 working group. ''[http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf Business Architecture; The Missing Link between Business Strategy and Enterprise Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130051908/http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}.'' Copyright by OMG, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion kept going. [[John Zachman]] (2012) declared in this matter, that "a lot of people define business architecture differently (I know a lot of people who have a lot of different opinions and definitions for business architecture). Not too many people do business architecture, at least not in a comprehensive and definitive fashion (in my estimation)..."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;!--
=== Approaches ===
--&gt;

== Roots in various academic domains ==
Ideas and definitions about business architecture originate from different academic sub disciplines, where the concept of business architecture and methods and techniques are developing in numerous initiatives. A selection of related subfields:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
:* [[Organizational theory]] inspired by [[systems thinking]], [[cybernetics]], [[complexity science]], etc.
:* [[Systems analysis]] and [[Systems design|design]], [[system engineering]], [[business engineering]], [[business modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]]&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; etc.
:* [[Software engineering]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[information technology management]], etc.
:* [[Enterprise architecture]], [[enterprise engineering]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise modeling]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise ontology]], [[enterprise resource planning]], etc.

== Field of practice ==
Guitarte (2013) stipulated, that also different types of organizations have been active, and created a so-called "business architecture vortex.” He listed four types:

:* Influencers: Academe, Various authors, [[Cutter Consortium|Cutter]], [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], Media, [[Gartner]], IIR
:* Third-party vendors: Metastorm, [[IBM]], [[Sparx Systems|Sparx]], [[Troux Technologies|Troux]], [[MEGA International Srl.|Mega]], BrainstormCentral, Pega, BAI, [[Business Process Management Initiative|BPMI]], Progress
:* Communities of practice: [[Business Architecture Guild]], Business Architecture Society, BAA, BizArchCommunity, BAA, IIBA, [[Project Management Institute|PMI]], AOGEA
:* Standards-setting bodies: [[ISO]], BPMN, [[Object Management Group|OMG]], MDA, BASIG, [[The Open Group]], [[TOGAF]], BPM/SOA, BEI&lt;ref name="AG 2013"&gt;Andrew Guitarte, "[http://www.buildingbusinesscapability.com/presentations/2013/1252.pdf Business Architecture Trends &amp; Methods]." (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Guitarte commented, that "influencers led followed by communities of practice and standards-setting bodies; vendors followed. Conflicting ideas provide opportunity to define the future of business architecture profession."&lt;ref name="AG 2013"/&gt;

== Management interests ==
Surveys have reported a growing interest of management in business architecture, as well as on universities:
* In 2004 [[Jaap Schekkerman]] already suggested that "Enterprise Architecture was ranked near the top of the list of most important issues considered by CEO’s and CIO’s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaap Schekkerman]], ''How to Survive in the Jungle of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks: Creating Or Choosing an Enterprise Architecture Framework,'' 2004. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15266">'''IBM Operational Decision Manager''' ('''ODM''') is IBM's Business Rule Management System (BRMS). IBM ODM also incorporates IBM's implementation of Business Event Processing capabilities (also called Complex Event '''Processing''', or [[Complex event processing|CEP]].)

IBM ODM can be installed both independently and as an application running on [[WebSphere Application Server]].

This software is currently in V8.9.

==Business rules and events==

===Rules===
A ''business rule'' is a statement of logic that is used for a business decision to be made. This statement of logic is generally part of a business policy. Rules processing involves a piece of software using this pre-defined rule to make a real-time decision.

==== Example ====
A policy states that a borrower's initial loan must not exceed 3 times their annual salary.
The Business Rule would read:&lt;br /&gt;
''if Loan &gt; (Salary * 3) then disallow.''

===Events===
A business event is a signal or collection of signals indicating that a change in state has occurred, and consists of a small message. Event processing involves using events to determine if an action needs to occur as a result, and carrying out that action.

==== Example ====
''If a customer's withdrawal event on their account causes the balance to drop below zero, then an action is taken to notify that customer.''

==Artifacts of IBM ODM==
IBM ODM is an implementation of a Business Rule Management System. It allows the creation, management, testing and governance of business rules and events and stores them in a central repository where they can be accessed by multiple individuals and software products. This central storage of the rules and events mean that they can be easily modified without having to rebuild software, and with a reduced testing cycle, and the different software products will pick up this change simultaneously.

===Action rules===
A basic rule expressed in a logical form, stating that if a condition occurs then an action should result. IBM ODM uses Business Action Language (BAL) to define such rules, allowing them to be viewed in a more 'natural' language.

==== Examples ====

If a credit card transaction occurs outside a customer's country, then that customer should be called to confirm the card is not being used fraudulently.&lt;br /&gt;
''If Country of Card Usage is not equal to Customer's home country then trigger the sending of a message to call that customer.''

At a bank some customers are not allowed to become overdrawn and some are:&lt;br /&gt;
''If a customer tries to withdraw funds allowing their account to drop below $0 and they are allowed:&lt;br /&gt;
:permit transaction
otherwise:&lt;br /&gt;
:disallow transaction''

===Decision tables===
[[Decision table]]

==== Example ====

A loan company determines the insurance rate of a loan depending on the amount, and the credit rating of the customer.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || Amount Loan ($)|| 
|-
| Credit Rating Group || Min / Max || Insurance Rate (%)
|-
| A || Loan &lt; 100,000 || 0.001
|-
| || 100,000 &lt;= Loan &lt; 200,000 || 0.002
|-
| || 200,000 &lt;= Loan &lt; 300,000 || 0.003
|-
| || 300,000 &lt;= Loan || 0.005
|-
| B || Loan &lt; 200,000 || 0.001
|-
| || 200,000 &lt;= Loan &lt; 300,000 || 0.002
|-
| || 300,000 &lt;= Loan || 0.004
|}

Presented with a customer in group B asking for a loan of $250,000, the rule would indicate the insurance rate should be 0.002%.

===Rule flows===
These indicate the order in which rules should be executed.

==== Example ====

An insurance company wants to establish whether a driver should be given a particular insurance policy. 
The decision depends on:

The age of the applicant&lt;br /&gt;
Whether their history indicates they are a high risk driver, based on speeding tickets and past accidents.&lt;br /&gt;
A profile score of that customer, based on how recently they have passed their test and other factors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether a particular rule is run is dependent on answers to previous rules.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''A rule flow is constructed, from a start node to the different rules that must be considered and finishing at the end node.''

[[File:IBM Operational Decision Management Example Flow diagram.jpg|thumb|center|Illustration of a basic Flow]]

===Score card===
This is a statistical model that applies a numerical score to an object, such as a customer or an account. The same attributes are applied when calculating this score for each item.&lt;br /&gt;
An example of this is a [[Credit scorecards]].

==== Example ====

A score is allocated to a borrower depending on their Age, Citizenship and Credit grade.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attribute !! Range !! Score !! Expected Score !! Reason code 
|-
| Credit Grade || AA || 100 || 90 || 
|-
| || A || 90 || 90 || 
|-
| || B || 70 || 90 || 
|-
| || C || 40 || 90 || CREDIT_C
|-
| || CC || 10 || 90 || CREDIT CC
|-
| Self Employed || Yes || 10 || 30 || Self-employed
|-
| || No || 30 || 30 || 
|}

===Events===
If a specific change in state occurs then a message is emitted causing an event to occur.

====Example====
At a bank some customers are not allowed to become overdrawn and some are. A customer who has tried to take out a loan is refused by the system because their credit rating is too low.&lt;br /&gt;
''If customer is refused, emit an event causing a message to be sent to the user informing them that they have been refused in indicating the reason.''

===In summary===
Combining Business Rules and Events within the same system brings together two complementary technologies to automate real-time decisions. An event may trigger a rule to be run, conversely the outcome of a decision made by a rule may emit an event.

==Components==
IBM ODM consists of the following parts:

===Decision center===
This provides a repository and management component for the creation and maintenance of decision logic, guiding the business system's behavior. It is the central hub for the coordination of the decision life cycle, covering both business rules and business events, and allowing editing of each. &lt;br /&gt;
It is presented in different ways depending on how the user is intended to view the system.&lt;br /&gt;
''Business Console'', for collaboratively working with business rules.&lt;br /&gt;
''Enterprise Console''.

===Decision server===
This consists of the runtime components for business rules and business events.

====Decision server rules====
This provides a group of tools for construction and running of rules and automated decisions. Various components give access for different types of users, allowing the design, authoring, review, testing and running of business rules. This includes the '''Rules Designer''', an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based application for developing applications in Decision Server Rules.

====Decision server events====
This provides an integrated set of components for running events. Various components give access for different types of users, allowing the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of business events. This includes the '''Events Designer''', an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based application for developing applications in Decision Server Events.

===Connection between parts===
Rules can be defined in the Decision Center and can also be updated there, using a variety of interfaces, including the Enterprise Console, Business Console. Rules are then stored in a Repository which manages the Decision Artifacts, access and control and versioning. From here the rules are deployed to the Decision Server, which executes these rules, and provides monitoring and measuring facilities. Rules can also be deployed direct to the Decision Server using the Rule Designer or Event Designer.

[[File:Company Information Session in Japan 003.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Job fair]] for new university graduates in [[Japan]].  See "[[Simultaneous recruiting of new graduates]]".]]
'''Job hunting''', '''job seeking''', or '''job searching''' is the act of looking for [[employment]], due to [[unemployment]], [[underemployment]], discontent with a current position, or a desire for a better position. The immediate goal of job seeking is usually to obtain a [[job interview]] with an [[employer]] which may lead to getting [[Recruitment|hired]]. The job hunter or seeker typically first looks for job vacancies or employment opportunities.

== Steps ==

Local libraries and career centers have resources to aid in job searches. These resources come in multiple formats such as books or online databases and having the right tools can streamline the process make the job-hunt less stressful. 

===Locating jobs ===
Common methods of job hunting are:

* Finding a job through a friend or an extended [[Business networking|business network]], [[Personal Network|personal network]], or [[social media]]
* Using an [[employment website]]
* Job listing search engines
* Looking through the [[Classified advertising|classifieds]] in [[newspaper]]s
* Using a private or public [[employment agency]] or [[recruiter]]
* Looking on a company's web site for open jobs, typically in its [[applicant tracking system]]
* Going to a [[job fair]]
* Using professional guidance such as [[outplacement]] services that give training in writing a résumé, applying for jobs and how to be successful at interview.
* Visiting an organization to find out whether it is recruiting staff or will be doing so in the near future.

As of 2010, less than 10% of U.S. jobs are filled through online ads.&lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, David.  "The dangers of online job hunting".  ''Boston Metro'', 13 September 2010, p. 16.  References uncited studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the employers===

Many job seekers research the employers to which they are applying, and some employers see evidence of this as a positive sign of enthusiasm for the position or the company, or as a mark of thoroughness.  Information collected might include open positions, full name, locations, web site, business description, year established, revenues, number of employees, stock price if public, name of chief executive officer, major products or services, major competitors, and strengths and weaknesses.

===Networking===
Contacting as many people as possible is a highly effective way to find a job. It is estimated that 50% or higher of all jobs are found through networking.&lt;ref name = "Vilorio"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last = Vilorio
  | first = Dennis
  | title = Focused jobseeking: A measured approach to looking for work
  | journal = Occupational Outlook Quarterly
  | date = Spring 2011 
  | url = https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2011/spring/art01.pdf
  | accessdate = 2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Job recruiters and decision makers are increasingly using online social networking sites to gather information about job applicants, according to a mid-2011 Jobvite survey of 800 employers in the US.&lt;ref name = "Survey"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Social Recruiting Survey 2011 
  | work = Jobvite
  | url = http://web.jobvite.com/SocialRecruitingSurvey2011.html
  | accessdate = 2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, job seekers are beginning to use social networking sites to advertise their skills and post resumes. Today, job seekers can use resources such as Google+’s Circles, Facebook’s BranchOut, LinkedIn’s InMaps, and Twitter’s Lists to make employers notice them in a unique way.&lt;ref name = "repA"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Schepp
  | first = Brad
  | title = How to Find a Job on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Google+
  | publisher = McGraw-Hill 
  | year = 2012
  | url = http://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf
  | accessdate = 2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, using these social media networks has led to 1 of 6 job seekers finding employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Job Search|url=http://omba.wsu.edu/resources/infographics/digital-job-search/|website=Washington State University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Job seekers need to begin to pay more attention to what employers and recruiters find when they do their pre-interview information gathering about applicants, according to this 2010 study by [[Microsoft]], "Online Reputation in a Connected World".&lt;ref name = "repB"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Online Reputation in a Connected World

  | url = http://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf
  | accessdate = 2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applying ===
One can also go and hand out [[résumé]]s or [[résumé|Curricula Vitae]] to prospective employers, in the hope that they are recruiting for staff or could soon be doing so. [[Résumé]]s can also be submitted to online employment sites that aid in job searching. Another recommended method of job hunting is [[cold calling]] and, since the 1990s, [[email]]ing companies that one desires to work for and inquire to whether there are any job vacancies.

After finding a desirable job, they would then apply for the job by responding to the advertisement. This may mean applying through a website, emailing or mailing in a hard copy of a résumé to a prospective employer. It is generally recommended that résumés be brief, organized, concise, and targeted to the position being sought. With certain occupations, such as [[graphic design]] or [[writer|writing]], portfolios of a job seeker's previous work are essential and are evaluated as much, if not more than the person's résumé.  In most other occupations, the résumé should focus on past accomplishments, expressed in terms as concretely as possible (e.g. number of people managed, amount of increased sales or improved customer satisfaction).

Since the year 2000, the Internet has been increasingly popular method for job applications, with many companies giving job applicants the option of applying through their company website, while some companies now have no alternative form of recruitment.

=== Interviewing ===
{{main | Job interview}}
Once an employer has received résumés, they will make a list of potential employees to be interviewed based on the résumé and any other information contributed. During the interview process, interviewers generally look for persons who they believe will be best for the job and work environment. The interview may occur in several rounds until the interviewer is satisfied and offers the job to the applicant.

==Job hunting in economic theory==
Economists use the term "[[frictional unemployment]]" to mean unemployment resulting from the time and effort that must be expended before an appropriate job is found. This type of unemployment is always present in the economy.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frictionalunemployment.asp#axzz21f6MnzBV |title= Frictional Unemployment|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Search theory]] is the economic theory that studies the optimal decision of how much time and effort to spend searching, and which offers to accept or reject (in the context of a job hunt, or likewise in other contexts like searching for a low price).

'''Jules–Auguste Lair''' (25 May 1836 – 16 May 1907) was a French lawyer, businessman and scholar. 
At the [[École des Chartes]] he studied palaeography, and was offered a position with the Archives, but he decided instead to became a lawyer. 
At the age of 25 he became director of a warehousing company, and over the next forty years was involved in various major enterprises including the first telephone network in France.
At the same time, he always set aside time for historical work, and published many articles and books on aspects of French history from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[French Revolution]].

==Life==
===Early years===

Jules-Auguste Lair was born in [[Caen]] on 25 May 1836.{{sfn|Jules Lair (1836–1907) – BnF}}
His family was prosperous.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=6}} 
His father, a trader in butter, died while he was a child.
He studied at the Collège Royal de Caen{{efn|Collège Royal de Caen: now the [[Lycée Malherbe]]}}, where he was a brilliant pupil.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=537}}
He then moved to Paris where he attended the [[École des Chartes]] and studied archival palaeography{{efn|Archival [[palaeography]]: This involves deciphering old scripts held in the archives, transferring them into modern writing systems, dating the texts, identifying where they were written, cataloguing and annotating them.}}.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=7}}
He entered the École des Chartes in the autumn of 1855, and graduated first in 1858, ahead of Siméon Luce.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=538}}

Lair was offered a position with the Archives, but chose to follow a career as a lawyer.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=7}}
He earned a doctorate from the Faculty of Law in Paris in 1859.{{sfn|Jules Lair (1836–1907) – BnF}}
He enrolled at the Bar of Paris, where he pleaded some cases.
During the 1860–61 judicial year he was one of the secretaries of the [[Conférence des avocats du barreau de Paris]].{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=538}}
He entered the office of Sébastien Joseph Boulatignier&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Sébastien Joseph Boulatignier|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;, President of the litigation section in the Council of State.
He also worked for Antoine Blanche, Advocate General at the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]].{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=7}}

===Businessman===

In 1860, at the age of 25 Lair accepted the job of deputy director of the new Compagnie des Entrepôts et Magasins généraux de Paris (Paris Warehouse and General Stores Company) under M. Moranvillé, a friend of Boulatignier.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=542}}{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=8}}
The company was formed from assets of the failed Docks Napoléon.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=8}}{{efn|The Docks Napoleon had been founded at the start of the [[Second French Empire]] to manage large warehouses where goods shipped to Parisian tradesmen or industrialists by canal or railway could be stored until needed.
The concept was good, but bad management, and perhaps dishonesty, caused the company to fail.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=541}} }}
Lair was in charge of litigation.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=8}}
By 1870 the company was well organized, financially secure and doing more business than had been foreseen for the original Docks Napoléon.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=543}}

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in 1870.
Lair became a captain in the staff of [[Louis-Jules Trochu|General Trochu]] in the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=8}}
He was awarded the Cross of the [[Legion of Honour]] by decree of 30 January 1871.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=574}}
During the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871 the warehouses in the [[La Villette, Seine|Villette]] and Pont de Flandre&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Quartier du Pont-de-Flandre|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; quarters were occupied by the most fervent partisans of the Commune, and burned down.
After the disaster Moranvillé and Lair managed to raise funds to rebuild,  which they achieved within two year.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=543}}
In 1873 Moranvillé retired and Lair became director of the company. 
He would hold this position for 33 years.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=544}}
In 1873 he married a Mlle Dehaussy, from a family that was always interested in intellectual pursuits and particularly the arts.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=550}}

[[File:T5- d591 - Fig. 474. — Le bureau central de la Villette.png|thumb|Central office of the Société générale des téléphones in [[La Villette, Seine|La Villette]], Paris, 1891]]
Lair bought the Magasins Généraux d'Auhervilliers et de Saint-Denis, doubling the size of the enterprise.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=9}}
In 1881, after the first telephony experiments, Lair conceived the great project of organizing a telephone network in France.
Jules Lair organized the Société générale des Téléphones&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Société industrielle des téléphones|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; in 1881, which was taken over by the state in 1889.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=11}} 
[[Lazare Weiller]] collaborated with Lair in manufacturing and distributing telephones.{{sfn|Jolly|1960–1977}}
Lair was also interested in underwater telegraphy, and wanted to create a network of submarine cable connecting France to her colonies.
The army and navy strongly supported this, but it did not achieve all its goals due to opposition from the Deputy of [[Le Havre]].{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=11}} 
Lair entered into various other enterprises associated with the [[Crédit Industriel et Commercial]].{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=11}}
His senior management positions in addition to running the Magasins généraux included:{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=545}}
*President of the Société générale des téléphones, 1881–89
*President of the Comptoir des entrepôts, 1891
*President of the Compagnie française des télégraphes sous-marins, 1898
*Vice-President of the Crédit industriel, 1895
*President of the Société des mines de Czeladz, 1897
*Vice-President of the Société française des métaux, 1899
*President of the Société des docks de Rouen, 1902
*President of the Société des aciéries de France, 1902

===Literary work===
[[File:Louise de La Vallière and the early life of Louis XIV (1908) (14577748040).jpg|thumb|[[Louise de La Vallière]], illustration from ''Louise de La Vallière et la jeunesse de Louis XIV d'après des documents inédits'' (1907 edition) ]]
Throughout his business career, Lair always set aside time for historical work.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=12ff}}
He was particularly interested in the history of his native [[Normandy]].{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=548}}
In 1860 he published a History of the Parliament of Normandy from its translation to Caen in June 1589 until its return to Rouen in April 1594.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=12ff}}
The first volume of his ''Étude sur les origines de l'évêché de Bayeux'' (1862) prompted a lengthy rebuttal by the Abbé L. Tapin, also published in 1862.{{sfn|Tapin|1862|p=6}}
He published a new edition of [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]]'s History of the Normans which was published in Caen under the title ''De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum'' in the memoirs of the Société des Antiquaires de Normandie.
His long preface tried to establish that Dudo was a reliable historical source, which he was not, and the text has been criticized for careless collation and transcription. 
However, it has not been superseded.{{sfn|Dudo of St. Quentin|Christiansen|1998|p=xxxv}}

As a personal gift General Trochu gave Lair a collection of letters written from abroad during the [[French Revolution]] about the events of that period, which Lair began publishing from 1872 with the help of Émile Legrand&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Émile Legrand|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=9}}
Lair's father-in-law had a country house in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]], in the [[Vallée de Chevreuse]], and this became an important retreat for Lair whan he could find time away from business.
He wrote an engaging history of the village of Bures.{{sfn|Perrot|1907|p=554}}
While dealing with financiers and competitors, he wrote studies of such people as [[Louise de La Vallière]], [[Nicolas Fouquet]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]].{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=9}}
He continued to publish diverse works on aspects of the Middle Ages, the Sun King and the French Revolution.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=12ff}}
He always remained linked to Caen as a member of the Société des Antiquaires de Normandie, while in Paris he was an active member of the Société de l'École des Chartes.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=7}}

Lair died in [[Paris]] on 16 May 1907.{{sfn|Jules Lair (1836–1907) – BnF}}
At the time of his death from bronchitis he was working on the ''Mémoires de Richelieu''.{{sfn|Passy|1907|p=12ff}}

In December 2009, [[United Airlines]] expressed interest in using the CS100 and CS300 for replacing its aging 737–300 and 737-500 aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/2009/12/10/united-to-consider-bombardier-cseries/ |title= United to consider Bombardier CSeries |work= Boeing and aerospace news |publisher= Seattle PI |date= 10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a future order is unlikely as airline has made orders for the [[Airbus A319]]-100 and the [[Boeing 737]]-800.

In March 2010, [[easyJet]] stated that the company was having "ongoing discussions with Bombardier regarding its CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |title=Airbus Weighs Costs, Rivals’ Advances in Engine Upgrade Choice |work=Businessweek |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326182513/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the airline has since ordered the Airbus A320-200 and A320neo.

In March 2018, it was stated that Garuda Indonesia wanted to order the CS300 as a replacement for the Bombardier CRJ-1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviatren.com/2018/03/10/garuda-indonesia-ganti-atr72-dan-crj1000-dengan-bombardier-cs300/|title=Garuda Indonesia Ganti ATR72 dan CRJ1000 dengan Bombardier CS300?trans-title=Garuda Indonesia to replace ATR72 and CRJ1000 with Bombardier CS300?|date=March 10, 2018|access-date=8 May 2018|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''live fish trade''' can refer to the live [[food fish]] trade (for human consumption) or to the [[ornamental fish]] trade (for [[aquarium]]s).  The [[fish]] can come from many places, but most comes from [[Southeast Asia]].

The live food fish trade is a global system that links [[fishing]] communities with markets, primarily in [[Hong Kong]] and mainland [[China]].  Many of the fish are captured on [[coral reef]]s in Southeast Asia or the [[Pacific Island]] nations.

== Consumer demand ==
[[File:Korea-Tongyeong-Jungang Live Fish Market-02.jpg|thumb|right|Live [[fish market]] in [[Tongyeong]], Korea]]

Within the live food trade there are certain types of fish demanded more often by consumers, particularly smaller and medium-sized fish. According to the book While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade consumer demand has caused the fish captured on coral reefs to be the most valued fish in the trade. Consumers are important because they are directly purchasing these fish species at restaurants and stores. In addition to these types of fishes, many juvenile fish are used for the live food trade. There are also cultural and regional preferences among consumers, for example, Chinese consumers often prefer their fish to be reddish in color believing the color to be auspicious.&lt;ref&gt;Sadovy, Y.T, Ecological Issues and the Trades in Live Reef fishes chapter 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These preferences inevitably affect the biodiversity of marine life making certain fish species rarer to find.

The life fish food trade is a lucrative business. According to [[University of Washington]] Professor Patrick Christie, live fish caught for food export earns approximately $6000 a ton.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Patrick John. University of Washington Professor in School of Marine Affairs. Lecture 5/9/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; To help support themselves and their families, fishermen in [[Oceania]] and [[Southeast Asia]] sometimes use illegal fishing methods. Although many feel the fish are worth the cost, a typical dinner can cost up to one hundred dollars per [[kilogram]]. The wholesale value on these fish is anywhere from eleven US dollars to sixty-three US dollars per kilogram, meaning there’s a large markup and resale value. ([[Hong Kong]] alone is estimated to be about four hundred million US dollars a year.) Because this trade frequently uses illegal methods of collecting (using [[cyanide]]), there is no way to know for sure how much money is being made each year on live fish trade, although estimates conclude probably over one billion US dollars each year.

As is often the case, consumers are willing to pay large amounts of money on rare and fresh fish. One 500-pound, polka-dot [[grouper]], estimated to be more than a century old, was hacked into fillets by seven kitchen workers in about half an hour, the Economist reports. It was expected to bring about $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Moll, David. "A Good Time for a Fishing Expedition." ''Journal Star Peoria'' [Illinois] 29 May 1996: C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market and trade routes ==

The center for the Live Food Fish Trade is located in Hong Kong -- the markets consumers contribute $400 million to the estimated $1 billion of the trades global value.&lt;ref&gt;SeaWeb.

[http://library.enaca.org/Grouper/Publications/eMagazine2.pdf Marine Finfish Markets in Hong Kong.] July-Sept 2004. 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other major markets include [[Singapore]], mainland China, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Thomas.

May 24 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary suppliers of wild caught fish are Indonesia (accounting for nearly 50 percent of Hong Kong's imports), Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; However, Taiwan and Malaysia are leading the charge towards farmed live fish specializing in an industry that "harvested annually has probably been in the billions [Metric Tons]".&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; Farming live fish is gaining popularity as tastes for live fish are burgeoning across South Asia and countries look to become more and more self sustainable, this is appareant in nations with sizable [[Chinese race|Chinese populations]] such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

Hong Kong and China are the dominant markets for the live fish, in addition to other cities in the region that have large Chinese populations, including Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;"Coral reef populations severely depleted by trade." ''BusinessWorld'' (Manila). 11 Nov 1999: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Southeast Asia, Singapore alone consumes 500 tons of live coral fish a year.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; Exports from Southeast Asia rose to over 5,000 tons in 1995 from 400 tons in 1989.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; However, in 1996, exports declined by 22%.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; Indonesia, which accounts for over 60% of the harvest, saw exports falling by over 450 tons.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; That same year, other Southeast Asian countries have experienced similar drops in stocks of live coral fish for food.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; In 1996, the Philippines' exports were halved, while Malaysian exports declined by over 30%.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; These decreases in catch have been due to the excessive amount of fish caught for exports and the degradation of the coral reefs from such procedures.

== Corruption in the trade ==
[[File:Hedda turning into Kinlochbervie Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 1113949.jpg|thumb|right|The "wellboat", or live fish carrier, ''Hedda'', turning into [[Kinlochbervie]] Harbour, Scotland]]

The live fish trade is a complex issue that involves many different perspectives, all of which must be considered in trying to approach a solution. While, at first, one may point the finger at the fishermen themselves as the criminals, there are many other factors. One is the economic disparity of many of the communities that take part in cyanide, dynamite, or other illegal fishing practices. 40% of the Filipino population and 27% of the Indonesian population is considered to be in [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ The World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; Many whose livelihood once depended on [[fishing]] or [[agriculture]] are realizing it is more lucrative to participate in illegal fishing activities.

Community members who are not a part of the trade are affected by the activities of these illegal fishers. The cyanide fishers profit by taking away from everyone else’s trade and food.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;Lowe, Celia “Who is to blame? Logics of responsibility in the live reef food fish trade in Sulawesi, Indonesia” SPC Live Reef Fish Information Bulletin #10 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ‘''If people were using poison and my take dropped to only a little, I would accept it'',’ Puah said. ‘''But I feel heartsick…I catch nothing at all. I have not caught a big fish in a month so there’s no point in going fishing this afternoon''.’”&lt;ref name="Lowe"/&gt; The local people are often helpless to protect themselves, as government and law enforcement officials have “open pockets” and are also involved in the trade by turning a blind eye to the illegal actions and receiving a take of the profits. “Culpability in cyanide use cannot be understood apart from the larger structures of corruption that permeates resource extraction throughout Indonesia. The Indonesian State [[bureaucracy]] extends from Jakarta down to the village level, and radiates out into villages through kinship connections. It is the factor most tightly correlated with illegal trade in natural resources throughout Indonesia.”&lt;ref name="Lowe"/&gt;

== Cause and effect ==
Coral reefs found in the South Pacific are regarded as the "rainforest of the sea" harboring countless fish species large and small.  However, recently the live fish trade has threatened the sanctity of these endangered areas.  The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has issued a recent report that estimates that 25% of the world's reefs are severely damaged and another third are in grave danger.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, Franklin and Best, Barbara. "Coral Reef Crisis: Causes and Consequences." May 24 2005 {{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/international |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528070837/http://www.aaas.org/international/ |archivedate=2005-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The live fish trade is part of this alarming ecological trend caused by the popular use of cyanide which is injected into the coral reefs to stun inhabiting fish so they can be easily caught by nets.  It is estimated that since the 1960s, more than one million kilograms of cyanide has been squirted into Philippine reefs alone, and since then the practice has spread throughout the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; The live fish trade is only growing, in 1994 the Philippines exported 200,000&amp;nbsp;kg of live fish; by 2004 the Philippines were annually exporting 800,000&amp;nbsp;kg annually.&lt;ref&gt;Aguiba, Melody M. "12 August 2004 Depletion of live fish trade for export feared." May 24 2005 [http://www.earthdrive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Asian markets are the primary buyers of live reef fish for food, the recently created U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has concluded that the U.S. is the primary purchaser of live reef fish for aquariums as well as eclectic jewelry.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; Even though the use of cyanide in the live fish trade is severely detrimental, one must realize that this issue is multidimensional. Small-scale native fishermen of the small South Pacific coastal communities are the backbone of the live fish trade, and are forced to resort to the illegal use of sodium cyanide due to demand and high prices offered by the industry.

== Fishing techniques ==
While live food fish trade can be very profitable for those involved, there are many dangerous aspects to it.  Through the use of illegal practices such as cyanide fishing, coral reefs and fish communities are put in grave danger.  The process of cyanide fishing involves dissolving crushed cyanide tablets and squirting this solution from a bottle toward the targeted fish on top of coral heads. Specifically, the cyanide kills coral polyps, symbiotic algae, and other coral reefs organisms that are necessary for maintaining the health of the coral reef.  These damages eventually deteriorate the coral reef and lead it into collapse of the entire coral reef ecosystem.  The effect on the targeted fish is disorientation and semi-paralysis.  After being squirted with cyanide, the fish are easy brought to the surface and kept alive in small, on-board containers.  Fishermen often understand that this practice is harmful and will offer locals a portion of the fish in order to continue fishing.  When ingested, small levels of cyanide accumulate in the system causing weakness of fingers and toes, failure of the thyroid gland and blurred vision.  Divers without experience may come in direct contact with cyanide, causing death.  Estimates show that since the 1960s, over a million kilograms of cyanide have been squirted into the coral reefs of the Philippines alone.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D., L. Burke, J. McManus, and M. Spalding. 1998. Reefs at risk: A map-based indicator of threats to the world's coral reefs. World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The harm upon the reefs is coming full circle and having a social impact through the limited fish stocks.  As fish are depleted from these fishing techniques, the fishermen are having a more difficult time feeding themselves.&lt;ref name="panda"&gt;[http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/features/news.cfm?uNewsID=5563 "Cyanide: an Easy but Deadly Way to Catch Fish."] 29 Jan. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the use of explosives may be used as a fishing technique in the live food fish trade.  While the majority of these fish do not survive the blast of such explosions, the remaining fish that are only stunned are collected for the live food fish trade.  The use of cyanide makes a stronger argument in that the more coral reef fish captured alive, the more lucrative the catch is for the fisherman.  Live fish, according to the [WWF], fetch five times more than a dead fish.&lt;ref name="panda"/&gt; This is why banning the live-fish trade would similarly harm the reefs.  Fisherman would resort to the "dead fish trade", be forced to deal in a larger quantity of fish, and the process of dangerous fishing techniques continues.  To illustrate the effects of repeated explosions in the proximity of a coral reef system, roughly one half of the coral reefs in Komodo National Park in Indonesia have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; The use of cyanide and explosives in fishing proves to be an effective technique in catching fish, but its powers are indiscriminating and as a result the coral reefs are being held hostage to such practices.  The future of the reefs are in question just as are the futures of those who subsist from them because "from a long term perspective, the question of ethics of using the ocean...contains a commitment for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Grover, Velma I.,  Ed.  ''Climate Change Five Years After Kyoto.''  Enfield: Science Publishers Inc., 2004, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts on humans ==

In communities like those in the Philippines and Indonesia, people are participating in the live food fish trade because it is a source of income, or at least a source of temporary income. For some communities this is one of the few income-generating opportunities.  Along with the environmental, ecological, and economic consequences of this industry, there are serious health risks as well.  Because of inadequate training and lack of quality equipment, divers, especially young men are in large risk of paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, T.J.; Graham, T.R.; McGilvray, G.J.; Phillips, M.J.; Rimmer, M.A.; Sadovy, Y.J.; Smith, A; and Yeeting, B.  “While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade.” Asian Development Bank.  2003.  {{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Live_Reef_Food_Fish_Trade/62289_summary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305043652/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Live_Reef_Food_Fish_Trade/62289_summary.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable practices ==

Because of the great profitability of this industry, there is a great incentive to identify sustainable practices.  The [[Marine Aquarium Council]] (MAC) works to offer the hobbyist with a product that is certified as environmentally sound and sustainable.  Additionally, the International Marinelife Alliance (IMA), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and MAC are working with the Hong Kong Chamber of Seafood Merchants to develop standards for the live fish trade. The Hong Kong Seafood Merchants represent ninety percent of the buyers of live reef food fish in Hong Kong and have an extensive impact on collection practices.

== Aquaculture ==
[[File:Geocrab Hatchery - geograph.org.uk - 1633447.jpg|thumb|right|A [[fish hatchery]] at [[Loch an Eilein]], Scotland, which exports young salmon via a live fish carrying ship that comes into the bay. The fish are taken to [[Aquaculture of salmon#Sea cages|sea cages]] where they are grown on.]]

In an effort to address the damage inflicted on coral reef eco-systems and fish stocks, aquaculture is being utilized to reduce pressure on coral reefs. However, initial efforts to farm grouper have met with significant challenges. There are difficulties with fragile grouper seed that can make it more expensive than wild caught larvae, which can affect natural replenishment rates. Additionally, there are problems with finding suitable food, disease and cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes, R.E. and N.J. Ogburn, “Collecting grouper seed for aquaculture in the Philippines.” Available from [http://www.spc.int/coastfish/News/LRF/6/07-JohannesOgburn.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts are also being made in regards to the aquarium fish trade. Juvenile fish are being captured and raised specifically for the industry.  However, there are debates as to whether this practice will affect replenishment rates. “The age of the juveniles is pivotal to the debate, harvesting of postlarvae from the water column is considered to have a much lower (negligible) impact on rates of replenishment than the removal of the larger juveniles from benthic habitats because the postlarvae have yet to undergo severe mortality”.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Johann, Peter Doherty and Cathy Hair, “The capture and culture of postlarval coral reef fish: Potential for new artisanal fisheries.” Available from  [http://www.spc.int/coastfish/News/LRF/6/05-Bell.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; If studies determine that the capture of juveniles is sustainable, it may help in mitigating the damage from cyanide fishing.

It should also be noted that aquaculture production, specifically grouper rearing is rapidly expanding in Asia.  From 1998 to 2001 the Indo-Pacific countries involved in aquaculture; China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand witnessed a 119 percent increase in output.&lt;ref&gt;FAO fishery Information Data and Statistics Unit 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion in this practice can most likely be attributed to the large profit margins that can be derived in very little time.  It is estimated that the majority of farms after annual returns can be paid back in less than one year.&lt;ref name="Siar"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Susana V. Siar, William Lee Johnston &amp; Sih Yang Sim |year=2002 |title=Study on economics and socio-economics of small-scale marine fish hatcheries and nurseries, with special reference to grouper systems in Bali, Indonesia |id=Report prepared under APEC Project FWG 01/2001 – Collaborative APEC Grouper Research Development Network Publication 02/2001 |location=Bangkok |publisher=Network of Aquaculture Centers in the Asia–Pacific |url=http://www.livefoodfishtrade.org/aquaculture/pdf/Socio_Economics_Small_Scale_Hatcheries.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to other species of fish such as the Milkfish, the Grouper, because of high demand is able to garner high rates of return, in order to earn 1,000 dollars a grouper farm would only have to raise 400 kilograms in contrast to 5,000 kilograms of Milkfish.&lt;ref name="Siar"/&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''long run''' is the conceptual time period in which there are no [[fixed factors of production]], so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the [[Capital (economics)|capital stock]] or by entering or leaving an industry. The long run contrasts with the '''short run''', in which some factors are variable and others are fixed, constraining entry or exit from an industry.  In [[macroeconomics]], the long run is the period when the general [[price level]],  contractual wage rates, and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson and [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', 18th ed., [end] Glossary of Terms, "Long run" and "Short run."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arleen J. Hoag|author2=John H. Hoag|title=Introductory Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2AcaoqC-28C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2006|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-256-891-5|pages=119+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long run==
In the long run, [[business|firm]]s 
change production levels in response to (expected) [[economic profit]]s or losses, and the  [[land (economics)|land]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]] and [[entrepreneurship]] vary to reach the minimum level of long-run [[average cost]]. In the simplified case of plant capacity as the only fixed factor, a generic firm can make these changes in the long run:
* enter an industry in response to (expected) profits
* leave an industry in response to losses
* increase its plant in response to profits
* decrease its plant in response to losses 

The long run is associated with the [[Cost curve#Long-run average cost curve (LRAC)|long-run average cost]] (LRAC) curve in [[microeconomic]] models along which a firm would minimize its [[average cost]] (cost per unit) for each respective long-run quantity of output.  ''[[Long-run marginal cost]]'' (''LRMC'') is the added cost of providing an additional unit of [[Service (economics)|service]] or [[commodity]] from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output. LRMC equalling price is efficient as to [[resource allocation]] in the long run. The concept of ''long-run cost'' is also used in determining whether the long-run expected to induce the firm to remain in the industry or shut down production there. In long-run equilibrium of an industry in which [[perfect competition]] prevails, the LRMC = LRAC at the minimum LRAC and associated output. The shape of the long-run marginal and average costs curves is determined by [[returns to scale]]. 

The long run is a planning and implementation stage.&lt;ref&gt; Melvin &amp; Boyes,  2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"&gt;Boyes, W., 2004. ''The New Managerial Economics'', p. 107. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; Here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line. The firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process. The firm thus considers all its long-run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long-run purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin &amp; Boyes, 2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal combination of inputs is the least-cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable.&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"/&gt; Once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins, the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs.&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Perloff, J, 2008. ''Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus'', p. 230. Pearson .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short run==
All production in real time occurs in the short run.  
In the short run, a [[profit maximization|profit-maximizing]] firm will:
* increase production if [[marginal cost]] is less than [[marginal revenue]] (added revenue per additional unit of output);
* decrease production if [[marginal cost]] is greater than [[marginal revenue]];
* continue producing if [[average variable cost]] is less than [[price]] per unit, even if [[average total cost]] is greater than [[price]];
* shut down if [[average variable cost]] is greater than [[price]] at each level of outputs

==Transition from short run to long run==
The transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short-run equilibrium that is also a long-run equilibrium as to [[supply and demand]], then comparing that state against a new short-run and long-run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs  equilibrium, say in the sales-tax rate,  tracing out the short-run adjustment first, then the long-run adjustment.  Each is an example of [[comparative statics]]. [[Alfred Marshall]] (1890) pioneered in comparative-static period analysis.&lt;ref&gt;• John K. Whitaker, 2008. "Marshall, Alfred (1842–1924)," Price determination and period analysis, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Alfred Marshall, [1890] 1890. [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|''Principles of Economics'']], Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between the temporary or market period (with output fixed), the short period, and the long period.  "Classic" contemporary graphical and formal treatments include those of [[Jacob Viner]] (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Viner, 1931. "Costs Curves and Supply Curves," ''Zeitschrift für Nationalölkonomie'' (''Journal of Economics''), 3, pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/VinerJE.pdf 23-46.]  Reprinted in R. B. Emmett, ed. 2002, ''The Chicago Tradition in Economics, 1892-1945'', Routledge, v. 6, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwhrYnGEYdoC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA192=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 192-] 215.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hicks]] (1939),&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hicks, 1939. ''[[Value and Capital|Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory]]'', Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Samuelson]] (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson, 1947. ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'', Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The law of diminishing marginal r', 5th ed., p.  185.  Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-019673-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The law is related to a positive slope of the [[Cost curve#Short-run marginal cost curve (SRMC)|short-run marginal-cost curve]].&lt;ref&gt;While the law does not directly apply in the long run it is not irrelevant. The long run is the planning phase. A manager deciding which of several plants to build would want to know the shape of the SR cost curves associated with each of these plants. Marginal diminishing returns  are related to the shape of the short-run marginal and average cost curves.  Thus the law indirectly effects long-run decision making per R. Pindyck &amp; D. Rubinfeld, 2001, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., pp. 185-86.  Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomic usages==
The usage of ''long run'' and ''short run'' in [[macroeconomics]] differs somewhat from the above microeconomic usage. [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1936 emphasized fundamental factors of a market economy that might result in prolonged periods away from [[full employment|full-employment]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Panico and Fabio Petri, 2008. "long run and short run," Short- and long-period in Keynes, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000192&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Long%20run&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes, 1936. ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In later macroeconomic usage, the long run is the period in which the [[price level]] for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. In addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] of the economy and full [[Capital (economics)|capital]] mobility between nations. In the short run none of these conditions need fully hold. The price level is [[Sticky (economics)|sticky]] or fixed in response to changes in aggregate demand or supply, capital is not fully mobile between sectors, and capital is not fully mobile across countries due to interest rate differences among countries and fixed exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], 2002. ''Macroeconomics'', 5th ed.  pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PA240=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 240,] [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PR12=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 120], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PA327=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 327–329.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A famous critique of neglecting short-run analysis was by Keynes, who wrote that "In the long run, we are all dead", referring to the long-run proposition of the [[quantity theory of money]], for example, a doubling of the [[money supply]] doubling the [[price level]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Keynes, 1923. ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'', p. 65. Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelson Mandela International Day''' (or '''Mandela Day''') is an annual international day in honour of [[Nelson Mandela]], celebrated each year on 18 July, Mandela's birthday.&lt;ref name="UN18"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/ |title=Nelson Mandela International Day, July 18, For Freedom, Justice and Democracy |first= |last= |work=un.org |year=|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was officially declared by the [[United Nations]] in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/2009/64.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the first UN Mandela Day held on 18 July 2010. However, other groups began celebrating Mandela Day on 18 July 2009.

On 27 April 2009, the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concerts and the [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson Mandela Foundation]] invited the global community to join them in support of an official Mandela Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/the-nelson-mandela-foundation-and-46664-call-for-the-establishment-of-a-glo|title=The Nelson Mandela Foundation and 46664 call for the establishment of a global ‘Mandela Day’ – Nelson Mandela Foundation|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela Day is not meant as a public holiday, but as a day to honour the legacy of [[Nelson Mandela]], South Africa's former President, and his values, through [[volunteering]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref name=UN18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS138319+27-Apr-2009+PRN20090427 |title=46664 and the Nelson Mandela Foundation Call for Establishment of Global 'Mandela... |publisher=Reuters |date= 27 April 2009|accessdate=31 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela Day is a global call to action that celebrates the idea that each individual has the power to [[social change|transform the world]], the ability to make an impact.

The Mandela Day campaign message is:

: "Nelson Mandela has fought for [[social justice]] for 67 years. We're asking you to start with 67 minutes."&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandeladay.com/ |title=Mandela Day |publisher=Mandela Day |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"We would be honoured if such a day can serve to bring together people around the world to [[poverty reduction|fight poverty]] and promote [[peace]], [[resolution of disputes|reconciliation]] and [[cultural diversity]]," according to a statement issued on Mandela's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8021275.stm | work=BBC News | title=World urged to mark 'Mandela Day' | date=27 April 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the first global celebration of Mandela Day on 18 July 2009, Mandela's 91st birthday, a series of educational, art exhibit, fund-raising and volunteer events leading up to a concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 18 July were organised by the 46664 concerts and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"/&gt; In November 2009, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] formally declared 18 July to be "Nelson Mandela International Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8353853.stm|title=UN gives backing to 'Mandela Day' |date=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merton Howard Miller''' (May 16, 1923 – June 3, 2000) was an American economist, and the co-author of the [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]] (1958), which proposed the irrelevance of debt-equity structure. He shared the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1990, along with [[Harry Markowitz]] and [[William F. Sharpe]]. Miller spent most of his academic career at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Booth School of Business]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Miller was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to Jewish parents Sylvia and Joel Miller,&lt;ref name=nndb&gt;{{cite web | title=Merton H. Miller | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/174/000159694/ | work=The Notable Names Database| year=2008 | accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174966865|title=Encyclopedia of American Jewish history|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Norwood, Stephen H. (Stephen Harlan), 1951-, Pollack, Eunice G.|isbn=1851096388|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=174966865}}&lt;/ref&gt; a housewife and attorney. He worked during [[World War II]] as an economist in the division of tax research of the Treasury Department, and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1952. His first academic appointment after receiving his doctorate was Visiting Assistant Lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]].

===Career===
In 1958, at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]), he collaborated with his colleague [[Franco Modigliani]] on the paper ''The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment''. This paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of [[corporate finance]], according to which a corporation can reduce its [[cost of capital]] by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio. According to the [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]], on the other hand, there is no right ratio, so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth, letting the debt ratio chips fall where they will.

The way in which they arrived at this conclusion made use of the "no [[arbitrage]]" argument, i.e. the [[premise]] that any state of affairs that will allow traders of any market instrument to create a riskless money machine will almost immediately disappear. They set the pattern for many arguments based on that premise in subsequent years.

Miller wrote or co-authored eight books. He became a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1975 and was president of the American Finance Association in 1976. He was on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Booth School of Business]] from 1961 until his retirement in 1993, although he continued teaching at the school for several more years.

His works formed the basis of the "Modigliani-Miller Financial Theory".

He served as a public director on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] 1983–85 and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] from 1990 until his death in [[Chicago]] on June 3, 2000. In 1993, Miller waded into the controversy surrounding $2 billion in trading losses by what was characterized as a rogue futures trader at a subsidiary of [[Metallgesellschaft]], arguing in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that management of the subsidiary was to blame for panicking and liquidating the position too early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markham|first1=Jerry W.|title=A Financial History of Modern U.S. Corporate Scandals: From Enron to Reform|date=2006|publisher=M.E.

===Personal life===
Miller was married to Eleanor Miller, who died in  1969.  He was survived by his second wife, Katherine Miller, and by three children from his first marriage: Pamela (1952), Margot (1955), and Louise (1958), and two grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Uchitelle]] (2000).

'''Patrick Corrigan''', [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 9 September 1932), is an Australian businessman, art collector, jazz enthusiast and philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Corrigan was born at Hangkow (now [[Hankou]], part of the city of [[Wuhan]]), central China, to British parents Leonard and Amelie (née Wolnizer) Corrigan. Leonard Corrigan worked for the shipping conglomerate [[Jardine Matheson]], one of the original Hong Kong trading houses or [[Hong (business)|Hongs]].

In 1935 the Corrigan family moved to Tientsin (now [[Tianjin]]), northern China. On 30 July 1937, Tientsin fell to Japan during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but was not occupied entirely as the Japanese continued to respect [[Concessions in Tianjin|foreign concessions]] until 1941, when the United States entered the [[Second World War]]. Following rumours of Japan's imminent entrance into the War, the local British authorities encouraged evacuation of its citizens and the Corrigan family decided to seek refuge in Australia.

Corrigan and his mother were granted a travel permit and left mainland China ahead of his father aboard the SS Fausang,&lt;ref&gt;Ship's history available at ''Clydebuilt database'', [http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=15716] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which was captured in the [[Battle of Hong Kong]] on 8 December 1941, the same day as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Corrigan and his mother subsequently spent four years in the [[Stanley Internment Camp]] during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]]. Corrigan has reflected on his life at this time: &lt;blockquote&gt;the movie ‘[[Empire of the Sun (film)|''Empire of the Sun'']]' almost duplicates my life in the camp. I was the same age as the boy … and we did things that you see in 'Empire of the Sun' … we used to go under the barbed wire and steal vegetables from the Japanese vegetable garden and come back … it's just amazing, it's like watching yourself when you watch that movie.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Early Life" paragraph 21, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Japanese surrender in 1945, they were liberated by Australian Navy [[minesweeper]] personnel. Corrigan's father had also been interred in a POW camp on mainland China, near Beijing, and was liberated after the surrender.

After the end of World War II the Australian government established the Federal [[Department of Immigration]]. The early policies of [[post-war immigration to Australia]] favoured British and Baltic nationals. In 1946, Corrigan and his mother sailed to Australia on the [[SS Tamaroa|SS ''Tamaroa'']]&lt;ref&gt;Ship's history available at ''New Zealand Maritime Index'', [http://www.nzmaritimeindex.org.nz/izsearchvessels.php?hit=1&amp;name=TAMAROA] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; along with other liberated military POWs, and the family was finally reunited.

As [[displaced person]]s the family resided in a migrant hostel&lt;ref&gt;''National Archives of Australia'', "Migrant hostels in New South Wales, 1946–78" [http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs170.aspx] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Mary's, Sydney]] until their immigration paperwork was finalised. Having lost his place at Sydney's Cranbrook High School due to the war, Corrigan and his family moved initially to Springwood where he attended the [[Blue Mountains Grammar School]]. He completed his Intermediate Certificate examination&lt;ref&gt;''NSW Government: Education and Communities'', "Government Schools of NSW from 1848", [http://www.governmentschools.det.nsw.edu.au/examinations.shtm] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 at the age of 15, after which he left school to take up employment at a [[Unilever]] subsidiary.

On 19 September 1950 Corrigan joined the [[Royal Australian Naval reserve]] and served three years.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Naval Reserve Certificate of Service, Official Number S/10895 (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted Australian citizenship in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Australia Certificate of Registration as an Australian Citizen, dated 26 August 1960, Certificate No. C (1) 4702 (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Corrigan is married to Barbara Lawrence and has four children: David, Kylie, Joel (deceased 1996), Ryan, and two grandchildren.

== Business career ==
Corrigan left school in 1948 at the age of fifteen to work for a [[Unilever]] subsidiary where he was employed as a junior clerk in a freight subdivision. In a 2012 interview Corrigan reflected that he's "been stuck with it ever since".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Andrew, "At Home with Patrick Corrigan", ''The Sun-Herald'', 24 June 2012, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; His career in freight forwarding has often led to confusion with stevedore magnate Chris Corrigan, the former CEO of [[Patrick Corporation]]. They are unrelated, and when quizzed on this point Corrigan is always keen to point out that he is the "poorer one".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Andrew, "At Home with Patrick Corrigan", ''The Sun-Herald'', 24 June 2012, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Corrigan became general manager of the Sydney customs brokering firm J N Campbell Customs Pty Ltd. He remained with the company until 1967, when he established his own freight forwarding and clearance company, Corrigan's Customs Agency Pty Ltd for a $2 registration fee and a $1,000 bank loan.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Business" paragraph 1, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, Corrigan's freight forwarding and clearance companies specialised in shipping fashion, textiles and auxiliary machinery for clients such as Kolotex Pty Ltd, Hilton Pty Ltd and Mark Foys Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;''Fashion News Reel'', December 1969 – January 1970&lt;/ref&gt; as well as yachts, which reflected his personal interest in water sports. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Corrigan's companies also brokered the import/export of works of art for commercial exhibitions, as well as book and records for clients such as Hamlyn Pty Ltd, which coincided with the development of his collecting interests in these areas.

Corrigan's Customs Agency Pty Ltd changed its name to Corrigan's Express Pty Ltd in 1970, expanding its operations and profile with the opening of a large $90,000 freight clearance centre near Sydney airport&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 24 August 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and accreditation by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), membership of which was highly vetted and usually restricted to airlines.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mirror'', 10 December 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it was reported in the press that Corrigan's successfully imported the largest ever painting to Australia – ''American Dream'', an 80 x 18&amp;nbsp;ft work by Brett Whiteley weighing 2.5 tons – for exhibition at Bonython Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 25 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 he also co-founded the firm Express Livestock Pty Ltd, which specialised exclusively in animal cargo.&lt;ref&gt;"Staying Afloat in the Noah's Ark Business", ''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 27 May 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan's Express was sold to the British conglomerate Mitchell Cotts &amp; Co Ltd in 1972 and Corrigan remained as chairman until 1983, when he was recruited to establish the local arm of Swiss company, [[Panalpina]], which specialised in forwarding and logistics services. In 1987 Panalpina became the number one IATA accredited agent in NSW.&lt;ref&gt;"The Winning Edge for Global Business Awards', ''National Business Bulletin'', October 2000, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Corrigan founded a new company, Pace Express, and became its executive chairman. In its first year the company achieved the top ranking for export freight forwarding by the IATA,&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, Mary, "Keeping Pace", ''Cargo Clan'', Vol 15, No 2, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; which stemmed from its logistics initiatives in the fresh fruit market. In 1989 the company won the Governor of Victoria Export Awards&lt;ref&gt;''Export Victoria'', "Governor of Victoria Export Awards", {{cite web |url=http://export.business.vic.gov.au/funding-and-assistance/governor-of-victoria-export-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111053708/http://export.business.vic.gov.au/funding-and-assistance/governor-of-victoria-export-awards |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for significant achievement by a new exporter, and was also named the Exporter of the Year for Transport and Associated Services in the Export Council of Australia's Premier's NSW Export Awards.&lt;ref&gt;''NSW Government: Trade and Investment'', "Premier's NSW Export Awards 2012", [http://www.business.nsw.gov.au/networking-and-events/awards/export-awards] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time any company had won both major awards in one year and the first time a freight forwarder had won either.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, Mary, "Keeping Pace", ''Cargo Clan'', Vol 15, No 2, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Pace Express was acknowledged by the IATA as being the first Australian agent to receive a settlement of more than $2 million for freight forwarding billing in a single month.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 18 February 1993, signed by IATA Director of Agency Services (Area 3), John Louis Malkowski, et al. (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Pace Express was acquired by the American company Air Express International and Corrigan was appointed as director.

== Collecting activities ==

=== Books ===
Australian art and books were the focus of Corrigan's early collecting interests, born from his shipping company's activities freighting for Bonython Galleries and Paul Hamlyn Books. Corrigan developed friendships with artists he met in the [[Art &amp; Australia]] offices of Hamlyn publisher Kevin Weldon. He began to seriously acquire works of art in the early 1970s and by late that decade Corrigan's collecting was supported by a scholarly Australian art book collection, which began with the purchase of his first book in 1974.

Corrigan's art book collection was sold to [[James Hardie|James Hardie Industries]] in 1979, and he remained a consultant to the collection for the next nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Stitz, Charles (ed.), ''Australian Book Collectors'', Bread Street Press, Bendigo, 2010, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It became the core of a donation to the State Library of Queensland in 1988, which is now known as the James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts&lt;ref&gt;''State Library of Queensland'', "James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts",[http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/art-design/hardie] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and which has been described as "Australia's definitive fine arts collection".&lt;ref&gt;Giese, Diana, "The James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts", ''National Library of Australian News'', September 1993, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This collection includes several important 'firsts' in Australian art publishing:
* ''Australian Art'', March 1888 – first Australian art magazine
* ''A Consideration of the Art of Ernest Moffitt'' by Lionel Lindsay, 1899 – first Australian art book published
* ''Night Fall in the Ti-tree'' by Violet Teague, 1905 – first Australian art book with relief prints
* ''The Art of Frederick McCubbin'' by James MacDonald, 1916 – first Australian art book with colour plates
* ''The Art of John Kauffmann'', 1919 – first Australian art book on photography
* ''Margaret Preston, Recent paintings'', 1929 – first portfolio of Australian prints issued in a limited, signed edition. This was also the artist's own copy, with extra material

=== Lindsay Collection ===
Corrigan continues to support the State Library of Queensland with donations to the Library of Australian Fine Art, along with major donations of other material. His most notable donation was the collection of letters and manuscripts by the artist Norman Lindsay and his family, which was valued in the late 1990s at well over $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Robyn, “Norman Lindsay Unplugged”, ''Aussie Post'', December 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Lindsay Collection of Pat Corrigan, donated 1992–1997, is one of the largest donations ever made by an individual to an Australian library.&lt;ref&gt;''State Library of Queensland'', "Lindsay Collection of Pat Corrigan", [http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/art-design/lindsay] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes published and unpublished material relating to the Lindsay family and, importantly, significant material purchased from Harry Chaplin's collection,&lt;ref&gt;Stitz, Charles (ed.), ''Australian Book Collectors'', Bread Street Press, Bendigo, 2010, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; a friend and bibliographer of the family.

=== Manuscripts ===
Alongside the Lindsay Collection donation, Corrigan also collected manuscripts and other material and original works of art by other artists, which were subsequently also donated to the State Library of Queensland. These include:
* Pixie O'Harris – books, correspondence, original artworks, photographs, bookplates and ephemera
* Sidney Nolan – correspondence, photographs and news clippings
* Correspondence from Australian artists including George Lambert, J.J. Hilder, Julian Ashton, Margaret Preston
* Correspondence to bookplate collector John Gartner
* Collection of material by Christian Waller including bookplates, sketch book, ''The gates of Dawn'' with original linocut and ten proof pages
* Two cartoons for stained glass windows by Christian Waller
* Twenty photographs of Australian artists by Greg Weight
* The collection of forty-five private press books published by the Queensberry Hill Press
* Three Giuseppe Romeo artist's books

In addition, Corrigan has donated personal correspondence with artists he has supported over the years, including many of those assisted over twelve years as patron of the National Association for the Visual Arts Visual and Craft Artists' Grant Scheme. [see section on philanthropy]

===Australian exhibition catalogues===
Corrigan has also donated a major collection of Australian art exhibition catalogues, invitations and journals to the Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art. Known as ''The Patrick Corrigan Collection of Australian Exhibition Catalogues'', the collection comprises over 800 items dated 1889–2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art'', "The Patrick Corrigan Collection of Australian Exhibition Catalogues" {{cite web |url=http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/research/library/collections/special_collections/the_patrick_corrigan_collection_of_australian_exhibition_catalogues |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140328005937/http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/research/library/collections/special_collections/the_patrick_corrigan_collection_of_australian_exhibition_catalogues |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include:
* ''A Farewell Exhibition of Old and New Works by John Passmore'', Terry Clune Galleries, Sydney, 1960
* ''Roland Wakelin &amp; Thea Proctor'', Festival Exhibition, Armidale, 1964
* ''Exhibition of Pictures by Mrs E. Phillips Fox'', Anthony Hordern's Fine Art Gallery, Sydney, 1913
* ''Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings of New Guinea by Captain Ivor Hele'', Official War Artist, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, 1945
* ''Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by George W. Lambert'', The Fine Art Society's Gallery, Melbourne, 1921

=== Bookplates ===
An interest in art and books also led to Corrigan collecting artist [[bookplate]]s, which he acquired over a twenty-year period between 1975 and 1995, following the acquisition of the collection of John Lane Mullins (1857–1939), an avid enthusiast and supporter who had commissioned the first Australian pictorial bookplate.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Dictionary of Biography'',"John Lane Mullins", [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mullins-john-lane-7680] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s he acquired the bookplate collection of the late Harry Muir, founder of Adelaide's [[Wakefield Press (Australia)|Wakefield Press]].

Described as "the most comprehensive collection of bookplates by Australian artists ever amassed",&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Michael, "Hunting and Gathering … and Giving", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery Society of NSW, 2011, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pat Corrigan Collection of Australian Artists' Bookplates'', comprising five thousand plates and related objects, including original artwork, transitional states of the plate and original blocks, was donated to the Art Gallery of New South Wales&lt;ref&gt;''Art Gallery of New South Wales'', "Archives at the Art Gallery of NSW", [http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/research/archives/] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995, valued at $750,000.

Corrigan has also made significant bookplate donations to the National Gallery of Australia (1983), Powerhouse Museum, Sydney (2009), the State Libraries of Queensland and Victoria (which included original works of art and publications on bookplates), the Fryer Library University of Queensland (2002) and regional art galleries at Benalla (2004), Bendigo (2001), Castlemaine (1999), the Gold Coast and Lismore (2006), Maitland and MacKay (2005), Orange and Toowoomba, and New England (2001).

Corrigan also supported artists through bookplate commissions for his family. In this context, he introduced the concept of Ex Libris to many artists who would not otherwise have been represented in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "The Bookplate Artists", paragraph 2, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan's family commissions included bookplates by: Earle Backen (1927–2005), William Rubery Bennett (1893–1987), Peter Shearwin Chapman (born 1937), John Coburn (1925–2006), L. Roy Davies (1897–1979), Brian Dunlop (1938–2009), Joel Elenberg (1948–1980), Allan Allman Gamble (1907–2001), Bruce Goold (born 1948), Peter Vernon Hickey (born 1943), Robert Jacks (born 1943), Peter Kingston (born 1943), Alun Leach-Jones (born 1937), David van Nunen (born 1952), Pixie O’Harris (1903–1991), David Lloyd Preston (born 1948), Lloyd Frederic Rees (1895–1988), Irena Justina Sibley (1944–2009), Blake Lawry Twigden (born 1945), Brett Whiteley (1939–1992) and James Willem Willbrant (born 1950).

In his book on Corrigan's collections and commissions of bookplates, Robert Littlewood describes Corrigan's focus on Ex Libris bookplates as having “significant impact in the marketplace … on the aesthetic direction of contemporary bookplates; and … influenced curatorial consciousness and activity in relation to this aspect of the Book Arts”.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Philanthropy", paragraph 2, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, in particular, is borne out in a recent article published by the magazine of the National Library of Australia, which featured several of the Corrigan family's bookplates.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Reeder, Stephanie, “The intimate and idiosyncratic bookplate”, ''The National Library Magazine'', 22 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 exhibition of the New Australian Bookplate society, Corrigan was credited amongst a small and select group as rekindling Australia's interest in the art.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Mark Ferson, President, New Australian Bookplate Society, ''SHARP: [[Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing]]'', "Bookplated Old and New", [http://www.sharpweb.org/event/exhibition-new-australian-bookplate-society/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian art and photography ===
Corrigan has collected Australian art from around 1970 when his company, Corrigan's Express, started freighting works of art and books. Through connections made at the offices of Hamlyn Books' publication Art in Australia, he met artists such as John Coburn, Brett Whiteley, Pro Hart and Neil Taylor, and collectors such as Neil Balnaves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Balnaves Foundation'', [http://www.balnavesfoundation.com/biography] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His first purchase was a Paddington street (Sydney) scene by Ric Elliot.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Alison, "Pat Corrigan, Sophisticated Beggar", ''Art Market Report'', No.12 Winter 2004,pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; Of his approach to collecting, Corrigan has stated that he has bought works by artists and then sold them to friends for the same price, just to spread the word.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Jill, "Art of Sharing", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery Society of NSW, July 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan also constantly deaccessions from his collection through donations to public institutions. Since 1986 he has donated over one thousand works to more than forty-five Cultural Gift Recipients nationwide.

Artists whose works Corrigan has collected include [[Christian Thompson (artist)|Christian Thompson]], Grace Cossington Smith, Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd, Alun Leach-Jones, Colin Lanceley, Brett Whiteley, Lloyd Rees, John Olsen, Rosalie Gascoigne, John Beard, Ben Quilty, Noel McKenna, Susan Norrie, Ken Whisson, Robert Klippel, John Coburn, Janet Laurence, Clement Meadmore, Tim Storrier, Gordon Bennett and Michael Zavros.

Corrigan's photography collection includes works by Tracey Moffatt, Bill Henson, Christian Thompson, Max Dupain, Olive Cotton, Mervyn Bishop, Harold Cazneaux, Mark Kimber, Robert McFarlane, Selina Ou, Roger Scott, Caleb Carter, Geoff Carter, Greg Weight, Jon Lewis, Graham McCarter, Lewis Morley, David Moore, Robyn Stacey, Anne Zahalka, Patricia Piccinini, Simryn Gill, Deborah Paauwe and [[Polixeni Papapetrou]].

Corrigan's enthusiasm for collecting art is paralleled with his enthusiasm for sharing it with the broader public. His total collection is estimated to be around two thousand works and at the time of publication of his third book on his Indigenous art collection (2015) he had over six hundred and fifty works on long-term loan to multiple public institutions and universities in states where he has residences. These institutions include [[Bond University]], the University of Technology, University of NSW Art &amp; Design,&lt;ref&gt;"Supporter Patrick Corrigan AM, ''UNSW Art &amp; Design'' [https://www.artdesign.unsw.edu.au/whats-on/news/patrick-corrigan-am] Retrieved 31 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and SBS Television in Sydney (NSW), as well as Monash University and [[Asialink]] in Melbourne (VIC) and the Australian National University (ACT).

Corrigan's donations to Bond University's Medical School are now being publicly showcased in The Corrigan Walk,&lt;ref&gt;''Bond University'', "The Corrigan Walk" [https://bond.edu.au/alumni-partners/community/indigenous-initiatives/corrigan-walk-art-tour] Retrieved 11 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; an on-campus guided tour of a selection of the donations and 400-strong works in the loan collection, led by indigenous students.&lt;ref&gt;Shaya Laughlin, Shaya, "Go walkabout to gaze at art", ''Gold Coast Bulletin'', 3 August 2013, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

At any given time, Corrigan also has works pending and/or already on loan to public exhibitions around the country.

== Art and book publishing ==
Corrigan's love of art and books led him to venture into publishing, in tandem with his freight business interests. He supported Richard Griffin (1937–1991), the Sydney bookseller, publisher and owner of Gryphon Press, with financial guarantees for the publication of his Private Press' limited edition art books on the work of Brett Whiteley: ''Zoo'' (1979), ''Another Way of Looking at Vincent Van Gogh'' (1983) and ''Native Rose'' (1986), which was based upon [[Ernest Giles]]'s story of his explorations in Central Australia. Each book contained an original print by the artist. His company, Southern Cross Books, also published ''Carmen'' by Prosper Mérimée, with illustrations by Lionel Lindsay (1984). He also supported Port Jackson Press for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Business", paragraph 3, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan continues to support independent publications through sponsorship, the most recent being ''Brushes with History: Masters of Watercolour'', produced by the Australian Watercolour Institute in March 2015 to celebrate its ninetieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Watercolour Institute'', [http://www.awi.com.au/home/index.aspx], Retrieved 25 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan's printmaking ventures date to the same period. He shared an office/studio/gallery with Storrier for three years in Sydney's Rushcutters Bay, during which time he met many leading Australian artists. Over the course of this period Corrigan published Tim Storrier's limited edition 'Time Site Suite' (1981), which was a portfolio of seven lithographs, colour photographs and mixed media works in a limited edition of sixty. Corrigan also published a suite of hand coloured etchings titled 'Birds from a Woollahra Garden' by Blake Twigden (1982), and produced four silkscreen prints and the soft ground etching, 'Bay at Northwood' (1984) by Lloyd Rees.

In a period in the late 1980s Corrigan was also part owner of Craftsman House and was instrumental in the publication of books on the work of several artists: ''Colin Lanceley'' (1987), ''Lloyd Rees, An Artist Remembers'' (1987), ''Point to Point, the Art of Tim Storrier'' (1987), ''John Coburn, Paintings'' (1988), and ''Alun Leach-Jones'' (1988).

== Philanthropy ==
In addition to major donations of art, books and material heritage collections to public institutions [see Collecting Activities section], Corrigan has donated more than one thousand works of art to over forty-five regional galleries, cultural institutions and charitable organisations across the country.

Corrigan initiated the ''Mitchell Cotts Art Awards'', City Art Institute (now [[UNSW Art &amp; Design|College of Fine Arts]], Sydney) in 1982, which bestowed two annual awards to the value of $10–15,000 enabling young artists to continue their studies and to travel to broaden their experience.

In 1997 Corrigan inaugurated the ''Pat Corrigan Travelling Art Scholarship'' for painting students at Sydney's [[National Art School]].

'''Memorabilia'''

Corrigan's interest in sailing stimulated his interest in America's Cup [[Souvenir|memorabilia]]. Corrigan's lifelong interest in memorabilia is very broad, leading to more than 500 collections of diverse material. Most notable among these is his collection of signed photographs by famous stars, including Lauren Bacall, Sophia Loren, Mickey Rooney and Tony Curtis. This collection was donated to the Maitland Regional Art Gallery and was the subject of the exhibition ''Signed and Famous'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;''Maitland Regional Art Gallery'', "Past Exhibitions", ''Signed and Famous'', 27 January–26 February 2012, [http://mrag.org.au/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazz'''

Corrigan's love of jazz dates to 1945, after arriving in Sydney following his release from the internment camp when he heard the radio for the first time in years. He credits getting hooked on jazz through the likes of Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman and Frank Sinatra.&lt;ref&gt;ARCH, Magazine of Bond University, QLD, Winter 2012, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; "There was a blackout on news, so when I came here I had not heard music for years ... the next thing I knew, I had a collection of [[Gramophone record|78s]]. I ended up with 7,000 of them".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Katrina, "Mastering the Art of Collecting", ''The Financial Review'', 12 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, which was augmented by magazines such as ''[[Down Beat]]'' and ''[[Metronome Magazine|Metronome]]'', along with jazz biographies (many signed by luminaries such as Duke Ellington), was donated to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, known as the National Film and Sound Archive Unit of the National Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan stated that jazz "galvanised my love of the arts"&lt;ref&gt;''ARCH'', Magazine of Bond University, QLD, Winter 2012, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and this mix of interests found expression in philanthropic support for a series of concerts under the banner, "Jazz at the Gallery", held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales over the past five years, and the "Flights of Jazz" series of three concerts in 2002. In September and October 2013 he teamed up with Deloitte to support two concerts for the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales' "Resonate" series.&lt;ref&gt;"All that Jazz", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery society of NSW, August 2013, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman's investment banking practice primarily encompasses advising Boards of Directors, private equity firms, and buyers and sellers of distressed, stressed or "story" situations. Because it does not represent creditors, Gordian is able to achieve meaningful equity recoveries in insolvent situations. In 2013, he testified in front of the ABI Commission on Bankruptcy Reform in regards to valuation. At Bacchus Capital, he is actively involved in the fund's selection and oversight of portfolio company wineries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/boutique-vintners-turn-to-private-equity-for-help/ Boutique Vintners Turn to Private Equity for Help.

'''''Siemens''''' is the name of a family of German technology and telecommunications [[industrialist]]s, founders and to the present day largest shareholders of [[Siemens]] AG. The family have a wealth of over €8billion, making them the 5th richest family in Germany, according to Handelsblatt [https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/mittelstand/familienunternehmer/siemens-porsche-merck-das-sind-deutschlands-reichste-unternehmer-clans/20245870.html]

== History ==
[[File:Goslar - Siemenshaus aus 1693.JPG|thumb|Siemens House at [[Goslar]], built in 1692]]

=== Origin ===
The Siemens family was first documented in 1384 with '''Henning Symons''', a farmer of the [[Free imperial city]] of [[Goslar]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The family tree begins with ''Ananias Siemens'' (ca 1538-1591), a citizen, brewer and owner of an [[oil mill]] at Goslar, belonging to the Shoemaker's [[Guild]], as his ancestors have been shoemakers.

His grandson Hans (1628–94), speaker of the Merchant's Guild and commander of the town's vigilance committee, built the Siemens House at Goslar in 1692. It is still owned by the family and houses their private archives and an exhibition on the family history. The Siemens family provided numerous members to the Goslar city council as well as four mayors, the last being Johann Georg (1748–1807).

===Development===
[[File:Berlin Siemensstadt Kabelwerk Westend.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens]]-Cable Factory in Berlin-[[Siemensstadt]] around 1900]]
The most important branches of the Goslar family (there are also other families with the same surname in Northern Germany) go back to the farmer Christian Ferdinand Siemens (1787–1840). His sons [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Werner Siemens]] (since 1888 ''von'' Siemens), [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|(Carl) Wilhelm Siemens]] (known as ''Sir William Siemens''), Hans Siemens, Friedrich Siemens and [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl (Heinrich) von Siemens]] became engineers and entrepreneurs.

Werner Siemens, a former artillery and engineering officer in the Prussian army, invented a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] that used a needle to point to the right letter, instead of using [[Morse code]]. Based on this invention, he founded the company ''[[Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske]]'' on 1 October 1847, with the company taking occupation of its workshop on 12 October. His business partner [[Johann Georg Halske]], a master mechanic, was particularly involved in the construction and design of electrical equipment such as the press which enabled wires to be insulated with a seamless coat of [[gutta-percha]], the pointer telegraph, the [[Samuel Morse|morse]] telegraph and measuring instruments. The company was internationalised soon after its founding. One brother of Werner represented him in England ([[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Sir William Siemens]]) and another in [[St.Petersburg]], [[Russia]] ([[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl von Siemens]]), each earning recognition. In 1867 Mr Halske withdrew from the company because his more conservative views on company policy diverged from those of the rather venturous Siemens brothers.

In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500&amp;nbsp;km from Berlin to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European ([[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to [[London]]) telegraph line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html | title=Siemens history | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1870 a [[transatlantic communications cable]]. In 1857, Werner von Siemens described the [[countercurrent exchange]] and in 1867 a [[dynamo]] without permanent magnets. A similar system was also independently invented by [[Charles Wheatstone]], but Siemens became the first company to build such devices. In 1881, a Siemens [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Alternator]] driven by a [[watermill]] was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of [[Godalming]], United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into [[electric locomotive|electric trains]] and [[light bulbs]]. In 1887 it opened its first office in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens website [http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm August 1, 2012 – 125 Years Siemens in Japan (1887–2012)] Retrieved on August 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm.

In 1888, Werner Siemens received hereditary [[German nobility|ennoblement]] as ''von'' Siemens by [[Frederick III, German Emperor]]. His brother [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|William]] had been [[knight]]ed – becoming Sir William – by [[Queen Victoria]] a few months before his death in 1883. The brother [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl]] in St. Petersburg was ennobled by [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1895. Werner's cousin and father-in-law, Carl Georg Siemens (1809–1885), a professor of technology at the [[University of Hohenheim]], received personal ennoblement by the [[Kingdom of Württemberg|King of Württemberg]]. Werner's nephew [[Georg von Siemens|Georg]], co-founder of [[Deutsche Bank]], was ennobled by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], in 1899.

Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become [[Siemens-Schuckert]]. In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the [[Osram]] [[lightbulb]] company. During the 1920s and 1930s, S &amp; H started to manufacture [[radios]], [[television set]]s, and [[electron microscopes]]. In 1932, [[:de:Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall|Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall]] (Erlangen), [[Phönix AG]] (Rudolstadt) and [[Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH]] (Berlin) merged to form the [[Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG]] (SRW), a producer of medical technology and the third of the so-called ''parent companies'' that [[Ernst von Siemens]] decided in 1966 to merge to form the present-day [[Siemens]] AG,&lt;ref name="historysite"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the largest electro-technological firms in the world. The company, during all its stages from Siemens &amp; Halske AG, Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG until its merger to [[Siemens AG]] in 1966, has always been led by subsequent generations of the founder's family, at first by Werner's brother [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl]], then by Werner's sons [[Arnold von Siemens|Arnold]], [[Georg Wilhelm von Siemens|Wilhelm]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens|Carl Friedrich]], later by his grandsons [[Hermann von Siemens|Hermann]] and [[Ernst von Siemens|Ernst]], and until 1981 by his great-grandson [[Peter von Siemens]].

Today the descendants of Werner and Carl von Siemens have a minority ownership of 6.9% (by comparison: the [[Ford family tree|Ford family]] controls the Ford Motor Company with a share of 2%), thus still being the largest single shareholder. Based on a market cap of €112billion, the Siemens family holds €7,7 billion worth of common stock in the company and received €201million in dividends in 2016. Considerable parts of this share have been endowed to [[charitable trust]]s controlled by family members. The family keeps a seat in the Siemens [[Supervisory Board]] and is said to take influence in the background. Until 1981, the chairman of the Supervisory Board has always been a member of the family. The ''von Siemens'' are said to return to the chairmanship in the future should necessity require it or an eligible candidate be ready to run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.handelsblatt.com/edition/102/ressort/companies-markets/article/siemens-appoints-heir-of-founder-to-board Siemens Names Founder's Heir to Board], Global Edition Handelsblatt, January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleofvalues.com/vltg_portfolio/we-say-it-we-mean-it/ ''How can we live our values embracing our heritage?''], an interview with Dr. Nathalie von Siemens&lt;/ref&gt; The clan's principal aim has always been to guarantee its 169 years old company independence, stability and solid growth.

'''Slavoljub Eduard Penkala''' ({{IPA-sh|slâʋɔʎuːb ɛ̂duard pɛŋkǎːla|hr}}) (20 April 1871 - 5 February 1922) was a [[Croatia]]n engineer and [[inventor]] of [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-[[Poles|Polish]]-[[Jews|Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=|first=|title=Google obilježio 141. godišnjicu rođenja Slavoljuba Penkale|pages= |publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]] |date=2012-04-20|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/tech/google-obiljezio-141-godisnjicu-rodzenja-slavoljuba-penkale.html|accessdate=2012-04-20|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[HINA]] |title=Google se sjetio Penkale |pages= |publisher=[[Business.hr]] |date=2012-04-20 |url=http://www.business.hr/business-class/google-se-sjetio-penkale |accessdate=2012-04-20 |language=hr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420134705/http://www.business.hr/business-class/google-se-sjetio-penkale |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penkala-Moster tvornica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"Penkala-Moster" pen and pencil company in Zagreb]]
Eduard Penkala was born in [[Liptovský Mikuláš|Liptószentmiklós]] (now Liptovský Mikuláš), then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to Franciszek Pękała, who was of Polish heritage, and Maria Pękała (née Hannel), who was of Dutch descent. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and [[TU Dresden|Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute]], graduating from the latter on March 25, 1898, and going on to earn a [[doctorate]] in [[organic chemistry]]. During his studies, he attended violin lessons where he met his future wife, pianist Emily Stoffregen. He then moved with his wife to [[Zagreb]] (which was then in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]). To mark his loyalty to his new homeland, he took on the Croatian name Slavoljub (the equivalent of slavophile), becoming a naturalized [[Croats|Croat]].

He became renowned for further development of the [[mechanical pencil]] (1906)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penkala.com.hr/en/penkala_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006053423/http://www.penkala.com.hr/en/penkala_en.htm |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - then called an "automatic pencil" - and the first solid-ink [[fountain pen]] (1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croatia.hr/English/Penkala/Inovacije.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406220807/http://www.croatia.hr/English/Penkala/Inovacije.aspx |archivedate=2007-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of [[Edmund Moster]], he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time. The company, now called [[TOZ Penkala]], still exists today.

He also constructed the first Croatian aircraft to fly in the country, the [[Penkala 1910 Biplane]], flown by [[Dragutin Novak]], who was also the first Croatian pilot. He constructed and invented many other products and devices, and held a total of 80 [[patent]]s.

Among his patented inventions were:

* a [[hot water bottle]] - his first patented invention, the "Termofor"
* a type of bluing [[detergent]]
* a rail-car [[brake]]
* an [[battery (vacuum tube)#B battery|anode battery]]

He also founded another company called the Elevator Chemical Manufacturing Company, which produced various chemicals such as detergents, sealing wax, and "Radium Vinovica", a [[Patent medicine|patent-medicine]] – like product that was billed as curing [[rheumatism]].

He had four children with his wife, Emily.

Penkala died in Zagreb at the age of 50, after catching [[pneumonia]] on a business trip. He was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, Mirogoj RKT-78-I-117&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''William C. Goggin''' (August 26, 1911 – December 14, 1988) was an American chemist, business manager and business theorist, noted for developing the concept of [[Multidimensional organization]] at [[Dow Corning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Galbraith, Jay R.]], and Daniel A. Nathanson. ''Strategy implementation: The role of structure and process.'' St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Company, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Lincoln Ackoff]].

''American anti-management theories of organization: A critique of paradigm proliferation.'' Vol. 25. Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Alma, Michigan]], Goggin obtained his BS in chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at [[Alma College]] in 1933, and at the [[University of Michigan]] his BS in Electrical Engineering in 1935 and his MS in Electrical Engineering in 1936.&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= William C. Goggin |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/goggin-william-c|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite book|first=James J. |last=Bohning |title=William C. Goggin, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by James J. Bohning at Midland, Michigan on 20 August 1986 |date=20 August 1986 |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/sites/default/files/goggin_wc_0047_suppl.pdf|place=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=[[Science History Institute|Chemical Heritage Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goggin spend his most of his career at [[Dow Chemical Company]], where he started after graduation in 1936 in the Student Training Program. He got further acquainted with the company as Engineer in the Physics Research Laboratory from 1937 to 1939, and as Salesman in the Special Products Division from 1939 to 1941. In 1941 he started in management as Assistant Manager in the Plastics Sales Division, where he became manager in 1942 and manager in the Plastics Development Division in 1943. In 1947 he moved to the Plastics Technical Service, and in 1959 became General Manager of the Plastics Department. In 1967 he moved to the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], where he was President and Director until 1971, and then became its Chairman of the Board until 1976.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

In 1954 Goggin was awarded an Honorary D.Sc. from Alma College, and in 1976 he was listed unto the Plastics Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

== Work ==

=== Multidimensional organization ===
As CEO of [[Dow Corning]] from 1967 to 1971 Goggin developed a type of organization structure, which became known as the [[Multidimensional organization]]. In the 1974 article "How the multidimensional structure works at Dow Corning"  in the ''Harvard Business Review,'' Goggin described the occasion and motivation of his innovation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although [[Dow Corning]] was a healthy corporation in 1967, it showed symptoms of difficulty that troubled many of us in top management. These symptoms were, and still are, common ones in U.S. business and have been described countless times in reports, audits, articles, and speeches. Our symptoms took such form as: 
# Executives did not have adequate financial information and control of their operations. Marketing managers, for example, did not know how much it cost to produce a product. Prices and margins were set by the division managers. 
# Cumbersome communications channels existed between key functions, especially manufacturing and marketing. 
# In the face of stiffening competition, the corporation remained too internalized in its thinking and organizational structure. It was insufficiently oriented to the outside world. 
# Lack of communication between divisions not only created the antithesis of a corporate team effort but also was wasteful of a precious resource-people.
# Long-range corporate planning was sporadic and superficial; this was leading to overstaffing, duplicated effort, and inefficiency. 
Fearing that our problems would become worse instead of better in the future, we undertook major changes in our organizational structure. We turned to a matrix concept of organization-what we later came to call the ''[[multidimensional organization]].''&lt;ref&gt;Goggin (1974, 54)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Goggin had joined Dow Corning, the organization was structured as [[matrix organization]]. As main building blocks were seen the [[profit center]] and [[cost centre (business)|cost center]]. Goggin explained, that in the concept of the multidimensional organization, two extra dimensions were added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we first thought of it, the matrix organization was to be two-dimensional... the different businesses in Dow Corning were seen as:
# '''''Profit centers.''''' These were the different businesses the company was in. Businesses were defined along product lines-for instance, rubber, encapsulants and sealants; resins and chemicals; fluids, emulsions, and compounds; specialty lubricants; and consumer, medical, and semi-conductor products. In most of the cases each business's product line served a related group of industries, markets, or customers. 
# '''''Cost centers.''''' These were functional activities and included marketing, manufacturing, technical service and development, and research, as well as a number of supportive activities, such as corporate communications, legal and administrative services, economic evaluation, the controller's office, the treasurer's office, and industrial relations.&lt;br&gt;But soon we came to see further dimensions of the system:
# '''''Geographical areas.''''' Business development varied widely horn area to area, and the profit-center and cost-center dimensions could not be carried out everywhere in the same manner... 
# '''''Space and time.''''' A fourth dimension of the organization denotes fluidity and movement through time (see Part D). The multidimensional organization is far from rigid; it is constantly changing. Unlike centralized or decentralized systems that too often are rooted deep in the past, the multidimensional organization is geared toward the future. Long-term planning is an inherent part of its operation.&lt;ref name="G 74 55"&gt;Goggin (1974, 55)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About Geographical areas Goggin further explained "that each area is considered to be both a profit and a cost center. Dow Coming area organizations are patterned after our major U.S. organization. Although somewhat autonomous in their operation, they subscribe to the overall corporate objectives, operating guidelines, and planning criteria. During the annual planning cycle, for example, there is a mutual exchange of sales, expense, and profit projections between the functional and business managers headquartered in the United States and the area managers around the world."&lt;ref name="G 74 55"/&gt;

'''World of Commodore''' is an annual [[computer expo]] dedicated to [[Commodore International|Commodore]] computers.

The shows were initially organized by [[Commodore Canada]] or its sister companies, and took place at the [[International Centre]] in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], though in some years additional expos were held in the United States, Australia, or Europe.  The expos were among the largest in the computing industry, with attendance at some events reaching 100,000.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;  As with cross-industry trade shows such as [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] and [[COMDEX]], World of Commodore expos were widely reported on in computing magazines.

With the decline of its 8-bit product line and the rise of the [[Amiga]], Commodore began branding some of the expos as '''World of Commodore/Amiga'''.  The name was changed to '''World of Amiga''' following Commodore's bankruptcy in 1994 and purchase by German PC conglomerate [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]] the following year.  The Amiga expos continued until 2002.  In 2004, the original exhibition series was revived by the [[Toronto PET Users Group]].&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;  {{As of|2016}} World of Commodore continues under TPUG's aegis, albeit on a scale much reduced since the expo's heyday.&lt;ref name="woc2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daffern" /&gt;

==Show highlights==

===1983===

World of Commodore 1987 was held at the International Centre in Mississauga.  There were over 85 exhibitors, including TPUG, ''Ahoy!'', Electronic Arts, ''The Transactor'', [[NewTek]], [[Supra, Inc.]], Gold Disk, Xetec, and Commodore itself.&lt;ref name="randall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;  The show's major focus was on the [[Amiga 1000]], [[Amiga 500]], and [[Amiga 2000]], with comparatively few offerings for Commodore's 8-bit and PC-compatible lines.&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;

Commodore demoed the A2300 Genlock and the PVA, two new genlock cards for the Amiga 2000, and announced two new PC-compatible systems: the [[Commodore PC compatible systems|PC 10-III]], a 9.54&amp;nbsp;MHz [[IBM XT|XT]] clone, and the [[Commodore PC compatible systems|PC-60]], a [[Intel 80386|386]]-based machine running [[XENIX]].&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;  New productivity software exhibited at the show included [[Berkeley Softworks]]'s [[geoPublish]], Electronic Arts's [[PaperClip|PaperClip III]] and [[Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing]], and NewTek's [[Video Toaster]].&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;  New games for the [[Commodore 64]] and 128 came mostly from Electronic Arts, and included ''[[Halls of Montezuma: A Battle History of the U.S. Marine Corps|Halls of Montezuma]]'', ''[[Bard's Tale III]]'', ''[[Skyfox II]]'', ''[[Strike Fleet]]'', and ''[[Skate or Die]]''.&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;  New Amiga software demoed or announced included ''[[Arkanoid]]'', ''[[Bard's Tale II]]'', ''[[Reach for the Stars (video game)|Reach for the Stars]]'', ''[[Thexder]]'', ''[[Space Quest II]]'', ''[[Police Quest]]'', ''[[The Hunt for Red October (1987 video game)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', and [[WordPerfect]].&lt;ref name="randall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="randall2" /&gt;

Seminars were presented by Jim Butterfield, Steve Punter, [[Fred Fish]], and others.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;  The expo achieved record attendance of 42,000.&lt;ref name="scuttlebutt" /&gt;

===1988===

1988 marked the first time that two World of Commodore expos were held: one in November at the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]],&lt;ref name="clips" /&gt; and the other in December in [[Toronto]].

Attendance at the Toronto expo was over 43,300, surpassing the record set the previous year.  As in 1987, the Amiga dominated all aspects of the show.&lt;ref name="scuttlebutt" /&gt;  Exhibitors included [[Ion Publishing]], publishers of ''[[Ahoy!]]'' and ''AmigaUser''.&lt;ref name="scuttlebutt" /&gt;

At the US show [[ReadySoft]] demonstrated AMAX, a [[Macintosh]] emulator for the Amiga.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In September, 1988 a World Of Commodore expo was held at the newly opened Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour, Sydney, Australia.

===1989===

Three World of Commodore shows were held in 1989: the original Canadian edition was held from 30 November to 4 December in Toronto, an American East Coast edition was held from 22 to 24 September in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and an American West Coast edition took place at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] from 19 to 21 May.&lt;ref name="clips" /&gt;

The Los Angeles show saw exhibits and announcements from Commodore, NewTek, [[MicroIllusions]], Xetec, ''Amiga World'', and [[Canon Inc.]].&lt;ref name="amiganews" /&gt;

===1990===

Beginning in 1990, the expo was rebranded World of Commodore Amiga.  The show was noted for Commodore's announcement and early demo of the [[Commodore CDTV]].  Third-party exhibitors included [[Walt Disney Computer Software]], ''[[Amazing Computing]]'', ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'', Xetec, Abacus, [[Creative Micro Designs]], Gold Disk, [[Sierra On-Line]], [[Kawai Musical Instruments]], and [[COMPUTE! Publications]].&lt;ref name="woc1990" /&gt;

===1991===

A World of Commodore was held at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] in [[London]] from 14 to 17 November 1991, and a World of Commodore Amiga took place at the [[Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre]] in [[Australia]] from 12 to 14 July 1991.  At these shows Commodore launched its CDTV multimedia platform.&lt;ref name="cdtv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amazing" /&gt;  The London show was supported by companies such as Electronic Arts, [[Psygnosis]], and [[Ocean Software|Ocean]].&lt;ref name="amazing" /&gt;

===1992===

World of Commodore 1992 was held in [[Pasadena, California]] in September 1992; attendance was estimated at nearly 20,000.&lt;ref name="overscan" /&gt; Commodore used the event to introduce the [[Amiga 4000]], the [[Amiga 600]] and [[Amiga 600|Amiga 600HD]], [[AmigaDOS]] 3.0, and the [[Amiga A570|A570]] CD-ROM drive for the [[Amiga 500]].&lt;ref name="overscan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amiga4000" /&gt;  Commodore also presented "Father of the Amiga" [[Jay Miner]] with one of the very first Amiga 4000s.&lt;ref name="overscan" /&gt;  Third-party exhibitors releasing and demonstrating new products included [[SAS Institute]], [[Scala, Inc.]], Gold Disk, and [[Digital Creations (California company)|Digital Creations]].&lt;ref name="overscan" /&gt;

A World of Commodore/Amiga 1992 took place at the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] grounds in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]] from 26 to 29 November 1992.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;  The expo was colocated with the Amiga '92 show; there were around 150 exhibitors and visitor attendance was expected to reach 100,000.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heinisch" /&gt;  Though the expo included a special anniversary celebration for the Commodore 64, only a very small minority of exhibitors and visitors were 8-bit computer users.&lt;ref name="heinisch" /&gt;

===1993===

World of Commodore and World of Commodore/Amiga expos were held in several locations in 1993, including [[New York City]];&lt;ref name="notepad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Sydney, Australia;&lt;ref name="woc1993" /&gt; Pasadena, California;&lt;ref name="pasadena1993" /&gt; [[Cologne]], Germany;&lt;ref name="vost" /&gt; and Mississauga, Ontario.

The New York show was well attended and featured 30 exhibitors, many of which were [[mail order]] companies.&lt;ref name="ny1993" /&gt;  Commodore displayed a prototype of its new [[Amiga 4000]] tower model, and wowed visitors with a demonstration of full-screen 30 [[frame rate|FPS]] [[MPEG-1|MPEG]] video on a stock Amiga 4000/030.&lt;ref name="ny1993" /&gt;

The Australian expo featured exhibits by ''[[Amazing Computing]]'', ''[[Amiga Format]]'', Commodore, and [[Mindscape]].&lt;ref name="woc1993" /&gt;

At the Pasadena show, Commodore US President Jim Dionne outlined his plans for [[Amiga CD32]] sales to bring the company back into profit.  Commodore also announced the impending release of [[AmigaDOS]] 3.1, the aforementioned Amiga 4000 tower model, and CD32-compatible [[CD-ROM]] drives for the Amiga 4000 and [[Amiga 1200]].&lt;ref name="pasadena1993" /&gt;

The World of Commodore in Cologne took place from 5 to 7 November 1993.  It featured over 150 companies and had a Saturday attendance of over 50,000.  Contrary to expectations, Commodore did not launch the Amiga 4000 tower model, but heavily promoted the CD32 with about 60 demonstrator models.  The highlight of the show was COME Corporate Media's [[Photo CD]] system.&lt;ref name="vost" /&gt;

===1995===

Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, and the following year its assets were purchased by the German PC conglomerate [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]].  Escom took over organization of the World of Commodore exhibitions, rebranding them World of Amiga.  Its first World of Amiga expo was held at the International Centre in Mississauga in December 1995.  The show featured Escom's new subsidiary [[Amiga Technologies]], as well as 30 other hardware and software exhibitors.&lt;ref name="wonder" /&gt;  The show was criticized for exhibitors' focus on sales rather than demonstrations and product launches.  Among the few new products released was [[Idruna Software]]'s [[Photogenics]].&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt;

===2004===

In 2004, the defunct World of Commodore expo was revived by the Toronto PET Users Group.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daffern" /&gt;  The event was held at the Belaire Hotel in Toronto on 4 December, and featured talks and demos by Jim Butterfield, Jim Brain, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], former ''Transactor'' editor [[Karl Hildon|Karl J. H. Hildon]], Commodore Canada vice president Ron Anderson, and a representative of Commodore trademark holders [[Tulip Computers]].&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="woc2004" /&gt;

===2006===
World of Commodore 2006 was held at the Alderwood United Church in Toronto on 2 December.  It featured screenings of the [[TVOntario]] series ''[[Bits and Bytes]]'',&lt;ref name="daffern" /&gt; a guest talk by [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] designer Jeri Ellsworth,&lt;ref name="woc2006" /&gt; and the final World of Commodore appearance by author Jim Butterfield.&lt;ref name="bolton" /&gt;  Though attendance was just 75, the expo attracted coverage from news outlets such as ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and ''[[The Toronto Star]]''.&lt;ref name="daffern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="henry" /&gt;

===2007===

Toronto's Alderwood United Church was the venue for TPUG's World of Commodore 2007.  The event, held on 1 December 2007, featured several tributes to Commodore pioneer Jim Butterfield, who had died of cancer earlier that year.&lt;ref name="woc2007" /&gt;

===2012===

World of Commodore 2012 was organized by [[TPUG]] and held at the Admiral Inn in Mississauga, Ontario on 1 December 2012.&lt;ref name="woc2012" /&gt;  Independent game developer [[Comma 8 Studios]] announced ''[[M.U.L.E. Returns]]'', a licensed remake of the 1983 classic ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' slated for release in 2013.&lt;ref name="brudzynski" /&gt;

===2013===

World of Commodore 2013 was organized by [[TPUG]] and held at the Admiral Inn in Mississauga, Ontario on 7 December.&lt;ref name="woc2013" /&gt;  The event hosted Comma 8 Studios's launch of ''M.U.L.E. Returns'', the [[iOS]] remake of ''M.U.L.E.'' which had been announced at the previous World of Commodore expo.&lt;ref name="woc2013" /&gt;

Since the early 1990s Kovalchuk has owned a [[dacha]] in Solovyovka in the [[Priozersky District]] of the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]], located on the eastern shore of the Komsomolskoye lake on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] near St. Petersburg. His neighbours there are [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Vladimir Yakunin]], [[Andrei Aleksandrovich Fursenko|Andrei Fursenko]], [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Viktor Myachin]], [[Vladimir Smirnov (businessman)|Vladimir Smirnov]] and [[Nikolay Shamalov]]. Together they instituted the co-operative society [[Ozero]] (the Lake) which united their properties on 10 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/how-the-1980s-explains-vladimir-putin/273135/#  How the 1980s Explains Vladimir Putin.

His elder brother [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]] is the scientific secretary of the Council for Science and High Technologies attached to the president of the [[Russian Federation]].

In 2015 Yury Kovalchuk's National Media Group (NMG) and US Discovery channel joined forces to form Media Alliance  of which NMG owns 80% &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/billionaire-kovalchuks-national-media-group-to-buy-russian-distributor-of-cnn-51323|title=Billionaire Kovalchuk's National Media Group to Buy Russian Distributor of CNN|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Later that year, Kovalchuk acquired the rights to Ted Turner’s Russian assets including the Russian version of CNN, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. The reason for the sale was based on the Russian media ownership law that limits ownership of Russian media by foreigners. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianbusinessbriefing.com/billionaire-kovalchuk/|title=‘Putin’s personal banker’ Kovalchuk to buy CNN Russia as Turner moves out|date=2015-12-24|work=Eurasian Business Briefing - Information for Investors|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Kovalchuk purchased the century-old Novy Svet vineyard in the Crimean Peninsula for $26.4 million in one of the first privatization deals in the region since the annexation of the region by Russia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/putin-ally-targeted-by-us-sanctions-buys-winery-in-crimea-60001|title=Putin Ally Targeted by U.S. Sanctions Buys Winery in Crimea|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
