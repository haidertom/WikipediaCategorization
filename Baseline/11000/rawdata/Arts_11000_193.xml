'''African folk art''' (see also [[Tribal art]]) consists of a wide variety of items: household objects, metal objects, toys, textiles, masks, and wood sculpture, among others.
[[File:African Sudan Art Basket-Tray.jpg|thumb|SUDAN basket -tray, tabar of weaved natural plant fibre, coloured in different colours]]

==Metal objects==

Metal objects have many functions and meanings in [[Africa]] where forging has been regarded as an almost magical, transformative process that is likened to the creation of life itself. Ceremonial pieces, often based on utilitarian forms such as the agricultural hoe, an [[iwenga]] from the [[Nkutshu]] people of southeastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], were used as special-purpose currency. Not everyday money, this currency was exchanged in the course of a significant social transaction such as marriage. Utilitarian, symbolic, and decorative; cultural significance is hammered into the products of the forge with every blow.

In [[Senegal]], metal objects are recycled as utilitarian African folk art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moifa.org/exhibitions/past/recycledreseen/globalmarketpage.html Recycling in the Global Marketplace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302145030/http://www.moifa.org/exhibitions/past/recycledreseen/globalmarketpage.html |date=March 2, 2007 }}, [[Museum of International Folk Art]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery==

Pottery is made all over the continent of Africa for functional and ritual use. Pottery, along with basketry vessels, was essential to carry and store food and water. Collecting interests includes [[Zambia]]n pottery with its beautifully proportioned clay bodies decorated with fine lines that form a decorative geometric pattern. Today in Zambia, most pottery has been replaced by sheet metal and plastic, materials that are more durable and less expensive but also less attractive than a handmade clay jar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-african-art.com/african-folk-art.html African folk art illustrates the traditions, political systems and spirituality of tribal villages], [http://www.all-about-african-art.com/ All-About-African-Art.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textiles==

The [[Shoowa]] people, a small population on the northwestern fringe of the [[Bushoong]] kingdom, Congo, have created visually delightful and colorful ''ceremonial panels'' that combine tradition and innovation in a complex artistic fashion. In spite of maintaining a different language and loose political ties, the Shoowa share many cultural practices with the peoples of the Bushoong kingdom.

'''Ceremonial Panel — 1885–1910'''

An early example of Shoowa textiles is the Ceremonial Panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0112.jpg Ceremonial Panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012501/http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0112.jpg |date=September 27, 2007 }}, 1885–1910.&lt;/ref&gt; This piece dates from 1885–1910, and is 17" × 59" (41.91&amp;nbsp;cm × 149.86&amp;nbsp;cm) in size. This ancient cloth is composed of two pieces joined across the center; and bordered by pompoms, a technique reported for textiles on the Kongo coast in the seventeenth century. The basic weave is typical for Shoowa with close warps and weft of similar thickness and even distribution. The designs are shaped by two embroidery techniques: lines of stem stitching and cut-pile. To create the plush effect, an embroiderer twists a strand of raffia into an iron needle which she inserts between the warp and weft, leaving a short tuft. After pulling the fiber strand through to about two millimeters in height, she cuts it with a narrow knife held vertically in the same hand and brushes both ends.

'''Ceremonial Panel — 1910–1930'''

A second example of the Ceremonial Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0186.jpg Ceremonial Panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012514/http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0186.jpg |date=September 27, 2007 }}, 1910–1930.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Shoowa people, made of woven raffia palm fiber, cut pile and linear embroidery, dating from 1910–1930, is 23" × 24" (58.2 × 59.69&amp;nbsp;cm) in size. This piece is a classic model of quality for a mid-century Shoowa cloth. It retains the major features of the late 19th century style and fine workmanship. Unlike the Bushoong, the Shoowa typically, as here, dye the foundation cloth red before embroidery and execute their designs in natural beige and dark brown. The pattern of two wide columns of interlacing is a long-standing favorite Shoowa theme. The manner in which the broad columnar outlines are formed by multiple dark and light rows of stem stitching, interspersed with tiny light and dark plush motifs, called tunjoko, is another characteristic of Shoowa style. Because of the subtle distribution of light and dark across the surface, there is a convincing sense of balance despite the asymmetry.

'''Ceremonial Panel — 1950–1975'''

A third example of the Ceremonial Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0257.jpg Ceremonial Panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012535/http://www.internationalfolkart.org/about/treasurechest/closerlook/htm/html_full/images_full/0257.jpg |date=September 27, 2007 }}, 1950–1975.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Shoowa people, also made of woven raffia palm fiber, cut-pile and linear embroidery, dating from 1950–1975, is 24" × 24 1/4" (60.96&amp;nbsp;cm. × 6l.28&amp;nbsp;cm.) in size. The colorful dots (diamonds, rectangles, triangles) belong to the familiar tiny tunjoko designs seen in many Shoowa cloths. However here, instead of filling in the intervals between major motifs, they become the principal designs that fill the entire cloth. Intruding upon this dot-filled ground we see a grid of squares drawn by multiple, fine, dark-and-light embroidered lines. In front of this grid two large vertical interlace designs begin at the bottom as thin curved forms and rise crisscrossing to the top.

==Museums==

The [[Museum of International Folk Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moifa.org/ Museum of International Folk Art], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, has an African Folk Art collection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moifa.org/collections/coll-african.html African Folk Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516124415/http://www.moifa.org/collections/coll-african.html |date=May 16, 2007 }}, Museum of International Folk Art.&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of household objects, toys, and textiles as well as masks and wood sculpture. An anonymous gift of over 40 pieces of pottery increased the geographic representation of the holdings. [[Alexander Girard]] donated many small figures and toys of wood while toys made from wire and recycled materials were collected for the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moifa.org/exhibitions/past/recycledreseen/rrindex.html Recycled Re-Seen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301011657/http://www.moifa.org/exhibitions/past/recycledreseen/rrindex.html |date=March 1, 2007 }}, Museum of International Folk Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent acquisition and ongoing collecting area is metalwork from Africa. Metal objects represent a rich area for interpretation because their manufacture and use encompasses the development of technology, trade, adornment, ritual and religion, and core cultural values.

The '''Archbishop's Chapel'''  (or '''Archiepiscopal Chapel''') is a [[chapel]] on the first floor of the bishops' palace in [[Ravenna]], Italy, the smallest of the famous [[mosaic]] sites of the city. It is a private [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] bishops dating from the turn of the 6th century. Although commonly attributed to St. [[Peter Chrysologus]], [[Archbishop of Ravenna]] from 433&amp;ndash;450, the chapel was actually built by [[Peter II of Ravenna|Peter II]] shortly after he became archbishop in 495.  The mosaics date from the original construction, or soon after.

==Description==
The tiny cruciform chapel is currently dedicated to [[Saint Andrew]], although the original dedication was to the [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|Saviour]], as evidenced by a [[lunette]] over the [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] door representing [[Christ treading on the beasts]], dressed as a general or victorious Emperor.  The lower parts of the walls are lined with marble slabs, while the rest of the interior used to be covered with rich, tapestry-like [[mosaic]]s, as the vault still is.  Some parts of these survive, while others were substituted with [[tempera]] paintings by [[Luca Longhi]] in the 16th century.

==Significance==
According to the [[ICOMOS]] evaluation of this [[World Heritage Site]], "the significance of this property is the fact that it is the only Early Christian private [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] that has survived to the present day. Its [[iconography]] is also important by virtue of its strongly anti-[[Arianism|Arian]] symbolism".[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/788.pdf]

The '''Au Pairs''' were a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[post-punk]] band that formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1978 and continued until 1983.  They produced two studio albums and three singles.  Their songs were said to have "contempt for the cliches of contemporary sexual politics"&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news| author= Matt Seaton| title      = Old music: Au Pairs – It's Obvious| date       = 6 October 2011| publisher  = [[The Guardian]]| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/old-music-au-pairs-obvious| accessdate = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their music has been compared to the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and the [[Young Marble Giants]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news| author  = John Rockwell| title      = POP: PIGBAG, AU PAIRS| date       = 28 September 1981| work=[[The New York Times]]| url        = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/28/arts/pop-pigbag-au-pairs.html| accessdate = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was led by Lesley Woods, who was once described as "one of the most striking women in British rock".&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news| author  = Craig Lee| title      = 3 JOHNS AT FENDER'S ADD UP TO A VERY GOOD TIME| date       = 21 June 1985| publisher  = [[Los Angeles Times]]| url        = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/154284291.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun%2021,%201985&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=POP%20MUSIC%20REVIEW| accessdate = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Their first album ''[[Playing with a Different Sex]]'' is considered a post-punk classic with strong, sarcastic songs like "It's Obvious" and "We're So Cool" taking a dry look at gender relations. Other songs, such as "Armagh" with its refrain, "we don't torture" criticized the British government's treatment of Irish Republican prisoners in the then ongoing [[The Troubles|troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], which caused some controversy at the time.

The band performed in 1980 for the [[concert film]] ''[[Urgh! A Music War]]''.

The band's second album, ''Sense and Sensuality'' (1982), showed a greater influence of [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] on the band's sound, but was less well received.&lt;ref name=amg&gt;{{cite news| author     = Richie Unterberger

| accessdate = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of Jane Munro in 1983, the band recruited Nick O'Connor who also played piano and synthesizers. At this time the group were further augmented by Jayne Morris (percussion and backing vocals), Graeme Hamilton (trumpet) and Cara Tivey on additional keyboards.  The band broke up in 1983, just before they began recording a third album with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]].

Woods formed an all-woman band called the Darlings in the late 1980s, but then left the [[music industry]]. She now works as a lawyer in London.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lesleylonghurstwoods.co.uk/| title = Barrister at Law London
| publisher = Lesley Longhurst-Woods| date = 2012-01-06| accessdate = 2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist Paul Foad published a guitar technique book, co-written with Stuart Ritchie, titled ''The Caged Guitarist'' (2000). Bass player Jane Munro works as an alternative therapist (aromatherapy, reflexology and Indian head massage) in Birmingham. Pete Hammond also remains an active musician and teaches percussion in Birmingham.

==Reception==
In a review of the band's debut show at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], critic Richard Cromelin said: "When the crowd at the Whisky kept calling Au Pairs back to the stage for encores Wednesday night, it was as if they were trying to tell the group's singer Lesley Woods that her band had done just fine and she could go ahead and loosen up a little." (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 1981)&lt;ref name=cromelin&gt;{{cite news|author = Richard Cromelin| title  = Au Pairs Debuts at the Whisky| date  = 2 October 1981| publisher  = [[Los Angeles Times]]| url        = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/152956621.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct%202,%201981&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=AU%20PAIRS%20DEBUTS%20AT%20THE%20WHISKY| accessdate = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=November 2017}}

Writing about their show at [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]], John Rockwell said "The Au Pairs blend political lyrics, a tough, funk-dance-rock idiom and an at least initially dispassionate vocal style, rather like the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] meeting the [[Young Marble Giants]]" and suggested that Lesley Woods "and the band were able to build the insinuating monotones of the songs early in the set through street taunts into a rousing rock-and-roll climax." (''[[The New York Times]]'', 1981)&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Music historian Gillian G. Gaar noted in her 2002 ''She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock and Roll (Live Girls)'' that the band mingled male and female musicians in a revolutionary collaborative way, as part of its outspoken explorations of sexual politics.&lt;ref name=gaar&gt;{{cite book| author = Gillian G.

'''Berthe Hoola van Nooten''' (née Bartha Hendrica Philippina van Dolder; 12 October 1817 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] – 12 April 1892 in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]), was a Dutch botanical artist, noted for her botanical plates illustrating ''"Fleurs, Fruits et Feuillages Choisis de l'Ile de Java"'' in 1863-64.

==Life==
Berthe was the daughter of Johannes Wilhelmus van Dolder, a vicar, and his wife Philippina Maria Batenburg. On 11 July 1838 in [[Wageningen]], she married Dirk Hoola van Nooten, a judge in [[Paramaribo]]. Interested in [[botany]], she regularly sent specimens of cultivated plants to botanical gardens in the Netherlands, collected on trips through [[Suriname]] with her husband. She and her husband later moved to New Orleans where they established a female seminary connected to the Protestant Episcopal Church. Personal tragedy struck with her husband's death from yellow fever in 1847, leaving her with a young family of five. She was judged competent by the church and allowed to continue the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Louisiana (1848)&lt;/ref&gt; After a stay in Europe the New Orleans female seminary was re-established in Plaquemine, parish of Iberville, Louisiana, in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Times Picayune, published as The Daily Picayune; Date: 05-07-1850; Page: 8&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to Galveston. In January 1854 ''The Galveston News'' reported that Mrs. van Nooten's Young Ladies Institute, for which she purchased a 'large and handsome residence,' was operational. In October and November 1855 however the same paper published repeated court orders for B. H. van Nooten, who had argued she was not a resident of Texas, to appear for the Justice of the Peace to answer to creditors. Next we hear of her on the island of Java, to which she travelled with her brother, who was a highly successful merchant in the business of sugar, machines and life insurance. Having arrived in Java she applied for a Government subsidy for setting up a Protestant female seminary to countenance the influence of Roman Catholic seminaries. Probably being refused such support and aware of the vogue in Europe for lavish illustrations of exotic ''flora'', she set about producing 40 plates depicting interesting plant species from Java in which pursuit she followed the precedents set by [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and [[Elizabeth Blackwell]].

Her attempts to publish the work were unsuccessful until she acquired the patronage of [[Sophie of Württemberg|Sophia Mathilde]], wife of [[King William III of the Netherlands]]. The exceptionally well executed [[chromolithographs]] were done by Pieter De [[Pannemaeker]], the Belgian lithographer operating from [[Ledeberg]] in [[Ghent]]. ''"Van Nooten was clearly a more than competent artist, for the splendid tropical plants, with their lush foliage, vividly coloured flowers and exotic fruit, have been depicted with great skill. She managed to accentuate the splendour of each species by adopting a style that combined great precision and clarity with a touch of neo-Baroque exuberance, reveling in the rich forms and colours of the tropics. The reader's eye is immediately captured by the dark leaves, shown furled or crumpled or partly nibbled away by insects, the delicately rendered details of the follicles and seeds, and the heavy clusters of flowers that cascade down the page. The excellent reproduction of the artist's drawings in the form of chromolithographs lends a tactile quality to these striking images."'' — Lucia Tongiorgi Tomasi, ''An Oak Spring Flora.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomasi|first=Lucia Tongiorgi|title=An Oak Spring Flora: Flower Illustration from the Fifteenth Century to the Present Time: A Selection of the Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Works of Art in the Collection of Rachel Lambert Mellon|location=Upperville, Va.; New Haven, Conn.|publisher=Oak Spring Garden Library; distributed by [[Yale University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-300-07139-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the book was published in a number of editions, Hoola van Nooten died in poverty in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] at the age of 74. The Hoola van Nooten family name is today respected in the Netherlands, and is listed in the [[:nl:Nederlands Patriciaat|Nederlands Patriciaat]], a register of Dutch families who have played a significant role in Dutch society over the past 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/issues/98/story09.html|title=National Library Acquires Rare Botanical Work by Dutch Female Artist - GATEWAYS - National Library of Australia|website=www.nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)''''' is an oil painting by American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It depicts a [[catboat]] called the ''Gloucester'' chopping through that city's harbor under "a fair wind" (Homer's original title). Inside the boat are a man, three boys, and their catch. 

Homer began the canvas in New York in 1873, after he had visited [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], where he first worked in watercolor. He used the sketches made there, of which the most closely related is ''Sailing the Catboat'' (1873), for the oil painting, which he worked on over three years.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;Cikovsky, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Infrared [[reflectography]] has revealed the many changes he made to the composition during this time, including the removal of a fourth boy near the mast and a second schooner in the distance. At one point the adult held both the sheet and the [[tiller]], a position initially adapted from an oil study of 1874 titled ''The Flirt''.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;Cikovsky, 143&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's message is positive; despite the choppy waves, the boaters look relaxed. The anchor that replaced the boy in the bow was understood to symbolize hope.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 144&lt;/ref&gt; The boy holding the tiller looks forward to the horizon, a statement of optimism about his future and that of the young United States. 

The finished work indicates that the significant influence of [[Japanese art]] on Western painters in the 19th century also touched Homer, particularly in the compositional balance between the left (active) and right (sparse) halves. Homer had visited France in 1866 and 1867, and the influence of marine scenes by the French painters [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Claude Monet]] is apparent as well. Not all of Homer's sea pictures are so benevolent as ''Breezing Up'': he portrayed [[commons:File:Northeaster by Winslow Homer 1895.jpg|waves crashing ashore]] as did Courbet (see for example ''[[:commons:File:Brooklyn Museum - The Wave (La Vague) - Gustave Courbet.jpg|The Wave]]'', c. 1869). Monet's relatively early paintings ''[[commons:File:Claude Monet Seascape Storm.jpeg|Seascape: Storm]]'' (1867) and ''[[commons:File:Monet-The-Green-Wave-1866.jpg|The Green Wave]]'' (1866) show boats on somewhat turbulent seas.


[[File:Winslow Homer - The Gulf Stream - Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Gulf Stream (painting)|The Gulf Stream]]'', Winslow Homer, 1899. ''Breezing Up'' has been called "the one painting among all of Homer's earlier works positioned most squarely in the lineage of ''The Gulf Stream''"; the sense of hope in ''Breezing Up'' is replaced by apparent pessimism in the later work.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 383&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Completed in the centennial year 1876, the painting was first exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]] that year, then at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. By 1879, it had come to be known as ''Breezing Up'', a title that was not the artist's but one which he did not seem to object to. A contemporary critic described the painting: "It is painted in [Homer's] customary coarse and negligé style, but suggests with unmistakable force the life and motion of a breezy summer day off the coast. The fishing boat, bending to the wind, seems actually to cleave the waves. There is no truer or heartier work in the exhibition."&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed critic quoted in Hand, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote, "Much has already been said in praise of the easy, elastic motion of the figures of the party in the sailboat, which is scudding along through blue water under 'a fair wind.' They sway with the rolling boat, and relax or grow rigid as the light keel rises or sinks upon the waves. Every person who has been similarly situated can recall how, involuntarily, his back stiffened or his knees bent as he felt the roll of the waves beneath him."&lt;ref&gt;''Appleton's Journal'' critic&lt;!--footnote not accessible on Google Books--&gt; quoted in Johns, Elizabeth (2002). ''Winslow Homer: the nature of observation'', University of California Press, pp. 77–78. {{ISBN|0-520-22725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, ''Breezing Up'' is considered an iconic American painting, and among Homer's finest.&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;Hand, 259&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Gallery of Art]] purchased the work in 1943, described by the institution's web site as "one of the best-known and most beloved artistic images of life in nineteenth-century America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=30228 ''Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506213405/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=30228# |date=2009-05-06 }}, National Gallery of Art web site.

An '''architectural brief''' is a statement of a client's requirements, which form the basis for appointing an [[architect]]. The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. 
The term '''program''' is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a [[synonym]] of, an "architectural brief". "Program" is used more often in the United States whereas 'brief' is used more outside the United States, internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/o/ogorman-abc.html |title=ABC of Architecture |last1=O'Gorman |first1=James |date=1998 |work=New York Times |access-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the brief==
The architectural brief is often formulated by, or in collaboration with, the architect. It often includes [[SWOT analysis|opportunities assessed, constraints identified]] and needs for further investigation clarified.

In the early stages of the design process the brief may be continuously reappraised as the requirements become clearer - this is known as 'firming up the brief'. Ultimately, a clear set of instructions setting out the overarching goals and  detailed requirements will emerge which form the starting point of the architect's designs and will be continually tested against, as designs are progressed.

==Schedule of accommodation==
In the later stages of writing a brief, a '''schedule of accommodation''' is sometimes drawn up that will specify precisely the number and size of rooms that will be required, the relationships between rooms and groups of rooms, the finishes, equipment, furniture that will fit the room for its functional purpose and the environmental conditions that will assist the purpose. Environmental conditions might include temperature range, humidity, air movement, acoustic isolation, etc..The schedule of accommodation is prepared by an expert to help in determining the minimum space required on site to develop and finish a given design .The schedule of accommodation is guided by the brief analysis of every space since every space have set standards and requirement.

==Complex briefs==
For complex facilities, the brief may be prepared by a specialist consultant, separate from the design architect. In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, [[Facility management|facility experts]], [[General contractor|builders/contractors]] and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief.

If the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made.

The information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs.

Parameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor [[Structural load|loading]], [[Flooring#Flooring materials|floor finish]] and [[Skirting board|skirting]] requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]], water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety.

A thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub-functions and then to activities. A '[[functional brief]]' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options.

==Evaluation==
For critical facilities, the [[project manager]] or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief. This avoids misunderstanding of drawings that can arise when non-experts are asked to review them. A graphical validation might include demonstration of the movement expected between spaces, and show how a proximity diagram is modeled onto the design layout.

The '''British Institution''' (in full, the '''British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom'''; founded 1805, disbanded 1867) was a private 19th-century society in [[London]] formed to exhibit the works of living and dead artists;&lt;ref name=SurveyofLondon_2930&gt;{{Citation|contribution=Pall Mall, North Side, Past Buildings|title=Survey of London: volumes 29 and 30: St James Westminster, Part 1|pages=325–338|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40580|year=1960|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also known as the '''Pall Mall Picture Galleries''' or the '''British Gallery'''.  Unlike the [[Royal Academy]] it admitted only connoisseurs, dominated by the nobility, rather than practicing artists to its membership, which along with its conservative taste led to tensions with the [[British art]]ists it was intended to encourage and support. In its gallery in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] the Institution held the world's first regular temporary exhibitions of Old Master paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Conlin, Jonathan (2006). ''The Nation's Mantelpiece: A history of the National Gallery''. London: Pallas Athene,, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; which alternated with sale exhibitions of the work of living artists; both quickly established themselves as popular parts of the London social and artistic calendar.  From 1807 prizes were given to artists and surplus funds were used to buy paintings for the nation.

==Founding==
[[File:John Jackson01.jpg|thumb|280px|Portrait of [[William Seguier]], the first Superintendent, in 1830 by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]]]]
The British Institution was founded in June 1805 by a group of private subscribers who met in the Thatched House Tavern in London. A committee was formed, and in September of that year it purchased the lease of the former [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]] building at 52 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], with 62 years remaining, for a premium of £4,500 and an annual [[ground rent]] of £125.  The British Institution opened at the Pall Mall site on 18 January 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding "Hereditory Governors" included [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet]] and [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough]], both of whom had employed the services of the leading dealer and picture-cleaner [[William Seguier]], and were probably responsible for his appointment as "Superintendent".  Seguier later became [[Surveyor of the King's Pictures]] and when the [[National Gallery, London]] was founded in 1824, was appointed as the first Keeper, holding all three positions until his death in 1843, as well as continuing to run his business.  Above Seguier the Institution had a Keeper, a role given to a series of engravers.  The Superintendent was responsible for organizing and hanging the shows, a role that inevitably gave rise to grumbling and worse from artists – at the [[Royal Academy]] a committee was responsible for the hang, which allowed someone else to be blamed, but Seguier had no such opportunity to share the blame.  In 1833 [[John Constable]] wrote with heavy irony of having received a visit in his studio from "a much greater man than the King—the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]]—[[Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster|Lord Westminster]]—[[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont|Lord Egremont]], or the [[President of the Royal Academy]] — "MR SEGUIER"."  When in 1832 two pictures by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], who had been dead only four years, were included in an "Old Masters" exhibition, Constable (who was twenty-six years older than Bonington) wrote that Seguier was "carrying on a Humbugg".&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 388–391; quotes 391&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other founding Governors included [[George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth]] as President, the [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|Marquess of Stafford]], [[Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet]], [[William Holwell Carr]], [[John Julius Angerstein]], [[Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet]], [[Sir Thomas Bernard, 3rd Baronet]], and others.  They were essentially the same group who were to succeed in persuading the government to found the National Gallery in 1824, and whose gifts to it provided most of the early collection.  There was a total group of 125 Governors, Directors and Subscribers, paying sums between 100 guineas (56 of them, 35 at 50g., 11 at 10g.) down to one guinea annually. In 1805 the initial subscribers consisted of "One duke, five marquesses, fourteen earls, two viscounts, nine lords, two bishops, four ladies, seven baronets, twenty-two members of parliament, five clergymen and above fifty private gentlemen, bankers and merchants".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institution had been discussed with the Royal Academy before it was established, and relations were friendly, at least initially, though later there were to be tensions.  The [[Prince Regent]] was Patron from the foundation, and loans from the [[Royal Collection]] continued throughout the life of the Institution.  In 1822 the hereditary nature of the Governors was eased out, as they were becoming far too numerous, and the bottom end of the Subscribership tightened up.&lt;ref&gt;For details of the complicated membership see Smith, who appears to quote original minutes; sources differ at various points on matters of detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The gallery building had been commissioned in 1788 by the engraver and print publisher [[John Boydell]] as a showroom for his [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]], a large and financially unsuccessful project for a series of paintings and prints of scenes from works by [[William Shakespeare]]. The architect was [[George Dance the Younger]], the then clerk of the city works. The gallery had a monumental, [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] stone-built front, and three exhibition rooms on the first floor, with a total of more than {{convert|4000|sqft|m2}} of wall space for displaying pictures.&lt;ref name=SurveyofLondon_2930/&gt; Boydell ran up large debts in producing his Shakespeare engravings, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1804 to dispose of the gallery and other property by [[lottery]]. The main prize winner, [[William Tassie]], a modeller and maker of replica [[engraved gem]]s, then sold the gallery property and contents at auction. When the British Institution took possession, they also retained a sculptural group on the façade by [[Thomas Banks]], which had been intended to be used as a monument on Boydell's tomb.&lt;ref name=SurveyofLondon_2930/&gt;

==Modern exhibitions==
[[File:The Death of the Earl of Chatham by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|left|''The Collapse of the Earl of Chatham in the House of Lords, 7 July 1778'' by [[John Singleton Copley]]; exhibited in the first exhibition, although over 20 years old.]]
The price of admission remained one shilling throughout the life of the Institution. There were some private openings in the evenings, for members and (separately) exhibitors, these being divided into two by splitting the alphabet.  The number of modern works exhibited grew within a few years to over 500.  The first exhibition contained 257 works (including sculptures and some enamels and miniatures) with a good selection of the leading British artists, including (selecting on their modern rather than contemporary reputations) two Turners, two Stubbs paintings and five enamels, fourteen [[Benjamin West]]s, four Paul Sandby's, two by Thomas Lawrence, one a huge history painting, three Copleys including his ''Death of Chatham'', four James Wards, as well as 24 pictures from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' by Robert Smirke, who was to turn against the Institution.  

Within a few years the number of works regularly reached over 500, and many had to be rejected. The 1806 receipts for the shilling entries were £534 &amp; 4s implying 10,684 paying visitors above the members and their guests.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 22–39, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 the Institution announced that in its first four years a total of 424 works had been sold, raising £20,900 for the artists (the Institution took no cut of sales); by 1826 this cumulative figure was over £75,000.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 53, 88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 the [[Emperor of Russia]] and King of Prussia were among the visitors, apparently without buying.
[[File:Parmigianino - The Vision of St Jerome - WGA17044.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Vision of Saint Jerome]]'' by [[Parmigianino]], bought in 1823 for £3,302 for presentation to the [[National Gallery]]]]
Perhaps because many large [[history painting]]s were submitted, and indeed encouraged by the Institution, the number of works included fell in the late 1810s: in 1818 309 were exhibited and 65 sold, for £2,623, typical for these years, though from 1828 there were usually over 500 until the late 1830s after which numbers in the mid-400s were typical until about 1850, when they rose again.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 75–76; 90&lt;/ref&gt; The Institution largely remained faithful to the [[hierarchy of genres]] and saw the encouragement of history painting as an aim, especially as opposed to portraits, traditionally the mainstay of the British market. Its exhibitions were by 1850 falling behind developments in [[British art]]; few [[Pre-Raphaelite]] works were exhibited there, though [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s oval Hampstead landscape was seen and disliked there by [[John Ruskin]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pre-Raphaelites'', 110–111, Tate exhibition catalogue, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patronage==
After the first exhibition the gallery was kept open as a free school for artists, with members lending a variety of Old Masters for them to copy; at this stage the public could not see these displays.  From 1807 a number of prizes of £100 or £50 were given to students at the school who painted the best companion pieces to works by Old Masters on display at the gallery. These were later increased and extended to other artists, reaching 300, 200 and 100 guineas by 1811.  

The Institution commissioned or bought a number of paintings which were presented to the National Gallery, and some other institutions. In 1826 they presented the ''[[Vision of Saint Jerome]]'' or ''Madonna and Child with Saints'' by [[Parmigianino]] (bought in 1823 for £3,302), the ''Consecration of Saint Nicholas'' by [[Paolo Veronese]] (bought in 1811 for £1,575),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 63, 84&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1830 the ''Market Cart'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] (bt 1829, Lord Gwydir's Sale, 1050 gn) and a ''Holy Family'' by Reynolds (same, 1950 gn.).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern works included [[Benjamin West]]'s ''Christ Healing the Sick in the Temple'', for which the very high price of 3,000 guineas was paid, though this was more than recouped by sales of an engraving commissioned by the Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 61–62 and 64, who gives good details of the large sums involved in print-publishing at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given to the National Gallery, but later transferred along with their British collection to what is now [[Tate Britain]].

In 1814 ''Mary anointing the Feet of Christ'' by [[William Hilton]] was bought for 550 gn. and given to a church in the City.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 67&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year 1,000 gn was set aside for premiums for [[oil sketch]]es of subjects showing "the successes of the British Army in Spain, Portugal or France", producing many submissions the following year, for which two 150 gn. premiums were awarded, and James Ward commissioned for 1,000 gn to do a full-size version of his ''[[Allegory of Waterloo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 70–74&lt;/ref&gt; Another Waterloo work was given to the [[Royal Hospital, Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious paintings were bought for London churches, and a new competition announced for two works on Nelson's victories to be given to [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]]. In 1826 the Institution announced that nearly £5,000 in premiums, and over £14,000 on purchases had been spent to date, but from the 1830s the number and size of premiums slackens and the last premiums were in 1842, after which sums like £50 were given to artists' charities instead, and in later years no donations are recorded.  In 1850 the Institution recorded a total of £28,515 in purchases, prizes and donations since 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 89, and following; tables 133–136&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1850s the overall prosperity of the market for contemporary paintings had hugely increased.

==Heyday of the Institution==
[[File:British Institution (Pall Mall) by Rudolph Ackermann.jpg|left|thumb|The British Institution (Pall Mall) by [[Rudolph Ackermann]] – 1808, with artists copying works]]
The Old Masters exhibitions were mainly loans from the members.  The first was in 1813, entirely consisting of 143 works by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], and the next year 53 William Hogarths, 73 Gainsboroughs, 85 Richard Wilsons and 12 by Zoffany were shown.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 154–156&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1815 for the first time the Institution showed foreign art – Dutch and Flemish – and upset many British artists by a preface to the catalogue, implying in a rather too patronizing manner that British artists had a lot to learn from them. [[Robert Smirke (painter)|Robert Smirke]] is generally accepted as the anonymous author of a series of satirical "''Catalogues Raisonnés''" published in 1815–16, which savagely lampooned the Directors, the great and the good of British art patronage. [[William Hazlitt]] rejoined with a long piece of laboured sarcasm in defence of the Institution. At this time the Old Masters were exhibited in the winter, and the living artists in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 382&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 Italian and Spanish works were shown, including two of the [[Raphael Cartoons]] and several important works from the [[Orleans Collection]]; most of the consortium who had split this up were Directors of the Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; 

The foreign schools rotated until 1825 when only selected loaned works by living British artists were shown, and for the next two years only works from the Royal Collection, essentially the new collections of the Prince Regent, by now King George IV.  In 1830 all 91 works were by the recently dead Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], including all the pictures from the Waterloo Gallery at [[Windsor Castle]]; his nieces received the £3,000 of ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 177–179&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Salvator Rosa (Italian) - Allegory of Fortune - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Allegory of Fortune]]'' by [[Salvator Rosa]], shown in 1859, when owned by the [[Duke of Beaufort]]. It was then apparently never exhibited in England until 2010, by which time it belonged to the [[Getty Museum]]]]

In 1838 the living French artist [[Paul Delaroche]] was treated as an Old Master to allow exhibition of two of his large works on British history including ''[[Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers]]''.  In 1848 the designation was extended in the other direction with a group of early masters including [[Giotto]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] (attributions that perhaps would not be maintained today).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 195–197&lt;/ref&gt; This was still somewhat bold for the time. The 1851 show, coinciding with vast numbers of tourists flocking to the [[Great Exhibition]], had 120 pictures from 47 collections, intended to show the cream of British collections.

Later, by 1832 as reported by [[Johann David Passavant|Passavant]], the Institution's routine was to hold a spring exhibition of paintings by contemporary artists, available for purchase, followed by a summer exhibition of old masters. By the time of an 1835 visit by [[Thomas Carlyle]], the gallery had become known colloquially as the ''Pall Mall Picture Galleries'' or the ''British Gallery'', and was still among the popular society haunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/full/8/1/lt-18350110-TC-WG-01?|title=Letter to William Graham|first=Thomas|last=Carlyle|doi=10.1215/lt-18350110-TC-WG-01|date=10 January 1835|accessdate=2007-11-16|journal=The Carlyle Letters Online|volume=8|issue=1|page=5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203142538/http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/full/8/1/lt-18350110-TC-WG-01|archivedate=3 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' called it "the favourite lounge of the nobility and gentry", and artists grumbled that it imposed aristocratic tastes on the viewing public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0sj2qmBsYC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22British+Institution%22+Taylor&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E5ERTbXrDMSwhQeVkrG3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Art for the Nation, 30]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tourist guides in the 1840s reported that the spring exhibition ran from the start of February to the first week of May, closing a week after the Royal Academy exhibition opened, and the old masters exhibition from the first week of June to the end of August, with some works remaining in the galleries for a month or more for artists to copy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mogg|first=Edward|title=Mogg's New Picture of London, or Strangers' Guide to the British Metropolis|location=London|year=1848|edition=11|pages=2, 170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=mogg's%20new%20picture&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=|oclc=23737227|publisher=s.n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vieux-Québec 0024.jpg|thumb|Celtic [[High cross]] in Quebec (Compare with the [[Muiredach's High Cross|original]])]]

The '''Celtic Revival''' (also referred to as the '''Celtic Twilight''' or '''Celtomania''') was a variety of movements and trends in the 19th and 20th centuries that saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture.  Artists and writers drew on the traditions of [[Gaelic literature]], [[Welsh-language literature]], and so-called '[[Celtic art]]'—what historians call [[Insular art]] (the [[Early Medieval]] style of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]). Although the revival was complex and multifaceted, occurring across many fields and in various countries in [[Northwest Europe]], its best known incarnation is probably the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Here, Irish writers including [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]], [[George William Russell|"AE" Russell]], [[Edward Martyn]] and [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Edward Plunkett]] (Lord Dunsany) stimulated a new appreciation of traditional [[Irish literature]] and [[Irish poetry]] in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 486, 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many, but not all, facets the revival came to represent a reaction to [[modernisation]]. This is particularly true in Ireland, where the relationship between the archaic and the modern was antagonistic, where history was fractured, and where, according to [[Terry Eagleton]], "as a whole [the nation] had not leapt at a bound from [[tradition]] to [[modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Castle, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; At times this [[romanticism|romantic]] view of the past resulted in historically inaccurate portrayals, such as the promotion of [[noble savage]] stereotypes of the [[Irish people]] and [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlanders]], as well as a [[racialized]] view that referred to the Irish, whether positively or [[Anti-Irish sentiment|negatively]], as a separate [[Race (human categorization)|race]].&lt;ref name=MacManus1&gt;{{cite book |first=Seamus |last=MacManus |title=The Story of the Irish Race: A Popular History of Ireland |year=1921 |publisher=The Irish Publishing Co |location=Ireland |isbn=0-517-06408-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofirishrace00macmrich |accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widespread and lasting contribution of the revival was the re-introduction of the [[High cross]] as the [[Celtic cross]], which now forms a familiar part of monumental and [[funerary art]] over most of the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts Website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Though, there has been criticism to the unified concept of Celtic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2015/09/there-s-no-such-thing-celt-s-why-we-had-invent-them |title= There’s no such thing as a Celt – that’s why we had to invent them |author= Erica Wagner |publisher= [[New Statesman]] |date= 25 September 2015 |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Antiquary|Antiquarian]] researches into the Gaelic and Brittonic cultures and histories of Britain and Ireland gathered pace from the late 17th century, with people like [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] in [[Wales]] and [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor]] in Ireland. The key surviving manuscript sources were gradually located, edited and translated, monuments identified and published, and other essential groundwork in recording stories, music and language done.

The Welsh antiquarian and author [[Iolo Morganwg]] fed the growing fascination in all things Brittonic by founding the [[Gorsedd]], which (along with his writings) would in turn spark the [[Neo-druidism]] movement.

Interest in [[Scottish Gaelic]] culture greatly increased during the onset of the Romantic period in the late 18th century, with [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'' achieving international fame, along with the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] and the poetry and song lyrics of the London-based Irishman [[Thomas Moore]], [[Byron]]'s friend and executor.  Throughout Europe, the Romantic movement inspired a great revival of interest in [[folklore]], folk tales, and [[folk music]]; even [[Beethoven]]&lt;ref name="Castle, 239"&gt;Castle, 239&lt;/ref&gt; was commissioned to produce a set of arrangements of Scottish folk-songs.  As elsewhere, in what was then the United Kingdom of the whole archipelago, this encouraged and fed off a rise in nationalism, which was especially intense in Ireland.

[[File:Edward Atkinson Hornel - Druids Bringing In The Mistletoe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Druids Bringing in the Mistletoe'' (1890) by [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]]]]
In the mid-19th century the revival continued, with Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]], the [[Young Ireland]] movement, and others popularising folk tales, dubious works of history, and other material in all the nations with a claim to be 'Celtic'. At the same time, archaeological and historical work was beginning to make progress in constructing a better understanding of regional history. Interest in ornamental 'Celtic' art developed, and 'Celtic' motifs began to be used in all sorts of contexts, including architecture, drawing on works like the ''Grammar of Ornament'' by [[Owen Jones (architect)|(another) Owen Jones]].  Imitations of the ornate [[Insular art|Insular]] [[penannular brooch]]es of the 7–9th centuries were worn by [[Queen Victoria]] among others from the late 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about Royal Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042602/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about |date=9 June 2011 }}, Brooch given in November 1849, and [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=4833&amp;row=16&amp;detail=about Christmas 1849].&lt;/ref&gt; many produced in Dublin&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=0&amp;q=penannular+brooch&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= Victorian penannular brooches from the [[V&amp;A Museum]].]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[West Jewellers|West &amp; Son]] and other makers.

In Scotland were [[John Francis Campbell]]'s (1821-1885) works the bilingual [[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]] (4 vols., 1860–62) and The Celtic Dragon Myth, published posthumously in 1911. The formation of the [[Edinburgh Social Union]] in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Craft]] and [[Aesthetic movement]]s, became part of an attempt to facilitate a 'Celtic' Revival in Scotland, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p170&gt;Gardiner (2005), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, (2000), pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant exponent of the artistic revival in Scotland was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945). Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald (2000), pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan also helped to make Dundee a major centre for the Celtic Revival movement along with artists such as [[Stewart Carmichael]] and the publisher Malcolm C MacLeod.&lt;ref name="jarron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jarron|first1=Matthew|title="Independent &amp; Individualist": Art in Dundee 1867-1924|date=2015|publisher=University of Dundee Museum Services / Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-56-2|pages=48–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francis Cargeeg Jar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Modern copper jar, using a Celtic motif in restrained fashion.]]
The [[Irish Literary Revival]] encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of [[Culture of Ireland|Irish culture]], as distinct from [[Culture of England|English culture]]. This was, in part, due to the political need for an individual Irish identity. This difference was kept alive by invoking Ireland's historic past, its [[Irish mythology|myths]], legends and folklore. There was an attempt to re-vitalize the native rhythm and music of Irish Gaelic. Figures such as [[Lady Gregory]], [[WB Yeats]], [[George William Russell|George Russell]], [[John Millington Synge|J .M. Synge]] and [[Seán O'Casey]] wrote many plays and articles about the political state of Ireland at the time. [[Gaelic revival]] and Irish nationalism frequently overlapped in places such as [[An Stad]], a tobacconist on North Frederick Street owned by the writer Cathal McGarvey and frequented by literary figures such as [[James Joyce]] (although Joyce was thoroughly contemptuous of the movement, feeling it betrayed the realities of urban Ireland) and Yeats, along with leaders of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist movement]] such as [[Douglas Hyde]], [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. These were connected with another great symbol of the literary revival, The [[Abbey Theatre]], which served as the stage for many new Irish writers and playwrights of the time.

In 1892, Sir [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A group of young men, among the most generous and disinterested in our annals, were busy digging up the buried relics of our history, to enlighten the present by a knowledge of the past, setting up on their pedestals anew the overthrown statues of Irish worthies, assailing wrongs which under long impunity had become unquestioned and even venerable, and warming as with strong wine the heart of the people, by songs of valour and hope; and happily not standing isolated in their pious work, but encouraged and sustained by just such an army of students and sympathizers as I see here to-day".&lt;ref name="Castle, 239"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Celtic Revival (also often referred to as the "Celtic Twilight") was an international movement. The Irish-American designer [[Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy|Thomas Augustus "Gus" O'Shaughnessy]] made a conscious choice to use Irish design roots as well as Art Nouveau influences in his artwork. Trained in stained glass and working in an Art Nouveau style, O'Shaughnessy designed a series of windows and interior stencils for [[Old St. Patrick's Church (Chicago, Illinois)|Old Saint Patrick's Church]] in Chicago, a project begun in 1912 and completed in 1922.  [[Louis Sullivan]], the Chicago architect, incorporated dense Art Nouveau and 'Celtic'-inspired interlace in the ornament of his buildings. Sullivan's father was a traditional Irish musician and they both were step-dancers, which suggests that his creativity was not rooted only in his official education. In England, the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] (1896–98) in [[Surrey]] was a thoroughgoing attempt to decorate a [[Romanesque Revival]] chapel framework with lavish Celtic reliefs designed by [[Mary Fraser Tytler]]. 
[[File:Tattoo2bg 100599.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic-style tattoo]]
The "plastic style" of early 'Celtic' art was one of the elements feeding into [[Art Nouveau]] decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the [[Isle of Man|Manxman]] [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who did much work for [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], especially for the [[Tudric]] and Cymric ranges of metalwork, respectively in pewter and silver or gold. Many of the most extravagant examples of the plastic style come from the modern [[Czech Lands]] and influenced the Czech Art Nouveau designer and artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (Mucha, in turn, influenced the Irish-American O'Shaughnessy, who had attended a series of Mucha's lectures in Chicago).
[[Interlace (art)|Interlace]], (a.k.a. Entrelac) which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Viking art|Scandinavian]] medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades, it had a re-revival in 1960s designs (for example, in the [[Biba]] logo) and has been used worldwide in tattoos and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] setting. ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the [[Book of Kells]] which makes much use of Insular design.

In France, [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] descriptions of Celtic landscape were found in the works of [[Jacques Cambry]]. The Celtic Revival was strengthened by [[Napoleon]]'s idea that the "French were a race of empire-building Celts," and became institutionalized by the foundation of the [[Societé des Antiquaires de France|Académie Celtique]] in 1805, by Cambry and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Andrew|title=Preserving the provinces: small town and countryside in the work of Honoré de Balzac|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03910-583-0|pages=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC-F05UY7BoC&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] was one of the leading artists of the Celtic Revival and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. He was inspired by the early Italian Renaissance and made works in the medieval medium of tempera. He was a proflic artist working in a range of mediums including stained glass, illustrating and painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/artists/john-duncan|title=John Duncan {{!}} National Galleries of Scotland|website=www.nationalgalleries.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic revivals, after 1920==
===Wales===
The [[Welsh language]] has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, and in recent centuries has been easily the most widely-spoken [[Celtic language]].  But by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7% of the population of Wales spoke Welsh,&lt;ref name="2004Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20&amp;%20Report%2004.pdf|title=2004 Welsh Language Use Survey: the report|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211017/http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20%26%20Report%2004.pdf|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with 20.8% in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], and 18.5% in 1991. The [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The census also showed a "big drop" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50% in [[Ceredigion]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Davies, [[University of Wales Press]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (1993). ''The Welsh Language'', page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population "all but disappeared", but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gpt9T53DDqiPiAfZu4mbCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;f=false | pages = 38–41 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In Wales, 16% of state school pupils now receive a [[Welsh medium education]], and Welsh is a compulsory subject in English medium schools, up to the age of 15-16.

===Irish===
{{Main|Gaelic revival}}
{{see also|Status of the Irish language}} 
Due to the revival of Irish in educational settings and bilingual upbringing, there has been an increase in young Irish people speaking the language in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It is said it is more common to hear it spoken in Irish cities. Additionally, there is a "modest" revived interest in North America in learning Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/a-modest-revival-for-the-irish-language/2012/01/25/gIQABC3ftR_story.html|title= A modest revival for the Irish language|author= Daniel de Vise |publisher= [[The Washington Post]] |date= 5 March 2012|accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] also had its own Celtic revival.&lt;ref name=alberro&gt;{{cite journal|first=Manuel|last=Alberro|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_20/alberro_6_20.html|title=Celtic Legacy in Galicia|journal=E-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies|volume=6|pages=1005–1035|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], all forms of regional culture were suppressed in favor of a unified "Spanish culture" that was heavily based on [[Andalusia#Art and culture|Andalusian culture]] {{cit|date=September 2015}} (although Franco himself was Galician). This lasted until Franco's death in 1975, when the [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King]] was restored to power and all Spanish regional cultures were allowed to flourish once again.

=== Americas ===

==== Welsh in Argentina ====
[[Welsh language|Welsh]] is spoken by over 5,000 people in [[Chubut province]] of [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cym Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; Some districts have recently incorporated it as an educational language.{{sfn|Aeberhard|Benson|Phillips|2000|p=602}}

==== Nova Scotia ====
[[Nova Scotia]] contains the largest population of Celtic people in North America, holding the largest population of [[Scots Gaelic]] speakers outside of Scotland

Also [[Breton language|Breton]] is still spoken to a lesser extent in [[Cape Breton]], it is also home to the only Celtic language outside of Europe, [[Canadian Gaelic]].

The term ''Celtic Revival'' is sometimes used to refer to the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] cultural Celtic revival of the early twentieth century. This was characterised by an increased interest in the [[Cornish language]] started by [[Henry Jenner]] and [[Robert Morton Nance]] in 1904. The [[Federation of Old Cornwall Societies]] was formed in 1924 to "maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall", followed by the [[Gorseth Kernow]] in 1928 and the formation of the Cornish political party [[Mebyon Kernow]] in 1951. This revival has spread towards Northern England, with the attempted reconstructions of numerous types of bagpipe (such as the Lancashire Great-pipe) and an increased interest in the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]]. There are also attempts to reconstruct the [[Cumbric language]], the ancient [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] language of Northern (particularly Northwestern) England, a remnant of the Brittonic kingdoms of [[Hen Ogledd]].

===France===

==== Brittany ====
In 1925, Professor [[Roparz Hemon]] founded the Breton-language review ''[[Gwalarn]].'' During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, ''[[Al Liamm]]'' replaced ''Gwalarn''. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.

In 1977, [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the [[Breton language#Education|education section]] for more information.

The ''[[Asterix]]'' comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the [[Gaul]]ish village where Asterix lives is in the [[Armorica|Armorica peninsula]], which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Spirou et Fantasio|Spirou]]'', ''[[Titeuf]]'', ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Yakari]]''.

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, ''Ken Tuch'', is in Breton. [[Radio Kerne]], broadcasting from [[Finistère]], has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''Marion du Faouet'', ''Sezneg'') and TV series (''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], Anjela Duval, [[Xavier de Langlais]], [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]], [[Youenn Gwernig]], [[Glenmor]] and [[Alan Stivell]] are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] that is not recognized by national government as an official or regional language.

The first Breton dictionary, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Please clarify|clarification needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, ''Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here'' (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

In the early 21st century, the ''[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]'' ("Office of the Breton language") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the [[Spilhennig]] to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an [[Internationalization and localization]] policy asking [[Google]], [[Firefox]] and [[SPIP]] to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the [[Breton Wikipedia]] started, which now counts more than 50,000 articles. In March 2007, the ''Ofis ar Brezhoneg'' signed a tripartite agreement with [[Regional Council of Brittany]] and [[Microsoft]] for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, [[Facebook]] added Breton as one of its 121 languages, after three years of talks between the ''Ofis'' and Facebook.

==== Auvergne ====
In the [[Auvergne (province)]], chants are sung around bonfires remembering a Celtic god. There are also modern attempts to revive the polytheistic religion of the [[Gauls]].

Auvergne is also a hotpot for the Gaulish revival movement, being the location of numerous important Gaulish sites and the home of the legendary Gaulish warrior, [[Vercingetorix]].

Currently 338 people here speak or have some knowledge of the Gaulish language.

==== Other Areas ====
The [[Gaulish language]] used to be widely spoken in France and beyond. In recent times there have been attempts at revivals, despite very limited evidence for the exact original form of the language. [[Eluveitie]] is a metal band whom most of their songs are in a revived Gaulish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/24897674/The_Revival_of_Gaulish_as_a_Modern_Language_Modern_Gaulish_or_Gal%C3%A1thach_hAthev%C3%ADu https://glosbe.com/en/mis_gal academic paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Charles of Bourbon Visiting Pope Benedict XIV at the Coffee House del Quirinale''''' is a painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]], commissioned by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]] in 1746 and completed the same year. It showed and commemorated Charles' visit to Rome after the Bourbon victory over the Austrians at the [[Battle of Velletri (1744)|Battle of Velletri]] in 1744 - he and [[pope Benedict XIV]] were already friends and had signed a Concordat in 1741.

It originally hung in the Capodimonte Palace in Naples and in 1806 was moved to the Palazzo degli Studi. Just before Allied troops arrived in Naples, German soldiers of the [[Hermann Goering Division]] took the painting and presented it to the [[Italian Social Republic]]. It was returned to Naples after the war to join the collection of the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]], where it still hangs with its pair ''[[Charles of Bourbon Visiting St Peter's Basilica]]''.

'''Chelsea College of Arts''' is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]] based in London, UK, and is a leading British art and design institution with an international reputation.&lt;ref name="Best British Art Schools"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4845433.ece |title=Best British Art Schools (The Times) |work= |accessdate=14 May 2009 | location=London | first=Natasha | last=Lennard | date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers [[further education|further]] and higher education courses in fine art, [[graphic design]], interior design, [[spatial design]] and [[textile design]] up to PhD level.

==History==
===Polytechnic===
Chelsea College of Arts was originally an integral school of the '''South-Western Polytechnic''', which opened at Manresa Road, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], in 1895 to provide scientific and technical education to Londoners. Day and evening classes for men and women were held in [[domestic worker|domestic]] economy, mathematics, engineering, [[natural science]], art and music. Art was taught from the beginning of the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]], and included design, [[weaving]], [[embroidery]] and [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]]. The South-Western Polytechnic became the '''Chelsea Polytechnic''' in 1922 and taught a growing number of registered students of the [[University of London]].

At the beginning of the 1930s, the School of Art began to widen, including courses in [[craft]] training and commercial design from 1931. H.S Williamson, the school's appointed headmaster from 1930 to 1958, introduced sculpture shortly after [[World War II]]. Notable artists from this period were employed as teachers such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Graham Sutherland]]. Alumni from this period included [[Elizabeth Frink]], [[Edward Burra]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Ethel Walker]], [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Robert Clatworthy (sculptor)|Robert Clatworthy]], [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] and [[John Berger]].

The School of Science separated and became known as the '''Chelsea College of Science and Technology''' in 1957, and was later admitted as a constituent College of the [[University of London]] in 1966. The Chelsea College of Science and Technology was granted its [[Royal Charter]] in 1971 and merged with [[King's College London]] and [[Queen Elizabeth College]] in 1985.

===Chelsea School of Art===
The School of Art merged with the '''Hammersmith School of Art''', founded by Francis Hawke, to form the '''Chelsea School of Art''' in 1908. The newly formed school was taken over by the [[London County Council]] and a new building erected at Lime Grove, which opened with an extended curriculum. A trade school for girls was erected on the same site in 1914.
[[Image:Chelsea College of Art and Design - 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chelsea College of Art and Design (South Block)]]

The school acquired premises at [[Great Titchfield Street]], and was jointly accommodated with [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Quintin Hogg]]'s [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]] in [[Regent Street]] (a forerunner of the [[University of Westminster]]). The campus at Manresa Road introduced painting and [[graphic design]] in 1963, with both disciplines being particularly successful. During this period, Chelsea had the highest enrolment of fine art students in any school of its kind in the country, producing many notable artists such as [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]].

[[Lawrence Gowing]], painter and [[art historian]], was appointed as the first headmaster of the Chelsea School of Art. He was responsible for the integration of history and theory with practice, employing artists rather than art historians to teach art history and theory. This approach remains intrinsic to Chelsea's teaching philosophy today.

Under Gowing, an option programme was introduced, which encompassed workshops in experimental music, poetry, [[psychoanalysis]], philosophy and [[anthropology]]. A basic design course, pioneered by [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], was also developed during the same period, becoming the basis of the college's current [[foundation degree|foundation course]] in art and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea College of Arts, University of the Arts London|url=http://www.hotcourses.com/course-provider/chelsea-college-of-art-and-design-university-of-the-arts-london/66536/|publisher=www.hotcourses.com|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042517/http://www.hotcourses.com/course-provider/chelsea-college-of-art-and-design-university-of-the-arts-london/66536/|archive-date=21 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor William Callaway, Head of School from 1989 to 1992. Colin Cina, appointed Dean of School of Art, and Bridget Jackson, Dean of School of Design. These three reformed the school and ensured the redevelopment of the entire academic program, introducing courses at multiple levels from [[Higher National Diploma|HND]] to accredited Honours and Postgraduate degrees. Initially, these were validated by the UK Council for National Academic Awards; i.e. in the short period prior to the London Institute gaining degree-awarding powers. Bridget Jackson was appointed Head of College in 1993, retiring in 1997 to be succeeded by Professor Colin Cina who led the college until his retirement in 2003.

===London Institute===
The Chelsea School of Art became a constituent College of the '''[[London Institute]]''' in 1986, formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to associate London's art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure. The school was renamed '''Chelsea College of Art and Design''' in 1989. The London Institute was granted University status and was renamed [[University of the Arts London]] in 2004. In 2013, the College was renamed Chelsea College of Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/chelsea/ |title=Chelsea College of Arts – University of the Arts London |publisher=Arts.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002–2003, Professor Roger Wilson was appointed as the Head of College until his retirement in 2006. He led the relocation to the [[listed building|listed]] [[Royal Army Medical College]], renovated as a purpose-built art college by the architects [[Allies and Morrison]] in 2005. With this move, the Chelsea College of Arts presently resides next to [[Tate Britain]] at [[Millbank]], returning to one standalone campus.&lt;ref name="History (Official)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelsea.arts.ac.uk/history.htm |title=History (Official) |work=Chelsea.arts.ac.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803230056/http://www.chelsea.arts.ac.uk/history.htm |archivedate=3 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History (AIM25)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=6043&amp;inst_id=55&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2=basic |title=History (AIM25) |work=Aim25.ac.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The college comprises three notable on-site exhibition spaces:

#Chelsea Space is an international and interdisciplinary platform for professional practitioners to exhibit experimental curatorial projects. The gallery also releases regular publications from participating [[authors]], artists and designers.
#The Parade Ground, situated within the college, has been transformed into London's largest open-air gallery hosting events from film screenings to large scale installations in spring 2008. The exhibition ground had previously been used for students and professionals as an open area platform, notably artist [[Chris Burden]]'s 'A Flying Steamroller' in 2006. Recent exhibitions include [[Cildo Meireles]]'s 'Occasion', held in association with his exhibition at [[Tate Modern]] in 2008.
#The Triangle Gallery, pertaining to its name, has been designed as a modern angular shaped space for students to show their work throughout the year.

==Research==
The college organises its research activities in partnership with [[Camberwell College of Arts]] and [[Wimbledon College of Art]] hosts a variety of research centres, groups and clusters:
# International Centre for Fine Art Research (ICFAR)
# Transnational Art, Identity and Nation (TrAIN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The University of the Arts London Research Centre for Transnational Art|url=http://www.transnational.org.uk/|publisher=www.transnational.org.uk|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crisis''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[punk rock]] band formed in 1977 in [[Guildford]] in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name="louder than war"&gt;http://louderthanwar.com/crisis-interviewed-2017-new-line-up-legendary-punk-band-back/&lt;/ref&gt; They performed at rallies for [[Rock Against Racism]] and the [[Anti-Nazi League]], and at Right to Work marches. British music magazine ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' used the phrase "Music to March To" to describe their distinctly edgy, controversial and [[far left politics|far-left]] form of punk rock.&lt;ref name="occ con"&gt;{{cite web|title=The March Of Man's True Destiny|url=http://www.occidentalcongress.com/interviews/intdoug_06.htm|work=Occidental Congress|publisher=Occidental Congress|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Brian M. Clark|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation and career===
Crisis formed in 1977 with the lineup of Phrazer (vocals), Lester Jones (lead guitar), [[Douglas Pearce]] (guitar), [[Tony Wakeford]] (bass) and Insect Robin the Cleaner (drums).

Their debut single, "No Town Hall", was released in 1978 on Action Group Records.

On 11 January 1978, Crisis recorded four tracks at a [[John Peel|Peel Session]] for [[BBC Radio 1]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1970s/1978/&lt;/ref&gt; with two of the tracks released as the "UK 79" 7" single in 1979 on the Ardkor label. The remaining two Peel Session songs were posthumously issued by Ardkor in 1981 as "Alienation".

In early 1979, the band underwent a major change in personnel when Phrazer and Insect Robin the Cleaner were replaced by Dexter (a longtime fan and roadie) and Luke Rendle. After performing their last show, supporting [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] in their hometown of Guildford on 10 May 1980, the band broke up.&lt;ref name="occ con" /&gt; A recording of the final show was released in 2008 as the ''Ends!'' CD.

===Later projects===
Pearce and Wakeford went on to form [[Death in June]] in 1981. Wakeford later joined The Runners from 84, [[Above the Ruins]] and [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]]. Rendle joined [[the Straps]], then The Pack/[[Theatre of Hate]]. Jones formed [[Carcrash International]].&lt;ref name="occ con" /&gt; In 1985, Jones also performed as a touring member of [[Sex Gang Children|Andi Sex Gang &amp; the Quick Gas Gang]].

===Legacy===
The Crisis discography has been compiled on CD twice (as ''We Are All Jews and Germans'' double CD in 1997 by [[World Serpent Distribution|World Serpent]], and as ''Holocaust Hymns'' single CD in 2005 by Apop Records),&lt;ref name="occ con" /&gt; as well as once on vinyl LP ''Kollectiv'' in 2014 by La Vida Es un Mus).

===Reformation===
In 2015, Wakeford formed the ensemble 1.9.8.4.,&lt;ref&gt;http://industrialart.eu/en/artists/1984-ex-crisis-uk&lt;/ref&gt; to perform the songs he had written for both Crisis and Death in June. In 2017, 1.9.8.4., was renamed Crisis,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fearandloathingfanzine.com/crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;, announcing concerts in the UK and Europe in 2017 and 2018. The new Crisis line-up consists of original member Wakeford on bass, Lloyd James (of [[Naevus (band)|Naevus]]) on vocals, Clive Giblin (of [[Alternative TV]]) on guitar and Igor Olejar (of Autorotation) on drums.&lt;ref name="louder than war"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pg/one98four/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2017 interview with ''[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]'', Wakeford said, "It became increasingly obvious that there was major interest in Crisis and that the band and songs held a special place in people hearts...There is obviously a growing interest in that period, with a lot of bands reforming. Crisis were an important part of that history, and I think the band sound fresh and the songs are still valid, perhaps even more so today".&lt;ref name="louder than war"/&gt; In mid-2018, Aurora Lee replaced Olejar on drums.

'''''Danseuse au café''''' (also known as '''''Dancer in a Café''''' or '''''Au Café Concert''''' and '''''Danseuse''''') is a large oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). The work was exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912, entitled ''Danseuse''. The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created a controversy in the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des Députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such 'barbaric' art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick F. Barrer: ''Quand l'art du XXe siècle était conçu par les inconnus'', pp. 93-101, gives an account of the debate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no.

The painting is now located at the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albrightknox.org/collection/search/piece:441/ Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York, Jean Metzinger, ''Danseuse au café'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Danseuse au café'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 146.1 x 114.3&amp;nbsp;cm (57.5 x 45 in). As the title indicates the painting represents a woman dancing in a café. She is shown on the right half of the canvas wearing an elaborate gown and holding in her right hand a bouquet of flowers. In the café scene, four others, two women and two men, can be observed on the left of the painting, three of whom are seated in front of a table upon which various items are placed (including beverages), and one of whom is placed seemingly in the background (upper left).

: Metzinger's "enchanting" ''Dancer in a Café'', writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "exults in the exoticism of the moment, playing off the feathers or plumes of fashionable dressed Parisian women in their Worth gowns against an Amerindian pattern on the costume of the dancer, wittily comparing the height of European fashion with the anthropologically arcane."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: ''At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, exhibition catalogue: ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other works by Metzinger of the same period, there are elements to be found of the real world, e.g., lighting fixtures, flowers, feathers and lace. The rest of the canvas consists of a series of crescendos and diminuendos of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave forms, of hyperbolic and spherical surfaces, that stem from the teachings of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Cézanne]]. The [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in his Neo-Impressionst phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century, [[Louis Vauxcelles]], 1907, describes the brushwork of Delaunay and Metzinger as mosaic-like 'cubes']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dancer in a café'' depicts strikingly fashionable women and men at the height of Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a ''directoire-style'' beaded and embroidered green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This can be seen in the deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of [[chiaroscuro]], of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm0CrcbXtN&amp;sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=horse&amp;f=false David Cottington, 2004, Cubism and its Histories], Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

"The style of the clothes is meticulously up-to-the-minute" writes Cottington of Metzinger's three entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, "the cut of the dresses, and the relatively uncorseted silhouettes they permitted their weavers to display, owe much more to Poiret than to Worth—indeed the check of one figure in the ''Dancer'' and the polka dots of the ''[[Femme à l'Éventail|Woman with a Fan]]'' anticipate the post-war geometries, if not the colour harmonies, of [[Sonia Delaunay]]'s fabrics, while the open-collared sportiness of the dress and cloche-style hat in ''The Yellow Feather'' look forward to the 1920s."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

==Paul Poiret, Isadora Duncan and the art world==
[[Image:Poiretdress.jpg|thumb|Dress designed by [[Paul Poiret]], ca. 1912, Poiret model - Gimbels&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b32052/ Poiret model - Gimbels, Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The French fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]] actually worked for the [[House of Worth]] early in the 20th century, however, the "brazen modernity of his designs" proved too much for Worth's conservative clientele. Poiret established his own house in 1903 and threw spectacular parties to promote his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hamish Bowles]], ''Fashioning the Century'', ''Vogue'' (May 2007): 236–250. A [http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/050107/page2.html condensed version of this article] appears online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1911 Poiret unveiled “Parfums de Rosine" in a grand soirée held at his palatial home (a ''hôtel particulier'' avenue d'Antin), a costume ball christened ''“la mille et deuxième nuit,”'' (the thousand and second night), attended by the Parisian high-society and the artistic world. [[Raoul Dufy]]—with whom Metzinger had exhibited at the gallery of [[Berthe Weill]] in 1903, the Indépendants of 1905 and Galerie Notre-Dame-des-Champs in 1908—designed the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_0hjfgkDv1wC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22mille+et+deuxième+nuit%22+Poiret&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=59dZO8Lbdz&amp;sig=BkT5i10cmUJ4oBP_q_gjbFe-cEw&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mille%20et%20deuxième%20nuit%22%20Poiret&amp;f=false Dominique Paulvé, Marion Chesnais, ''Les Mille et Une Nuits et les enchantements du docteur Mardrus'' Edition Norma, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Gardens were illuminated by lanterns and live tropical birds. His marketing strategy became a sensation and the talk of Paris. A second scent debuted in 1912, "Le Minaret," again emphasizing the harem theme.&lt;ref&gt;Tilar J. Mazzeo, ''The Secret of Chanel No. 5'', HarperCollins, 2010, pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the photographer [[Edward Steichen]] was challenged by publisher [[:fr:Lucien Vogel|Lucien Vogel]] to promote fashion as a fine art by the use of photography.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Niven, 1997, ''Steichen: A Biography'', New York: Clarkson Potter, {{ISBN|0-517-59373-4}}, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs of Poiret's gowns, published in the April 1911 issue of the magazine ''Art et Décoration'', are now considered to be the first modern fashion photography shoot.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Alexander, ''Edward Steichen: Lives in Photography,'' HotShoe magazine, no.151, December/January 2008, pp.66 – 67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Vogel began his renowned fashion journal [[La Gazette du Bon Ton]], showcasing Poiret's designs, along with other leading Paris designers such as the House of [[Charles Worth]], [[Louise Chéruit]], [[Georges Doeuillet]], [[Jeanne Paquin]], [[Redfern (couture)|Redfern &amp; Sons]] and [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (the [[Post-Impressionist]] and [[Cubist]] art collector who purchased ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', directly from Picasso's studio).

Paul Poiret had a lifelong interest in modern art for the purposes of self-promotion and the benefit of his diverse commercial enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/20168287/Couture-Culture Nancy J. Troy, ''Couture Culture: A Study in Modern Art and Fashion'', Cambridge, Mass., MIT Press, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he rented and restored a mansion built by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] for [[Louis XV]], 1750, called [[Pavillon du Butard]] in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]] (not far from Albert Gleizes' studio and close to the Duchamp residence, where the [[Section d'Or]] group gathered) and threw lavish parties, including one of the more famous ''grandes fêtes'' dated 20 June 1912, ''La fête de Bacchus'' (re-creating the [[Bacchanalia]] hosted by [[Louis XIV]] at Versailles). Guy-Pierre Fauconnet (1882-1920) designed the invitation. [[Isadora Duncan]], wearing a Hellenic evening gown designed by Poiret,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1625930,00.html Rachel Aydt, ''Rediscovered'', Life in Paris during the Belle Epoque... Time Magazine, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; danced on tables among 300 guests and 900 bottles of champagne were consumed until the first light of day.

In the company of her friend Marie Laurencin, Nicole Poiret frequented the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] world of [[Montmartre]], [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and the Cubists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cvlDG-VB7lIC&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=%22nicole+groult%22&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Benoîte Groult, ''Mon évasion'', Éditions Grasset &amp; Fasquelle, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle|Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]] had met Isadora in 1903 at [[Auguste Rodin]]'s picnic, and in 1909 he saw her dance on stage. The 'nymph' who had been persuaded to take off her skirt and dance on the grass in her muslin petticoat had become a beautiful muse. Bourdelle had previously been asked to decorate the facade of the planned [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]]. When he saw her he realized that Isadora was his muse: "To me it seemed that there, through her, was animated an ineffable frieze wherein divine frescoes slowly became human realities. Each leap, each attitude of the great artist remains in my memory like flashes of lightning." Bourdelle would return from the theatre and sketch for hours. His images of Isadora are the most varied, for they convey not only Isadora but the vast range of emotions she embodied.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;[http://www.meaus.com/isadora-duncan.htm John Zavrel, ''Isadora Duncan and 'The Dance''', West-Art, Prometheus, Internet Bulletin for Art, Politics and Science, Nr. 86, Spring 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 Isadora had become an icon for artists in Paris. Many had first seen her in 1903 when she had gone to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and distributed complimentary tickets to students. The artist Dunoyer de Segonzac published his first Isadora portfolio in 1910, with a preface in verse by the poet Fernand Divoire.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; At this time, Dunoyer de Segonzac and Metzinger were both teachers at the [[Académie de La Palette]], 104 Bd de Clichy, Paris 18ème, along with [[Henri Le Fauconnier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3493?tmpl=component&amp;print=1 Collection Online, Liubov Popova, Birsk, 1916, Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger's interest in fashion was mirrored by Poiret's interest in modern art. On 18 November 1925 works from the art collection of Paul Poiret were exhibited and sold at a public auction in Paris. Artists in his collection included Derain, van Dongen, Dufresne, Dufy, de La Fresnaye, Othon Friesz, Matisse, Modigliani (''Portrait de Max Jacob''), Picabia, Picasso, Rouault and Dunoyer de Segonzac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.diktats.com/catalog/product/view/id/229/category/53/# |title=Catalogue des Tableaux Modernes... de la Collection de M.

Though it is unclear whether Metzinger attended these parties it would be very unlikely that he and a selected few of his fellow Cubists did not—considering the celebrity status he enjoyed at the forefront of the avant-garde. Three months after ''La fête de Bacchus'' Metzinger exhibited ''Dancer in a café'' at the Salon d'Automne, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November 1912.

==Multiple perspective==
Despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting—the reflexive function of complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types—there does manifest itself in ''Danseuse'' a certain spatial depth or perspective reminiscent of the optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too the man at the upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground. It shows that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not imply the absolute destruction of classical perspective, or that simply, the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of others, Metzinger had no intention of abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] and [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the [[Return to order]] phase).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 52, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|Mánes]] in Prague, 1914, acquired in 1916 by [[Georg Muche]] at the Galerie [[Der Sturm]], confiscated by the Nazis circa 1936, displayed at the [[Degenerate Art]] show in Munich, and missing ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emuseum.campus.fu-berlin.de/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultListView/result.t1.collection_list.$TspTitleLink.link&amp;sp=10&amp;sp=Scollection&amp;sp=SfieldValue&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=SdetailList&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=F&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=0 Degenerate Art Database (Beschlagnahme Inventar, Entartete Kunst)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are, however, objective factors that prevent the illusion from succeeding completely: (1) the canvas is two-dimensional while reality is three-dimensional, (2) the uniqueness of the view-point (humans have two eyes). Metzinger compensates for the missing spatiality in his two-dimensional representation by giving other cues for depth, in addition to relative size: shading and shadows, source of light, occlusion (e.g., the stage or table upon which the woman dances cuts 'in front' of the woman sitting at the table). Metzinger represents a subjective effect objectively on the canvas, imitating subjective phenomena (of vision) objectively. [[Henri Poincaré]], in ''Science and Hypothesis'', 1902, discusses 'representative' space (visual, tactile and motor space) versus 'geometrical' space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/aar/862/accueil.asp?id=862 Helmholtz on Space and Painting, Michael Heidelberger, University of Tübingen]. Translation from Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) lectures, 1871-1873 on ''Optisches über Malerei'' (''On the Relation of Optics to Painting''), publ. 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting inscribes an ambivalence in that it expresses both contemporary and classical, modern and traditional, avant-garde and academic connotations, simultaneously. The "busy geometry of planar fragmentation and juxtaposed perspectives has a more than reflexive function," notes Cottington, "for the symmetrical patterning of its reticulations (as in the dancer's ''décolletage'') and their rhythmic parallel repetitions suggest not only movement and diagrams but also, metonymically, the mechanised object-world of modernity."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

Two works entitled ''Nu'' and ''Landscape'', circa 1908 and 1909 respectively, indicate that Metzinger had already departed from his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] brand of [[Divisionism]] by 1908. Turning his attention fully towards the [[geometric abstraction]] of form, Metzinger allowed the viewer to reconstruct the original volume mentally and to imagine the object depicted within space. But this wasn't the space of [[Euclidean geometry]] and its associated classical one-point perspective in use and unquestioned since the onset of the Renaissance. This was an all-out multi-frontal attack on the narrow limitations of academicism, on pre-20th century empiricism, on [[positivism]], [[determinism]] and the untenable notions of [[absolute space]], [[absolute time]] and absolute truth. It was a revolt inline with those leveled by the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] and the philosophers [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Henri Bergson]]. This was an embrace of [[Riemannian geometry]], of the relativity of knowledge, of realities hidden by human vision, an embrace of the world that surpassed material appearances. Poincaré, in ''Science &amp; Method, The Relativity of Space'' (1897), wrote: "Absolute space exists no longer; there is only space relative to a certain initial position of the body."&lt;ref name="Henri Poincaré 1897"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/poincare.htm Henri Poincaré, 1897, Science &amp; Method, The Relativity of Space]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the characteristic property of space, that of having three dimensions, is only a property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to speak, in the human intelligence. The destruction of some of these connections that is to say of these associations of ideas, would be sufficient to give us a different distribution board, and that might be enough to endow space with a fourth dimension. [...] It quite seems, indeed, that it would be possible to translate our physics into the language of geometry of four dimensions. (Henri Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name="Henri Poincaré 1897" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Albert Gleizes, writing on Metzinger's Cubism in September 1911 (almost a year before the completion of ''Danseuse au café''), identified Metzinger as a follower of Nietzsche who 'invents his own truth' by destroying 'old values'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

His concerns for color that had assumed a primary role both as a decorative and expressive device before 1908 had given way to the primacy of form. But his monochromatic tonalities would last only until 1912, when both color and form would boldly combine to produce such works as ''Danseuse au café''. "The works of Jean Metzinger" [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] writes in 1912 "have purity. His meditations take on beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach sublimity. The new structures he is composing are stripped of everything that was known before him."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;pg=PA88-IA9&amp;dq=%22femme+au+cheval%22+%22jean+metzinger%22&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22femme%20au%20cheval%22%20%22jean%20metzinger%22&amp;f=false Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, ''The Cubist Painters'', translated, with commentary by Peter F. Read, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a resident of la Butte [[Montmartre]] in Paris, Metzinger entered the circle of Picasso and Braque (in 1908). "It is to the credit of Jean Metzinger, at the time, to have been the first to recognize the commencement of the Cubist Movement as such" writes S. E. Johnson, "Metzinger's portrait of Apollinaire, the poet of the Cubist Movement, was executed in 1909 and, as Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (written in 1912 and published in 1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S.

==Simultaneity and multiplicity==

With the overthrow of classical perspective and its implicit staticity quasi-complete, the new concept of ''mobile perspective'', first propounded by Metzinger in his 1910 publication ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; implied explicitly the dynamism of motion within multiple-spatial dimensions. In the article Metzinger notes the similarities between [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], stressing the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, with Metzinger flanked between, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

Apollinaire, possibly with the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in mind, wrote a year later of this "state of motion" as akin to "cinematic" movement around an object, revealing a "plastic truth" compatible with reality by showing the spectator "all its facets."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes again in 1911 remarks Metzinger is "haunted by the desire to inscribe a total image":

:He will put down the greatest number of possible planes: to purely objective truth he wishes to add a new truth, born from what his intelligence permits him to know. Thus—and he said himself: to space he will join time. [...] he wishes to develop the visual field by multiplying it, to inscribe them all in the space of the same canvas: it is then that the cube will play a role, for Metzinger will utilize this means to reestablish the equilibrium that these audacious inscriptions will have momentarily broken. (Gleizes)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the artist became free to explore notions of ''simultaneity'', whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single painting.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

This picture plane, write Metzinger and Gleizes (in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', 1912), "reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces." The forms situated within this space, they continue, "spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility."&lt;ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes"&gt;Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Paris, 1912, in Robert L. Herbert, ''Modern Artists on Art'', Englewood Cliffs, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, (1) "all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention", giving the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed (or towards which they tend), creating spaces of maximum or minimum intensity. (2) "The spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard to the images which they produce in the mind." (Metzinger and Gleizes, 1912)&lt;ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the founders of Cubist theory, objects possess no absolute or essential form. "There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it."&lt;ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes" /&gt;

==Theoretical underpinnings==
The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (1912). It was also a central idea of Jean Metzinger's ''Note sur la Peinture'', 1910; Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. And it was Metzinger for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' who enunciated the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. It was then that Metzinger discarded traditional perspective and granted himself the liberty of moving around objects. This is the concept of "mobile perspective" that would tend towards the representation of the "total image."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Though at first the idea would shock the general public some eventually came to accept it, as they came to accept the '[[atomist]]' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors within the context of Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of 'mobile perspective' is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in [[Paul Signac]]'s ''D'Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionisme'', with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form within the context of both space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in Les Annales politiques et littéraires, n. 1529, 13 October 1912]]
The Salon d'Automne of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November, saw the Cubists (listed below) regrouped into the same room XI. For the occasion, ''Danseuse au café'' was reproduced in a photograph published in an article entitled ''Au Salon d'Automne "Les Indépendants"'' in the French newspaper ''Excelsior'', 2 Octobre 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne 1912, page from ''Excelsior'' reproduced]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Excelsior (journal)|Excelsior]] was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such ''L'Excelsior'' was a pioneer of [[photojournalism]].

The history of the Salon d'Automne is marked by two important dates: 1905, bore witness to the birth of [[Fauvism]] (with the participation of Metzinger), and 1912, the xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel. The 1912 polemic leveled against both the French and non-French avant-garde artists originated in ''Salle XI'' where the Cubists exhibited their works. The resistance to foreigners (dubbed "apaches") and avant-garde artists was just the visible face of a more profound crises: that of defining modern French art, and the dwindling of an artistic system crystallized around the heritage of [[Impressionism]] centered in Paris. Burgeoning was a new avant-garde system, the international logic of which—''mercantile'' and ''médiatique''—put into question the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of ''aesthetics'' quickly turned ''political'', and as in the 1905 Salon d'Automne, with his infamous "Donatello chez les fauves",&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905. Screen 5 and 6. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France], {{ISSN|1149-9397}}&lt;/ref&gt; the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] (Les Arts, 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. Recall too, it was Vauxcelles who, on the occasion of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, wrote disparagingly of 'pallid cubes' with reference to the paintings of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the [[Grand Palais]], to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician [[Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué]] made the front page of ''Le Journal'', 5 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7625001c/f1.image "M.

* [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited ''La Femme en Bleu'' (''Woman in Blue''), 1912 (Kunstmuseum, Basel) and ''Le passage à niveau'' (''The Level Crossing''), 1912 (Fondation Beyeler, Riehen, Switzerland)
* [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], ''Les Baigneuse'' (''The bathers'') 1912 (The National Gallery, Washington) and ''Les joueurs de cartes'' (Card Players)
* [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''The Huntsman'' (Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, Netherlands) and ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours'' (''Mountaineers Attacked by Bears''), 1912 (Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design).
* [[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|l'Homme au Balcon (Man on a Balcony), (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), also exhibited at the [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913.
* [[André Lhote]], ''Le jugement de Paris'', 1912 (Private collection)

* [[Joseph Csaky]] exhibited the sculptures ''[[Groupe de femmes]]'', 1911-1912 (location unknown), ''Portrait de M.S.H.'', no. 91 (location unknown), and ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse (Femme à l'éventail, Femme à la cruche)]]'', no. 405  (location unknown)

This exhibition also featured ''La Maison cubiste''. [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] designed facade of a 10 meter by 3 meter house, which included a hall, a living room and a bedroom. This installation was placed in the Art Décoratif section of the Salon d'Automne. The major contributors were [[André Mare]], a decorative designer, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]. In the house were hung cubist paintings by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger (''Woman with a Fan'', 1912).

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] commended Metzinger's 'finesse and distinction of palette'. Maurice Raynal noted the seductive charm and sureness of execution of Metzinger's entries, the refined sensibility of Metzinger himself, the playfulness and grace of whom he compares to [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], while singling out Metzinger as 'certainly ... the man of our time who knows best how to paint'.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

In a review of the exhibition published in ''Le Petit Parisien'', art critic Jean Claude writes of entries by Léger, Gleizes and Metzinger: "Mr. Léger walked his brush on the canvas after having dipped them in blue, black, red and brown. It is stupefying to look at. The catalog says it's a Woman in blue. Poor woman. Man on a Balcony, by Mr. Gleizes, is more comprehensible. At least in the chaos of cubes and trapezoids we find a man. I will say as much for the entry of Mr. Metzinger, Dancers. It has the effect of a puzzle that is not assembled properly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k564474q/f2.image Jean Claude, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Le Petit Parisien, 30 September 1912, p. 2].

'''Edge of Arabia''' is an independent arts initiative developing the appreciation of contemporary Arab art and culture with a particular focus on [[Saudi Arabia]]. As a social enterprise ''Edge of Arabia'' is committed to reaching new audiences and improving understanding through touring, non-commercial &amp; free exhibitions, through publications, and through education programs targeting schools &amp; universities.

==History==
The initiative was born from a chance encounter in 2003 between British artist, [[Stephen Stapleton]], and Saudi artists, [[Ahmed Mater]] and [[Abdulnasser Gharem]],&lt;ref&gt;Greenbox Museum of Contemporary Art from Saudi Arabia, [http://greenboxmuseum.com/sa-abdulnassergharem.html Abdulnasser Gharem]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Al Meftaha Arts Village in [[Abha]], Saudi Arabia. In January 2013 it opened a permanent space including a gallery and library in [[Battersea]], London, before moving to central London in 2016.

==World Tour==
''Edge of Arabia'' officially launched with a major exhibition showcasing 17 artists from Saudi Arabia at London's [[Brunei Gallery]] in October 2008. In just over two months the organizers saw more than 13,000 visitors, breaking the record for attendance at the [[University of London]]'s largest gallery.

In June 2009, ''Edge of Arabia'' travelled to the 53rd [[Venice Biennale]] to the Palazzo Contarini Polignac featuring the work of eight Saudi contemporary artists, and continued its world tour with an exhibition entitled ''Grey Borders/Grey Frontiers'' in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Tagesspiegel]], 29 June 2010, [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/soho-house-edge-of-arabia-zeigt-kunst-aus-saudi-arabien/1871386.html Edge of Arabia zeigt Kunst aus Saudi Arabien]&lt;/ref&gt; its ''TRANSiTION'' exhibition in [[Istanbul]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ikono.tv]], 19 October 2010, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJKZCHCW8s Edge of Arabia in Istanbul]&lt;/ref&gt; both in 2010, and ''TERMINAL'' coinciding with [[Art Dubai]] in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], 9 March 2011, [http://www.timeoutdubai.com/art/features/21699-edge-of-arabia Pioneering art scheme brings Saudi Arabia's contemporary art to the masses]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a collateral Venice Biennale event in 2011, the grassroots initiative further broadened its outreach to produce the first pan-Arab exhibition of contemporary art as part of the 54th [[Venice Biennale|Venice Art Biennale]]: ''The Future of A Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]], 3 June 2011, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2ed8469c-8d56-11e0-bf23-00144feab49a.html A spring in their step]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlin Art Link, 5 November 2011, [http://vimeo.com/31649658 "The Future of a Promise" at the 54th Venice Biennale]&lt;/ref&gt;

With its first public show inside the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[The Huffington Post]], 25 January 2012, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/saudi-artists-we-need-to-talk_n_1230477.html 'We Need To Talk': Saudi Arabia's First Public Contemporary Art Exhibit Tests Governmental Limits]&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2012 ''Edge of Arabia'' celebrated its home-coming in an unfinished shopping mall at the Al Furusia Marina with an exhibition entitled ''Edge of Arabia [[Jeddah]]: We Need To Talk''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], 18 January 2012, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/world/middleeast/contemporary-artists-rock-the-boat-gently-in-saudi-arabia.html?ref=middleeast Contemporary Artists Rock the Boat Gently in Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]], 23 January 2012, [http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/saudi-artists-find-a-voice-in-edge-of-arabias-jeddah-exhibition Saudi artists find a voice in Edge of Arabia's Jeddah exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; To continue engaging local school and university students in contemporary art from across the region, ''Edge of Arabia'''s accompanying art education programme included an art symposium, a dedicated education room with workshop, presentation and research facilities for visitors, guided tours of the exhibition, and practical workshops with participating artists.

On 6 October 2012, ''Edge of Arabia'' opened its most ambitious exhibition to date, showcasing large-scale, multi-media work by over 30 leading Arab and Islamic World artists in the heart of creative [[East London]] titled [http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/cometogether-london #COMETOGETHER]. During its three-week duration, the exhibition together with its side programme of educational events including workshops, talks and film screenings attracted over 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]], 19 October 2012, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e7318a5c-16ce-11e2-b1df-00144feabdc0.html An exhibition of the lesser known side of Middle East art comes to London’s East End]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enterprise forms automation''' is a company-wide computer system or set of systems for managing, distributing, [[Document processing|completing and processing]] paper-based forms, applications, surveys, contracts and other documents. It plays a vital role towards achieving the goal of a [[paperless office]].

The term "enterprise forms automation" was first used in the mid 1990s by [[JetForm]] Corporation to describe their solution to automating paperwork. This process was later acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] and is now part of the [[Adobe LiveCycle]] suite of products. In 2004 Efficient Technology Inc became the first company to apply this term in the [[software as a service]]. 

This term is intended to refer to the automation of paper-based processes that specifically rely on documents (forms, applications, etc.) that retain their paper-based look and feel even if not printed out during the process. In order for a forms automation solution to be considered an ‘Enterprise Forms Automation’ solution it must meet the requirements of [[enterprise software]] and be specifically focused on automating paperwork and paper-based forms.

==Impact==
Organizations implement enterprise software solutions in order to automate major functions and large processes as these areas offer the greatest cost savings and return on investment compared to smaller projects. Enterprise-level implementations often cost well over $100,000 and therefore take many months to realize cost savings. As such, automating smaller functions are ignored due to the lack of immediate financial benefit or cost savings. As functions become more and more automated while software costs for enterprise systems drop in price, organizations begin automating lower-level functions in order to reap additional cost savings and become more efficient. In addition, through the advent of standards like Adobe’s PDF model and service models like Quik!, automating the process of filling out forms is one such area that companies seek to automate via Enterprise Forms Automation solutions. 

Automating forms also has a positive ‘green’ impact on the environment. In order to reduce waste and carbon emissions, companies seek ways to eliminate paper. By deploying an Enterprise Forms Automation system, companies can eliminate paper entirely or significantly reduce how much paper is used, while greatly reducing shipping and handling costs, storage costs, and printing costs associated to pre-printed forms. In addition, automating paper-based processes greatly speeds up the time it takes to perform transactions, which results in fewer errors, rejections and revisions and has the benefit of freeing up the time spent by users on manual labor.

== Implementation ==
=== DMS ===
In today’s implementation of the paperless office concept there are two main focuses: creating documents and managing documents. Since major systems have already displaced paper altogether (e.g. [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], [[accounting software]], etc.), the paper that continues to be in use is largely generated by processes that capture data, generate reports and distribute communications. As software and computers have evolved, the first problem to be addressed has been the management of existing and legacy documents through [[document management system]]s. 

Document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms. Typically, the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned and/or sent into the system. Many document management systems include the ability to read documents via [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and use that data within the document management system’s framework. While this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard D. Walker |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place.

The ultimate step towards eliminating paper is to change the way that documents are created. In 1993 Adobe Systems introduced the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) in order to facilitate the exchange of documents in a universal manner across most computer platforms. This format has laid the foundation for creating, transporting, working on and archiving electronic documents and in 2008 became an ISO standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = ISO 32000-1:2008  | publisher = International Organization For Standardization  | date = July 1, 2008  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=51502}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the PDF model established a method for automating forms that allows forms to be prefilled with existing data and manually entered on a PC screen which can greatly reduce and/or eliminate the number of paper forms being printed.

=== Implementation tools ===
A typical Enterprise Forms Automation implementation typically combines the following technologies:
* Library of electronic versions of paper-based documents (PDF format or other comparable format)
* Data store of existing data and/or web page to collect data to fill onto forms
* Software to pre-fill existing data from databases and data stores onto electronic forms
* Software to save forms that are in process and/or partially completed
* Software to capture and translate electronic form data
* Workflow systems to manage the interaction with forms and data
* Two-way messaging between forms and systems during submission and validation
* Barcode software to match images of forms with electronic form data
* Digital signature solutions to capture signatures electronically

=== Implementation challenges ===
The primary challenge to making use of these technologies is a matter of resource planning and implementation costs, however all of the necessary technologies have been in existence since at least 2000. Furthermore, the [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act]] (ESIGN Act) was signed into legislation by Congress requiring that digital signatures be accepted as valid signatures. But even with the law in effect, companies have been slow to adopt such solutions due to the cost and skills required to design, build and maintain such systems at a reasonable price.

A secondary challenge is integrating the electronic forms into an existing process, whereby existing data stores can be accessed and supplied to and from the forms. While tools to assist with the integration exist, most implementations require custom programming efforts to the specific forms and data sources.

Many of these challenges are being addressed by middleware solutions, technology platforms and services that tie all the pieces together. Known as [[Enterprise Application Integration]] (“EAI”), developers of EAI solutions are continually introducing new cost-effective methods to take advantage of web-based and centrally-managed capabilities plus the ability to leverage legacy system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Fine Prints of the Year''''' was an annual series of books that reported and discussed the [[etching]]s, [[engraving]]s, [[woodcut]]s and [[lithograph]]s published each year between 1923 and 1938 by major artists of the period. All volumes reproduced in [[monochrome]] on high quality glossy paper a selection of about 100 [[special edition|limited edition]] prints published during the preceding year. The series provides an important record of the work of artists in the last years of the [[etching revival]] and during the collapse of the market for prints.

==History==
The first volume of ''Fine Prints of the Year'' was published in London in 1924 by Halton and Truscott Smith as a review of the prints issued during the year up to October, 1923.&lt;ref name=FPOY1&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1924). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1923.  An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 1. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited&lt;/ref&gt;  The volume reproduced 150 etchings, drypoints, lithographs or woodcuts by major British and American printmakers of the day such as [[Stanley Anderson]], [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank Benson]], [[Edmund Blampied]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Gerald Brockhurst]], [[F.L. Griggs]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[James McBey]], [[Henry Rushbury]], [[Frank Short]] and [[William Walcot]] as well as the work of many artists whose work is less well known.&lt;ref name=FPOY1/&gt;  Some copies of volume two, for the year 1924, contained as a frontispiece an unsigned, original etching by Frank Brangwyn.&lt;ref name=FPOY2&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1925). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1924. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 2. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited&lt;/ref&gt; From the third volume ''Fine Prints of the Year'' was also published in the USA by Minton, Balch and Company of New York.&lt;ref name=FPOY3&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1926). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1925. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 3. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 13 volumes, from 1923 to 1935, contained an introductory essay by [[Malcolm Charles Salaman|Malcolm Salaman]], an art critic and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, now the [[Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers]]. From 1936 to 1938 the introduction was provided by [[Campbell Dodgson]], who was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the [[British Museum]]. From 1926 to 1930 each volume contained a short introduction to American prints by Helen Fagg; from 1931 to 1934 the introduction was written by Susan A. Hutchinson.

From the second volume, published in 1924, the series also published a directory of the publishers of prints and a directory of the name and address of the etchers, engravers and lithographers then working in Great Britain, France, the United States of America and elsewhere with the titles, dimensions, publishers and sometimes with the prices of the prints designed or released by each artist during the previous year. This constitutes an important record of the work of many artists which, until the print boom ended in around 1930, were seen as an investment and were the subject of substantial trading and inflated prices. For example, an etching entitled ''Mersea, Sunset'' by [[James McBey]], whose work was highly sought after in the 1920s, was issued to subscribers in an edition of 76 [[artist's proof]]s in 1926 at a price of 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name=FPOY3/&gt; A proof of this print from the edition of 76 was sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in December of the same year for just under 105 guineas, a ten times higher price.&lt;ref name=PPC9&gt;Wilder, F.L. &amp; Wilder, E.L. (1928). ''Print Prices Current'', volume 9, October 1926-August 1927. London: F.L. &amp; E.L. Wilder.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wall Street Crash]] in the USA and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] greatly diminished the market for prints, but many artists continued to design plates, though fewer in number, in smaller editions and at lower prices, as the volumes of ''Fine Prints of the Year'' between 1930 and 1938 show. For example, the artist Edmund Blampied issued 76 etchings between 1920 and 1929, typically in editions of 100 proofs, but in the following decade only published 23 etchings, some in editions of less than 50 proofs.&lt;ref name=Hall1&gt;Hall, A. (2010). ''[[Edmund Blampied]]. An illustrated life''.  Pp 272.  Jersey: [[Jersey Heritage]]. {{ISBN|978-0-9562079-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fine Prints of the Year'' continued as a record of the work of etchers and engravers until the sixteenth and last annual volume for 1938,&lt;ref name=FPOY16&gt;Dodgson, C., editor (1938). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1938. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 16. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; just before the start of the [[Second World War]] in Europe brought about rationing of paper and presumably put an end to the series. The 16 volumes published in the series reproduced over 1,700 prints and remains an important visual and factual record of the work of etchers and engravers, many of whom were once well known and whose prints commanded high prices.

'''''Finnmark, Winter''''' (Norwegian: '''''Finnmark, winter''''') is a painting by Norwegian artist [[Anna-Eva Bergman]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063612/NO_280_010.html |title=Finnmark, Winter, Anna-Eva Bergman |website=europeana.eu |language=en |access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was made with metal foil on canvas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondationhartungbergman.fr/sitehhaeb/Anna-Eva-Bergman,36?lang=en|title=Anna-Eva Bergman  - Foundation Hartung Bergman|website=www.fondationhartungbergman.fr|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has dimensions of 150 x 300&amp;nbsp;cm.

The picture is part of the collection of the Fondation Hartung-Bergman in [[Antibes, France]].&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Background==
Although Anna-Eva Bergman was Norwegian, she did most of her work in France, where she participated in numerous exhibitions until her death in 1987. Her principles in art grew from the line drawings she drew for books by herself and others. In her last forty years of production she opted for abstract paintings inspired by nature. Looking for new techniques, she used aluminum, silver and gold foil in her work. 

Beginning in the 1950s, after a visit to the north of Norway, she began to paint its landscapes. 

''Finnmark'' was created with aluminum foil applied to the fabric; a technique that gives a special light to this painting.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents an arctic landscape in [[Finnmark]], Norway near the border with [[Russia]] in [[Murmansk]]. A strong contrast is expressed with light and dark areas in horizontal lines, representing the snow objects in the dark northern winter, the relationship between light and shadow in the landscape, creating a perspective effect that allows the viewer to look beyond the [[tundra]] of Finnmark.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

'''''Fishing for Souls''''' is a 1614 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age]] artist [[Adriaen van de Venne]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/219482 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''Fishing for Souls'' shows an allegory of the jealousy between the various religious denominations during the [[Twelve Years Truce]] between the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The river signifies the split between the Northern and the Southern Netherlands that occurred with the [[Beeldenstorm]]. In the original painting the Protestant fishermen had successfully fished up some believers while the Catholic nets were empty. The "souls" near the Catholic boats were added later. On the left bank are the two princes of Orange behind an orange tree branch; [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice]] and [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]]. They are accompanied by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], [[King James I of England]] and the young [[Louis XIII of France]] with his mother [[Maria de' Medici]]. On the right bank of the river are the Catholic cardinals carrying their pope accompanied by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]]. The various attributes of the fishermen (nets, boats, etc.) are labelled with Latin text to clarify the meaning. A large fly is painted on as a [[trompe l'oeil]] wink to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] who created many similar amusing allegories with visual jokes in them.

==Provenance==
[[File:Gerrit Lamberts - Trippenhuis - Stadsarchief Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|This painting can be seen hanging in a 19th-century sketch of the gallery of the [[Trippenhuis]] before the collection was moved to its present location in 1885]]
This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all ''Highlights of the Rijksmuseum'' catalogs. It was appropriated for the national art collection in September 1798 during the French occupation for the National Kunst Galerie in the Hague, from the collections of [[William V, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem V]]. This appropriation was a tactical move to secure certain works from being abducted by the French to Paris, which had happened with the larger part of [[Prince William V Gallery|Prince Willem's gallery]] in 1795 after the prince fled to England. ''Fishing for Souls'' has remained in the national collection ever since.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-447 Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Chakravarthi''' is a multi-disciplinary artist working with photography, video, painting and performance. His work addresses the politics of identity including race, sexuality and gender, and also religious iconography among other subjects. He was born in India and moved to London, England in 1980.&lt;ref name="About George Chakravarthi" /&gt;

He has exhibited and performed all over the UK and internationally at venues including [[Site Gallery]], Sheffield, England; [[Tate Modern]], London, England; [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, England; [[:de:Künstlerhaus Mousonturm|Künstlerhaus Mousonturm]], Frankfurt, Germany; [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences|Dance Academy (Tilburg)]], Tilburg, Netherlands; Queens Gallery, [[British Council]], New Delhi, India;&lt;ref name="About George Chakravarthi" /&gt; [[La Casa Encendida (Madrid)|La Casa Encendida]], Madrid, Spain;&lt;ref name="El Cultural"/&gt; [[Vienna Künstlerhaus|Brut Künstlerhaus]], Vienna, Austria&lt;ref name="Negrophilia Vienna"/&gt; and [[Abrons Arts Center]], New York City, USA.&lt;ref name="Abrons Arts Center - Just Like A Woman"/&gt;

Chakravarthi has been commissioned by the [[BBC]], [[Artangel]], [[InIVA]], the [[Arts Council of England]], the [[British Council]], the [[Spill Festival|SPILL Festival of Performance]], the [[Live Art Development Agency]], the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].&lt;ref name="Brighton University - George Chakravarthi"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Chakravarthi|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/staff/george-chakravarthi|publisher=University of Brighton|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakravarthi studied at the [[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts|University of Brighton]], the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and the [[Royal College of Art]].&lt;ref name="InIVA - George Chakravarthi"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Chakravarthi – Artist|url=http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/c/chakravarthi_george|publisher=InIVA|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Photo Booth Self Portraits by George Chakravarthi.jpg|thumb|x160px|left|Early photo booth self-portraits by Chakravarthi]]
Chakravarthi was born in [[New Delhi]], India on 26 November 1969 to parents with origins in [[Tamil Nadu]], India and [[British Burma]]. His parents considered the education of their children a priority, so the family lived very modestly in order for him and his siblings to be privately educated while in India. Chakravarthi attended [[St. Columba's School, Delhi]],&lt;ref name="St. Columba's website"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Columba's School, Delhi website|url=http://stcolumbas.net/home.jsp|publisher=St. Columba's School, Delhi|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English-medium school run by a Roman Catholic brotherhood ([[Congregation of Christian Brothers]]). Although nominally brought up as a Catholic, Chakravarthi's family encouraged him to absorb and be influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="www.georgechakravarthi.com - Biographical information"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Chakravarthi – Bio|url=http://www.georgechakravarthi.com/bio/|publisher=George Chakravarthi|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nikki Millican interview by Zane Trow"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millican|first1=Nikki|title=Being, not performing|url=http://www.realtimearts.net/article/issue50/6849|publisher=Brisbane Powerhouse Centre for the Live Arts|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Chakravarthi moved with his family to the UK.&lt;ref name="dislocation" /&gt; This was around the time of the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton]] and other riots,&lt;ref name="BBC Brixton riots"&gt;{{cite web|title=1981: Brixton riots report blames racial tension|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546233.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the peaks for organised [[Racism in the United Kingdom|racism]] and electoral success of the far-right ([[National Front (UK) election results#General election, 3 May 1979|National Front General election results in May 1979]]). Mary Brennan, reviewing the [[National Review of Live Art]] in 2001, described the effect on Chakravarthi of his move to the UK as follows:
{{Cquote|''[He] entered into a kind of mirror-maze, where he found himself searching for a sense of who he was. In time, that quest for identity has embraced issues of iconography, sexuality, race, and gender – all framed, as it were, within a personal reconstruction of familiar fine art.''|author=Mary Brennan&lt;ref name=MaryBrennan2001&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Mary|title=Join in the Mexican wave The events of five packed days of the National Review of Live Art are previewed|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/join-in-the-mexican-wave-the-events-of-five-packed-days-of-the-national-review-of-live-art-are-previewed-by-mary-brennan-1.198774|publisher=Herald Scotland|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
He continued his education at St. Patrick's Primary School&lt;ref name="St Patrick's Catholic Primary School, Plumstead"&gt;{{cite web|title=St Patrick's Catholic Primary School, Plumstead|url=http://www.stpatricksprimary.org.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Paul's Academy, Abbey Wood|St. Paul's Secondary School]] in south London, both Roman Catholic, multi-cultural schools. He began documenting his reactions to his new environment and his changing identity through writing and drawing, and then making photographic self-portraits (initially using [[photo booth]]s&lt;ref name="LADA unSeen"&gt;{{cite web|title=unSeen|url=http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/publishing/unseen/|publisher=Live Art Development Agency|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dislocation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keegan|first1=Sinead|title=The discloted artist|url=https://allthesins.co.uk/2017/05/18/the-dislocated-artist/|website=All the sins|publisher=All the sins|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he was given a camera by the sculptor and photographer Hamish Horsley&lt;ref name="Hamish Horsley website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horsley|first1=Hamish|title=Hamish Horsley|url=http://hamishhorsley.com/|publisher=Hamish Horsley|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Chakravarthi left home at the age of 16 and eventually settled in a modest flat in [[Greenwich]], London. He had a variety of jobs including stacking shelves in supermarkets, as a go-go dancer in various nightclubs and as a photographic and artist's model. He attended a short course in photography at the Thames Independent Photography Project (TIPP) where his interest in photography and particularly making self-portraits was encouraged.&lt;ref name="BBC Shooting Live" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Chakravarthi was an undergraduate at the [[University of Brighton]]. He obtained a first-class [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Visual and Performance Art. For the degree show he submitted ''′Resurrection′'' (a photograph 12 feet by 5 feet) and a live performance, the subject of both was [[Last Supper|The Last Supper]], with Chakravarthi in the place of Jesus and women dressed in saris in the positions of the disciples, as depicted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resurrection|url=http://www.georgechakravarthi.com/photography/|publisher=George Chakravarthi|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an award from [[Nagoya University]] for outstanding artistic achievement.

He started his postgraduate studies at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and, after taking a year out, he completed his [[Master of Arts]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] in 2003. For the final show at the Royal College of Art, he submitted ''′Olympia′'', a video installation based on [[Olympia (Manet)|the painting]] by [[Édouard Manet]], with Chakravarthi in the position of the nude woman and a white man in the place of the black servant woman;&lt;ref name="youtube olympia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympia by George Chakravarthi|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBxoC0CASfw|publisher=Youtube/George Chakravarthi|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it won him the Chris Garnham Award for 'Best Use of Photography'.

== Themes ==
A number of common themes are apparent in Chakravarthi’s work including:
* '''Self-portraiture''': All of Chakravarthi's works are various forms of [[self-portrait]].
* '''Identity''': Chakravarthi adopts numerous [[alter ego]]s with different [[Identity (social science)|identities]] in his work; for example, he is male in some of the pieces within ''‘Thirteen’'', female for one of the characters in ''‘Memorabilia/Aradhana’'', transgender in ''‘Barflies’'', gay in ''‘I Feel Love!’'' and Indian in ''‘Andhaka’''.
* '''Race/multi-culturalism/racism''': Jesus in ''‘Resurrection’'' is Indian and his hair, scattered over the table, is black in contrast to the (apparently) red hair of the white Jesus in Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'', and the female disciples are all dressed in traditional Indian saris reflecting Chakravarthi's [[cultural heritage]] (see the image of this work above). In ''‘Olympia’'' the servant is white and the “mistress” is Indian (see the image of this work above). ''‘Negrophilia’''  takes on the dichotomy between the fascination of some white audiences with black performers, e.g. [[Josephine Baker]] in Paris, and racist imagery in Hollywood cinema of the same era, e.g. the number ''′[http://vimeo.com/24008320 Hot Voodoo]′'' in ''[[Blonde Venus]]'', 1932  (Chakravarthi appears on stage in a gorilla costume), and subtly refers to evolution (ape to homo sapiens, and the origin of homo sapiens in the African continent).
* '''Gender/sexism/feminism''': The female character in ''‘Memorabilia/Aradhana’'' is cast as a person to be married off and produce children for her husband. The twelve apostles in ''‘Resurrection’'' are all female, possibly alluding to the women apostles referred to in non-canonical Christian texts and in the Bible in Romans 16:7 ([[female disciples of Jesus]]). ''‘Miss UK’'', ''‘Masking’'' and ''‘Barflies’'' in particular address [[Feminism|feminist politics]].
* '''Sexuality/transvestitism''': Chakravarthi dresses as female characters in many of his pieces of work, these include; ''‘Memorabilia/Aradhana’'', ''‘Shakti’'', ''‘Barflies’'', ''‘Negrophilia’'', some of the pieces within ''‘Thirteen’'', ''‘Miss UK’'' and ''‘Andhaka’''. In others (''‘Remotecontrol’'' and ''‘Olympia’'') the characters are androgynous. ''‘To the Man in my Dreams’'' can be interpreted as a son coming out to his father, or the correspondence between a gay man in a role-play relationship with an older man, among other possibilities. Chakravarthi’s character in ''‘I Feel Love!’'' (in terms of dress, the music used and his placement on a plinth) is probably based on a go-go dancer in a gay club.
* '''Self image/idealisation of image''': ''‘Remotecontrol’'', ''‘I Feel Love!’'', ''‘Barflies’'' and ''‘Miss UK’'' all concern themselves with striving to have the ‘right’ image whether in terms of body, dress or age.
* '''Religion''': ''‘Shakti’'' and ''‘Andhaka’'' explicitly refer to the Indian goddess [[Kali]], and the [[Last Supper]] from the Bible is the subject of ''‘Resurrection’''. The layering of the components within the images of ''‘Thirteen’'' gives them an appearance of stained glass, particularly when displayed backlit in light boxes (see the photograph above of some of these images backlit in an exhibition), this may be a more subtle religious reference.
* '''Iconic paintings''': A number of iconic paintings are specifically and unmistakably referenced by some of Chakravarthi's pieces, with details of the sets as well as the main subjects; Da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in ''‘Shakti’'' and also his ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' in ''‘Resurrection’'', and Manet's ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' in ''‘Olympia’''. The use of gold and jewels in ''Cleopatra'' (within ''‘Thirteen’'') is reminiscent of works by [[Gustav Klimt|Klimt]] (e.g. ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I|Adele Bloch-Bauer]]'', 1907). Numerous paintings by [[Titian]] (e.g. ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'', 1548) make dramatic use of clouds as does Chakravarthi's ''Lady Macbeth'' (also within ''‘Thirteen’'') – see the third image from the right in the photograph above of some of the images from ''‘Thirteen’''.

[[File:Manweissabgleich.jpg|thumb|Image before (left) and after (right) adjustment with gray card (middle)]]
A '''gray card''' is a [[middle gray]] reference, typically used together with a reflective [[light meter]], as a way to produce consistent image  [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] and/or [[color]] in [[film]] and [[photography]].

A gray card is a flat object of a neutral gray color that derives from a flat reflectance spectrum. A typical example is the Kodak R-27 set, which contains two 8x10" cards and one 4x5" card which have 18% reflectance across the visible spectrum, and a white reverse side which has 90% reflectance. Note that flat spectral reflectance is a stronger condition than simply appearing neutral; this flatness ensures that the card appears neutral under any illuminant (see [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]]).

== Application ==

A major use of gray cards is to provide a standard reference object for exposure determination in photography. A gray card is an (approximate) realization of a [[Lambertian]] scatterer; its apparent brightness (and exposure determination) therefore depends only on its orientation relative to the light source. By placing a gray card in the scene to be photographed, oriented toward the direction of the incident light, and taking a reading from it with a reflected light meter, the photographer can be assured of consistent exposures across their photographs. This technique is similar to using an incident meter, as it depends on the illuminance but not the reflectivity of the subject. (Of course taking photographs with side lighting or back lighting implies that the gray card should be oriented toward the camera instead.)

In addition to providing a means for measuring exposure, a gray card provides a convenient reference for white balance, or [[color balance]], allowing the camera to compensate for the illuminant color in a scene.

Gray cards can be used for in-camera white balance or post-processing white balance. Many [[digital camera]]s have a custom white balance feature. A photo of the gray card is taken and used to set white balance for a sequence of photos. For post-processing white balance, a photo of the gray card in the scene is taken, and the image processing software uses the data from the pixels in the gray card area of the photo to set the white balance point for the whole image.

Most digital cameras do a reasonable job of controlling color but they might get it wrong.
For the casual user, a gray card is mostly unnecessary. Many serious photographers or hobbyists consider gray cards an essential part of the digital photography process.

Gray cards are made of a variety of materials including plastic, paper, and foam. Some photographers hold{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} that any neutral white or gray surface, such as a white piece of paper, a concrete or stone wall, or a white shirt are suitable substitutes for a gray card; however, since bright white papers and clothing washed in typical detergents contain [[fluorescent whitening agent]]s, they tend to not be very spectrally neutral.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

 | work = Mini-Encyclopedia of Papermaking Wet-End Chemistry
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray cards specially made to be spectrally flat are therefore more suitable to the purpose than surfaces that happen to be available.

== Limitations ==

A gray card is useful for setting or correcting the balance of neutral colors, as well as for exposure.  Other charts, such as various [[color chart]]s, provide standard reference patterns with calibrated reflectance spectrum and color coordinates, for use in adjusting color rendering in a larger range of situations.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

[[File:Grevensvaenge Schnabel.jpg|thumb|1779 drawing by Marcus Schnabel]]
The '''Grevensvænge hoard''' is a find of the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (roughly dating to between 800 BC and 500 BC), discovered in the late 18th century at Grevensvænge, [[Næstved Municipality]], [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]].
The hoard consisted of seven bronze figurines. Its first mention is in 1779, where it is said to have been found in the ground "a few years ago". After their discovery, they were kept with the pastor at [[Herlufmagle]], Marcus Schnabel.

A drawing of four of the figurines was made in 1779, by Schnabel. The drawing shows two kneeling figures of warriors with [[horned helmet]]s and axes, a leaping acrobat, and a standing woman. Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the [[Danish National Museum]] in 1823 and 1839. 

Based on comparison with [[petroglyphs]] of the same era (e.g. [[Tanumshede]], Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.

Both the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into [[pre-Roman Iron Age|early Germanic culture]]. The kneeling warrior figures have been interpreted as the "[[Ashvins]]" type [[divine twins]] of early Indo-European religion, sons of the sky-god, known by the name of [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]] to Tacitus.

'''''Hibernicus exul''''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 8th century) was an anonymous [[Hiberno-Latin|Irish Latin]] [[poet]], [[Philologist|grammarian]], and [[dialectician]]. His works include a comic mock epic, a panegyric to [[Charlemagne]], epigrams of advice to young scholars and a poetic overview of the seven [[liberal arts]].

==Overview==

''Hibernicus exul'' is [[Latin]] for "[[Hibernia]]n [[exile]]", and this is the name given to an anonymous [[Hiberno-Latin]] poet of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] who lived and wrote in [[Francia]]. The poet has been variously identified with both [[Dungal]] and [[Dicuil]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Lisa Taylor, ''Epic Lives and Monasticism in the Middle Ages, 800–1050'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight of his poems are extant, all of which are preserved in a single manuscript in the [[Vatican Library]] (Bibl. Apostolica, Reg. lat. 2078).

==''Ad Karolum Regem''==

The anonymous exile's most famous work is a fragmentary Latin [[eclogue]] praising [[Charlemagne]] for his defeat of [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] in 787.

The poem, ''Ad Karolum Regem'' (To King Charles) in the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] and ''In Praise of Poetry'' in Peter Godman's excerpted English translation, is written as a dialogue between poet and [[Muse]] (the parts of which are difficult for modern editors to perfectly discern), an idea picked up by [[Walahfrid Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''editio princeps'' is [[Ernst Dümmler]], ''MGH'', ''Poetae Latini medii aevi'', I (Berlin, 1881); Peter Godman (1985), ''Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), pp. 24&amp;ndash;25, discusses the poem briefly and provides a critical edition and translation of it, pp 174&amp;ndash;79. The poem is the earliest Carolingian eclogue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem begins with a description of Charlemagne and Tassilo, ''dux inclitus'' (distinguished duke). Charlemagne's gifts to the disobedient Tassilo, Tassilo's ceremonious submission and payment of tribute, and the reconciliation of the two Christian princes are the major themes of the opening part of the work. The remainder is filled by the dialogue of the humble poet and the Muse who shows him the immortality of poetry.

To the historian, the ''exul''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s poem indicates the high value ascribed to generosity and reconciliation amongst Christians and portrays the defeated duke in a fair light.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Airlie (1999), "Narratives of Triumph and Rituals of Submission: Charlemagne's Mastering of Bavaria", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', Sixth Series, '''9''' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-77286-9}}.), p. 112, demonstrates the Christian moral tone and the evenhanded treatment of Tassilo.&lt;/ref&gt; The exaltation of poetry (by a poet) was necessary in a world that concentrated on material and especially martial success. The poet also affirms that secular subjects are equally worthy as sacred ones for versification; one of the earliest Latin Christian defences of [[Curia regis|courtly]]/[[public]] [[panegyric]].

==Epigrams==

''Hibernicus exul'' also wrote a couple of Latin [[epigram]]s illustrating two contrasting [[pedagogical]] methods: encouragement and threat.&lt;ref&gt;Godman provides a translation of these two on pp. 178&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; The first draws on proverbs in the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' and goes like this:
{{Verse translation|lang=la|
Discite nunc, pueri! Docilis cito vertitur aetas,
:Tempora praetereunt axe rotante diem.
Ardenti ut sonipes carpit celer aequora cursu,
:Sic volat, heu, iuvenis non remanente gradu.
Curvantur facili vi lenta cacumina virgae,
:Sed rigidos ramos flectere nemo valet.
Dum faciles animi vobis sint forte, sodales,
:Discere ne pigeat scita superna dei.
Ne bene concessum spatium perdatis inane,
:Nam sine doctrina vita perit hominum.
|
Learn now, boys! The age for learning passes swiftly,
:time goes by, as the heavens revolve the days follow.
Just as the swift charger gallops eagerly over the fields,
:so youth flies by without lingering as it passes.
The pliant tip of the twig curves beneath an easy pressure
:but no one can bend the stiff boughs.
While your minds happen to be receptive, my friends,
:waste no time and learn the divine commands of God.
Do not squander the period generously granted to you,
:for without learning the life of man perishes.}}

==Critical thoughts on the poems==

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' has the following to say of Hibernicus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The poems of this exile show that he was not only a [[poet]] but a [[Philologist|grammarian]] and [[dialectician]] as well. They also reveal his status as that of a teacher, probably in the [[palace school]]. Of more than ordinary interest are the verses which describe the attitude of the ninth-century teacher towards his pupils. His metrical poem on the [[seven liberal arts]] devotes twelve lines to each of the branches, [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[dialectic]], etc., showing the origin, scope, and utility of each in succession. Like the lines on the same subject by [[Theodulf of Orléans]], they may have been intended to accompany a set of pictures in which the seven liberal arts were represented. The style of these poems, while much inferior to that of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] is free from many of the artificialities which characterize much of the versification of the early [[Middle Ages]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts''', [[New Delhi]] ([[IGNCA]]) is a premier government-funded arts organization in India. It is an autonomous institution under the Union [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]]. It was established in the memory of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], with [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] as its founding director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://www.ignca.nic.in/about.htm |date= |publisher=IGNCA Official website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The IGNCA was launched on 19 November 1985 by Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi at a function where the symbolism of the components was clearly articulated at different levels. The elements - fire, water, earth, sky and vegetation - were brought together. Five rocks from five major rivers - Sindhu ([[Indus]]), [[Ganga]], [[Kaveri]], [[Mahanadi]] and the [[Narmada]] (where the most ancient ammonite fossils are found) were composed into sculptural forms. These remain at the site as reminders of the antiquity of Indian culture and the sacredness of her rivers and rocks.

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Trust was constituted and registered at New Delhi on 24 March 1987.
==About==

[[File:Joseph Melling-Musée des Arts décoratifs de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|215px|Self-portrait (date unknown)]]
'''Joseph Melling''' (27 December 1724, [[Saint-Avold]] - 23 December 1796, [[Strasbourg]]) was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] artist who served as [[court painter]] for the [[Margraviate of Baden]] at [[Karlsruhe Palace]].

== Biography ==
He came from a long-established line of painters, etchers, architects and woodcarvers. His father came to Saint-Avold to participate in the rebuilding of a monastery and its church. He attended the [[Lateinschule]] in [[Saarlouis]] and went to Paris to complete an apprenticeship in carpentry. After that, he studied with [[Carle van Loo]] and [[François Boucher]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{NDB|17|25|26|Melling, Joseph|Rosemarie Stratmann-Döhler|123757630}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, he was awarded the [[Prix de Rome]] in painting for his version of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] giving his daughter to [[Jacob]]. It is not clear if he went to Rome, but it is probable that he did some church painting with his uncle {{ill|Valentin Metzinger|sh}} in Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]).
[[File:Melling Prix de Rome.JPG|thumb|left|185px|Laban Giving his Daughter to Jacob.]]
In 1758, he joined his brother, the sculptor Christoph Melling (1716-1778), as a court painter in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The following year, he married Josepha Lengelacher, the daughter of his brother's supervisor, the sculptor {{ill|Ignác Lengelacher|cs}}. In 1760, he completed a ceiling painting in the large marble hall of the Palace and, in 1764, decorated the altar at the Stadtkirche in [[Rastatt]]. He also served as an advisor to Countess [[Landgravine Caroline Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt|Karoline Luise]], helping her to acquire an art collection that later became the basis of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

In later years, he travelled throughout the area. In 1769, he painted a ceiling [[fresco]] and altarpieces for the monastery church in [[Friesenheim (Baden-Württemberg)|Schuttern]]. The same year, he did decorations at the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery in [[Baden-Baden]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The year 1770 found him in [[Hechingen]], creating altarpieces for the [[Collegiate church|Stiftskirche]]. Two years later, he was in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] doing a large mural for the Grand Ducal Palace.
[[File:Karoline Luise von Baden-Durlach.jpg|thumb|275px|Karoline Luise and her sons; Karl Ludwig and Friedrich.]]
For many years, he operated a drawing school in what was once the palace's [[menagerie]]. His daughter Marie Luise (1762–1799) was one of his first students. Later, she took the name "Maria Rosa" and entered [[Lichtenthal Abbey]], where she helped him paint murals in the meeting hall.

In 1774, for financial reasons, he left Karlsruhe for Strasbourg, where he founded an art school; the "Academie de déssin d’après nature".&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He retained his contacts with the court, however and, after the death of Karoline Luise in 1783, created a catalog and directory of her collection. In 1789, during the [[French Revolution]], his school was superseded by a system of centrally-controlled state schools. Six years later, he was able to open a private school, supported by his son, the painter Joseph Ignaz Melling (1764–1817), who later operated his own art school in Rastatt.

'''''Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx''''' is a painting by the Flemish [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Joachim Patinier]]. Dating to c. 1515–1524, it is in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

''Landscape with Charon Crossing Styx'' fits into common Northern Renaissance and early Mannerist trends of art. The 16th century witnessed a new era for painting in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] that combined influences from local traditions and foreign influences. Many artists, including Patinier, traveled to [[Italy]] to study and these travels to the south provided new ideas, particular concerning representations of the natural world. Patinier's religious subjects, therefore, incorporate precise observation and naturalism with fantastic landscapes inspired by the northern traditions of Bosch.

==Iconography==
It depicts the classical subject related by [[Virgil]] in his ''Aeneid'' (book 6, line 369) and [[Dante]] in the ''Inferno'' (book 3, line 78) at the centre of the picture within the [[Christian]] traditions of the [[Last Judgment]] and the [[Ars moriendi]]. The larger figure in the boat is [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who transports the souls of the dead to the gates of [[Hades]]. The passenger in the boat, too minute to distinguish his expressions, is a human soul deciding between [[Heaven]], to his right (the viewer's left), or [[Hell]], to his left. The river [[Styx]] divides the painting down the centre. It is one of the four rivers of the underworld that passes through the deepest part of hell. On the painting's left side is the fountain of [[Paradise]], the spring from which the river [[Lethe]] flows through Heaven.

On the right side of the composition is Patinier's vision of Hell, drawing largely on [[Hieronymus Bosch|Boschian]] influences. He adapts a description of [[Hades]], in which,  according to the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer Pausanias, one of the gates was located at the southern end of the Peloponnesus, in an inlet still visible on the [[Cape Matapan]]. In front of the gates is [[Cerberus]], a three-headed dog, who guards the entrance of the gate and frightens all the potential souls who enter into Hades. The soul in the boat ultimately chooses his destiny by looking toward Hell and ignoring the angel on the river-bank in Paradise that beckons him to the more difficult path to Heaven.

==Composition and colour==
Patinier utilised a ''[[Weltlandschaft]]'' ("world landscape") composition with a three-colour scheme typical of his work, moving from brown in the foreground, to bluish-green, to pale blue in the background). This format, which Patiner is widely acknowledged as popularising, provides a bird's-eye view over an expansive landscape. Furthermore, the painting uses colour to visibly depict heaven and hell, good and evil. To the viewer's left is a heavenly place with bright blue skies, crystal blue rivers with a luminous fountain and angels accenting the grassy hills. On the far right of the painting is a dark sky engulfing Hell and the hanged figures on its gate. Fires blaze in the hills. The foreground of the painting consists of brown rocks in Heaven and brown burnt trees in Hell. 

In the middle-ground is the river and the grasslands in bright hues of blue and green. The background, which is cut off by the horizon line of the darker blue river, is a pale blue sky highlighted with white and gray clouds.  This compositional form is applied here by the crowded left and right sides bracketed by hills, which pushes the viewer's eye into the open space in the middle and reinforces that the men in the boat are the main focus of the painting.

The '''learned pig''' was a pig taught to respond to commands in such a way that it appeared to be able to answer questions by picking up cards in its mouth. By choosing cards it answered [[Arithmetics|arithmetical problems]] and spelled out words. The "learned pig" caused a sensation in London during the 1780s. It became a common object of satire, illustrated in caricatures and referred to in literature.

The original "learned pig" was followed by other trained pigs, which subsequently became a feature of fairs and other public attractions in Europe and America during the 19th century. In the words of G.E. Bentley, "They served as subjects for cartoons by Rowlandson and moral essays in children's books and savage doggerel by Blake, and they illustrated the manners of the English in works by Joseph Strutt and Robert Southey and Thomas Hood. These freaks of learning clearly exercised a fascination among the literary geniuses of the age as they did among the swinish multitude."&lt;ref name = "bent"&gt;G.E. Bentley, "The Freaks of Learning", ''Colby Quarterly'', Vol. 18, Iss. 2, 1982, Art. 3, pp.88-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The original pig==
The original Learned Pig was trained by a Scotsman Samuel Bisset, who ran a travelling novelty show. The idea of an "intellectual" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as "[[Bankes's Horse|Marocco]] the thinking horse" (c.1586–c.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the "horse of knowledge", exhibited for example at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ''Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry'', University of Chicago Press, 2002, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt; But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before.

The pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain.&lt;ref name ="jan"&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''The feejee mermaid and other essays in natural and unnatural history'', Cornell University Press, 1999, pp.20-28&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; According to publicity at the time,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and distinguishes all sorts of colours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to "discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille".&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

The phenomenon caused much comment. [[James Boswell]] recalls conversations with [[Samuel Johnson]] in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that  "the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. ''Pig'' has, it seems, not been wanting to ''man'', but ''man'' to ''pig''. We do not allow ''time'' for his education, we kill him at a year old." Another man present joked that [[Alexander Pope]] would not have used the pig as a symbol of "the lowest degree of grovelling instinct" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: "the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been ''educated'', and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture."&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'', July 12, 1784.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book ''The Robin Redbreasts'' (1788), "designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals", mentions the pig in chapter entitled "The Cruel Boy": aiming to teach that animals are not "mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, "which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think".

==Later pigs==
[[File:Toby the sapient pig.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for Toby the Sapient Pig]]
In 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States. William Frederick Pinchbeck displayed a "Pig of Knowledge" in [[New England]]. He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President [[John Adams]], to "universal applause".&lt;ref&gt;David Morgan, Sally M. Promey, ''The visual culture of American religions'', University of California Press, 2001, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Pinchbeck, ''The Expositor, or, Many Mysteries Unravelled. Delineated in a Series of Letters, between a Friend and his Correspondent. Comprising the Learned Pig, Invisible Lady and Acoustic Temple, Philosophical Swan, Penetrating Spy Glasses, Optical and Magnetic, and Various other Curiosities on similar Principles: Also, A few of the most wonderful Feats as performed by the Art of Legerdemain: With Some Reflections on Ventriloquism'', Boston, 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting that it was better to "coax" the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to the slightest hints of movement from the trainer.&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that "his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...[his trainer] familiarly corresponded with the devil." Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: "the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, Nicholas Hoare, an illusionist, exhibited "Toby the sapient pig" in London. Toby could "discover a person’s thoughts", a skill "never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, ''The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself''.

A pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from "Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher." He answered questions by "pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience."&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Altick, ''The Shows of London'' (1978), p. 37-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Toby" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a "year ago at Camberwell Fair" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled "vittels," and then it left to have some, "with a joyful grunt, and the show was over."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

==Caricature==
[[File:Downfall of taste.JPG|thumb|''The Downfall of Taste and Genius'' (1784). The classical muses flee while the Learned Pig leads an assault on the arts, as Shakespeare's and Pope's works are cast aside.]]

The original learned pig inspired a large number of satirical comments and comic prints. [[Thomas Rowlandson]] published a caricature of "The Wonderful Pig"  in 1785, in which the pig is shown displaying his erudition to a crowd of amazed ladies and gentlemen. A placard states "The Surprising PIG well versed in all Languages, perfect Arethmatician Mathematician &amp; Composer of Musick."&lt;ref name ="mar"&gt;Mary George, ''Catalogue of the Political and Personal Satires preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum'', Vol. VI 1784— 1792, British Museum, 1938, pp. xxvi, 197; 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other caricatures used the appeal of the pig to poke fun at theatrical fads of the day. ''The Theatrical War'' satirises the actor-impresario [[John Palmer (actor)|John Palmer]], dressed in Shakespearean costume, being threatened by other attractions including the pig.

The 1784 print ''The Downfall of Taste and Genius, or, The World As it Goes'' by [[Samuel Collings]] ridicules "the taste that prefers the Dancing Dogs, the Learned Pig, and Harlequin to Shakespeare". This was a "recurrent theme" of prints at the time.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt; The print depicts the pig leading a procession of performing animals who knock over figures representing the fine arts while copies of Shakespeare's and Pope's works are trampled underfoot by the animals.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keen, "The 'Ballonomania': Science and Spectacle in 1780s England", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 39/4, 2006, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous print entitled "The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge" shows a pig performing in a parlour apparently engaged in spelling the word "PORC[INE]"

Politicians were also satirised by being compared to the pig. [[William Pitt the younger|William Pitt]] was referred to as "the Wonderful Pig" on several occasions. One satirical print showed Pitt with the body of a pig; the caption asserted that among his powers was the ability to explain recent Acts of Parliament, a feat "before never having been even ''attempted'' in these our realms!!!" In one print Pitt and his opponent [[Charles James Fox]] were both depicted as competing learned pigs.&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Toby learned pig.JPG|left|thumb|Toby learning Latin grammar, a caricature by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].]]
The concept of the "learned pig" became a common motif in satirical literature by the late 18th century, playing on the implied contrast between gross physicality and intellectual superiority. The poet [[William Cowper]] lamented that his fame had been unfavourably compared to both the pig and a "prostitute" (the notoriously promiscuous actress [[George Anne Bellamy|Anne Bellamy]]).&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt; A poem published in 1785 referred to the fact that the pig had arrived in London just after Johnson's death,

:Though Johnson, learned Bear, is gone,
:Let us no longer mourn our loss,
:For lo, a learned Hog is come,
:And wisdom grunts at Charing Cross.

The anonymous pamphlet ''The Story of the Learned Pig, By an officer of the Royal Navy'' (1786) picked up the theme of reincarnation. This presents itself as the personal reminiscences of the pig, as told to the author. He describes himself as a soul that has successively migrated from the body of [[Romulus]] into various humans and animals before becoming the Learned Pig. He recalls his previous incarnations. After Romulus he became [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], and then entered several human and animal bodies. Adapting the Shakespeare theme, the pamphlet states that he became a man called "Pimping Billy", who worked as a horse-holder at a playhouse with Shakespeare and was the real author of his plays. He then became a famous British aristocrat and general — identified only by asterisks — before entering the body of a pig.&lt;ref&gt;McMichael, George L.; Glenn, Edgar M. (1962), Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy, Odyssey Press, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puns on the name "Bacon", referring to the philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], also appeared in the literature. In the poem "The Prophetic Pig", in ''The Whim of the Day'' (c.1794) a believer in reincarnation states, "I can easily trace...A metempsychosis in this pig's face!...And in transmigration, if I'm not mistaken,/This learned pig must be, by consanguinity,/Descended from the great Lord Bacon."&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted under the title "The Fortune Teller" in [[Thomas Tegg]], ''The Vocal Annual, or Singer's own book for 1831: a collection of the newest and most popular songs of the day'', London Tegg, 1831, p.275-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''The Lament of Toby, The Learned Pig'' also uses the Bacon pun, adding another on the poet [[James Hogg]]. He describes the thoughts of a learned pig forced to retire from his intellectual pursuits to be fattened for slaughter. The pig says "Goodbye to the poetic Hogg!/The philosophic Bacon!":

:In this world, pigs, as well as men,
:Must dance to fortune's fiddlings,
:But must I give the classics up,
:For barley-meal and middlings?

[[William Blake]] attacked debased public taste in a poem dedicated to the artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], writing that the nation which neglected Barry might "give pensions to the Learned Pig / Or the Hare playing on a Tabor".&lt;ref name = "cat"&gt;V.A.C. Cattrell, ''City of laughter: sex and satire in eighteenth-century London'', Atlantic, 2006, p.42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; He also alludes to it in his satire ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, ''Blake'', London: Vintage, 1995, pp.92-5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807 [[Robert Southey]] parodied the contrast between real genius and meretricious celebrity by referring to the pig, noting that "the learned pig was in his day a far greater object of admiration to the English nation than ever was Sir Isaac Newton."&lt;ref name = "cat"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] refers to the pig in ''[[The Prelude]]'', describing it as one of the "freaks of nature" to be seen at [[Bartholomew Fair]]:

:...Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
:The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig
:All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
:All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
:Of man, his dulness, madness, and their feats
:All jumbled up together, to compose
:A Parliament of Monsters.&lt;ref&gt;William Wordsworth, ''The Prelude'', Book VII, lines 715-721&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig continued to be a common reference point for writers, mentioned by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and [[Charles Dickens]] among others. In ''[[The Mudfog Papers]]'' Dickens describes a moving lecture given at the ''Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything'' by Mr Blunderum on the dying moments of the learned pig. The lecturer was asked whether the learned pig was related to the [[Pig-faced women#The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square|Pig-faced Lady]], causing embarrassment to an audience member who ''was'' related to the lady, but who refused to admit a family connection to the learned pig.

Even [[Mrs Beeton]] begins her recipe for cooking sucking pig with the observation that pigs are capable of "education" "and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness". This is proven by "the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month, hour and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory."&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management'' (Nicola Humble, editor), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, the "Learned Pig" has made a reappearance of sorts in popular culture; in 2003 he was the subject of a song, "The Learned Pig," which was part of a concept concert and recording by the UK band the [[Tiger Lillies]], based on a poem by [[Edward Gorey]]. The musical "Toby the Incredible Learned Pig", written by Daniel Freedman, was a finalist in the Wonderland One Act Festival at Theater Works 42nd St. NYC in 2007. In 2011 there appeared a novel, ''Pyg: The Memoirs of a Learned Pig'', by [[Russell Potter]], based on the career of the original "Toby". ({{ISBN|0857862405}})

==Characters==
*'''Louis "Louie" Anderson''' (voiced by Louie Anderson) Based on Anderson's younger self. Louie is an eight-year-old child, living in the fictional town of Cedar Knoll, [[Wisconsin]]. He is a very sensitive, impressionable, and intelligent young boy. He often uses his gifted sense of humor to deal with difficult situations. He always stands up for his own rights and principles, but also for those of others. His most notable catchphrase used in the series is, "All right!"
*'''Jeannie Harper''' (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]) - Louie's best friend. She often defends Louie from local bullies. Louie has a crush on her.
*'''Michael "Mike" Grunewald''' (voiced by [[Justin Shenkarow]]) - Louie's friend with a sarcastic sense of humor. He has a somewhat chill attitude and comes from a rather wealthy family, much to Louie's jealousy.
*'''Toddler Tobolinski''' - Louie's other friend. He is somewhat shorter than the others, about the same height as Louie, and loves activities like recess.
*'''Scott Jensen''' - One of Louie's friends. He appears quite often in the 1st and 3rd seasons. But he is rarely seen in the 2nd season.
*'''Andrew "Andy" Mortimer Anderson''' (voiced by Louie Anderson) - Louie's difficult, but caring father. He is a veteran of [[World War II]] and likes to tell his family stories about his experience at the front in Europe. Much of the humor regarding Andy, involved his comic superiority complex and equally comical unawareness of his own limitations. Though he often appeared out of touch with reality, Andy was secretly a very gifted chess player, a skill Louie briefly displayed possessing, but he hid his gift during the latter half of his life because of the way he was supposedly mistreated for it in his youth (he even went so far as to disguise himself at chess tournaments so he would not be recognized). He is a proud owner of a [[Rambler Six and V8|Rambler]] sedan&lt;ref name="RamblerMan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229993/ |title=Life with Louie, Season 1, Episode 12, "Born a Rambler Man" |publisher=www.imdb.com |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most probably a 1959 Rambler Six), that appears on the show in various episodes. His catchphrases: "For crying out loud!" and "I heard that." Despite his appearance, he is a very caring and loving person.
*'''Ora Anderson''' (voiced by [[Edie McClurg]]) - Louie's kind, loving and sweet natured mother. She usually acts as the voice of reason for Louie and Andy.
*'''Thomas "Tommy" Anderson''' (voiced by [[Miko Hughes]]) -  Louie's youngest brother. Louie teases him a lot in the beginning.
*'''Glen Glenn''' (voiced by Justin Shenkarow) - The local bully of Louie’s school who teases Louie and other children. His mother '''Jen Glenn''' has a huge temper and loud voice which the other citizens don't like.
*'''Craig Eric, Paul George''' - Glen Glenn's friends.
*'''The Melvins''' - A group of chess nerds. One of them is actually named Franklin but is still called Melvin.
*'''Henrietta Shermann''' - Louie's grandmother, mother of Ora. She dies in one of the episodes.
*'''Pepper''' - Louie's obese pet goldfish.
*'''Sid Anderson, John Anderson, Danny Anderson, Peter Anderson''' - Louie's older brothers.
*'''Mr. Jensen, Earl Grunewald, Gus Williams, Mrs. Stillman''' - Louie's neighbors
*''' Laura Anderson, Carol Anderson, Charlie Anderson,  Julie Anderson''' - Louie's older sisters.

==Intro and theme song==
The show's intro involved the main character running toward a TV set, turning one of the set's dials, and showing a live-action video of Louie Anderson as an adult saying, "Let me tell you about my family." Then after that showing clips of the show from Andy Anderson being pulled by sled dogs, Louie sticking chopsticks in his nose, to Louie jumping off a diving board at a swimming pool nearly wasting all the water and getting most of the other participants wet due to the fact of him being overweight, then the show's logo (in Pink) appears on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, while the main character (wearing sunglasses) eats a dot while sitting on a raft while watching TV on a tire. The intro was used from season 2 to the last season. Season 1 episodes used a live-action intro by Louie Anderson talking to the audience about his childhood, then dissolving into the show.

==Home videos and merchandise==
Based on the popularity of the show, various merchandise was released including apparel, videos of various episodes, a "Lake Winnibigoshish" [[CD-ROM]] [[comic book]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NJDX2U |title=Life with Louie ~ Lake Winnibigoshish |work=Amazon.com |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book series for children. The book series was based on the various episodes of the show and contained six books in total. [[Kids' meal]] toys were also produced for several [[fast-food restaurant]] chains including [[Taco Bell]] (1996), [[Hardee's]] (1997), [[Jack in the Box]] (1997), and [[Dairy Queen]] (1999).

For a time, Life with Louie-branded Spaghetti-O's, in character shapes, were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsVJ4aXYeOo |title=Life with Louie (S01E04) - Behind Every Good Coach Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2006, TVShowsOnDVD.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=4808 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205010447/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=4808 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2013 |title=Life with Louie - Louie says Louie is coming |date=1 January 2006 |work=tvshowsondvd.com |last=Lacey |first=Gord |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; posted a news story that ''Life with Louie'' was going to be released on DVD in the US.  The information came from Louie Anderson himself who mentioned this news on a radio program he was a guest on, [[KQRS-FM]]. There has been no other news since then and it is now unknown if this series will ever be released on DVD in the United States. However, three 2-episode sets were released in the United Kingdom in summer 2007 as ''Life with Louie: Volume 1'', ''2'', and ''3''. The sets were released through Boulevard Entertainment as part of the Jetix programming brand.

==Awards==
The series won two [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]]. It also won the [[Humanitas Prize]] three times, which is more than for any other animated series.

[[Image:Mice-burying-the-cat.jpg|thumb|''The Mice Are Burying the Cat'', a 1760s lubok print. It has been commonly thought this plot is a caricature of [[Peter the Great]]'s burial, authored by his opponents. The caption above the cat reads: "The Cat of Kazan, the Mind of Astrakhan, the Wisdom of Siberia" (a parody of the [[Style of the Russian sovereign|title of Russian tsars]]). It has been claimed by modern researchers that this is simply a representation of carnivalesque inversion, "turning the world upside down".]]

A '''lubok''' (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|лубо́к, лубо́чная картинка}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were [[woodcut]]s, then [[engraving]]s or [[etching]]s were typical, and from the mid-19th century [[lithography]]. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern [[comic strip]]. Cheap and simple books, similar to [[chapbook]]s,&lt;ref&gt; Lyons, Martyn. "Books: A Living History". Getty Publishing, 2011, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly consisted of pictures, are called '''lubok literature''' or ([[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|лубочная литература}}). Both pictures and literature are commonly referred to simply as ''lubki''. The Russian word ''lubok'' derives from ''lub'' - a special type of board that pictures were printed on.

==Background==
Russian ''lubki'' became a popular [[genre]] during the last half of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=farr1&gt; [[Dianne Ecklund Farrell|Farrell, Dianne Ecklund]]. "Medieval Popular Humor in Russian Eighteenth-Century Lubok". pp. 552&lt;/ref&gt; Russian lubok was primarily influenced by the "woodcuts and engravings done in Germany, Italy, and France during the early part of the fifteenth century".&lt;ref name=farr2&gt; Farrell, Dianne Ecklund. "The Origins of Russian Popular Prints and Their Social Milieu in the Early Eighteenth Century." p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity in Russia was a result of how inexpensive and fairly simple it was to duplicate a print using this new technique.&lt;ref name=farr2/&gt;  Luboks were typically sold at various [[marketplace]]s to the lower and middle classes. This type of art was very popular with these two social classes because the lubok provided them with an inexpensive opportunity to display artwork in their houses.&lt;ref&gt; Jahn, Hubertus F. "Patriotic Culture in Russia During World War I". Cornell University Press: Ithaca and London. p.12 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Затьмачье 01.JPG|thumb|A modern rural shed with lubok decoration]]
The original lubki were woodcuts.&lt;ref name=bogus&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Alexander Boguslawski|Boguslawski, Alexander]]|title="Russian Lubok (Popular Prints)|date=29 January 2007|url=http://www.rollins.edu/Foreign_Lang/Russian/Lubok/lubok.html|accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Koren Picture-Bible, 1692-1696]] established the most prominent style, an "Old Russian" rendering of international [[iconography]] and subjects, most closely related to the [[fresco]]s of the Upper Volga.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Sakovich, Russkaia gravirovannia kniga Vasiliia Korenia, 1692-1696, Moscow, Izdatelstvo "iskusstvo", 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-18th century, however, the woodcuts were mostly replaced with [[engraving]] or [[etching]] techniques, which enabled the prints to be more detailed and complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jahn, Hubertus F]]. "Patriotic Culture in Russia During World War I". Cornell University Press: Ithaca and London. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; After printing on paper, the picture would be hand-colored with diluted [[tempera]] paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Lubok - The Russian Project|date=29 January 2007|url=http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/7309.html|accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the prints themselves were typically very simplistic and unadorned, the final product, with the tempera paint added, was surprisingly bright with vivid colors and lines.  The dramatic coloring of the early woodcut prints was to some extent lost with the transfer to more detailed engravings.&lt;ref name=bogus/&gt;  

In addition to the images, these folk prints would also include a short story or lesson that correlated to the picture being presented. Russian scholar [[Alexander Boguslavsky]] claims that the lubok style "is a combination of Russian icon and manuscript painting traditions with the ideas and topics of western European woodcuts".&lt;ref name=bogus/&gt; Typically, the lubok's artist would include minimal text that was supplementary to the larger illustration that would cover the majority of the engraving.

==Lubok genres==
Folklorist [[Dmitri Rovinsky]] is known for his work with categorizing lubok. His system is very detailed and extensive, and his main categories are as follows: "icons and [[Gospel]] illustrations; the virtues and evils of women; teaching, alphabets, and numbers; calendars and almanacs; light reading; novels, folktales, and hero legends; stories of the [[Passion of Christ]], the [[Last Judgement]], and sufferings of the [[martyr]]s; popular recreation including [[Maslenitsa]] festivities, [[puppet]] comedies, drunkenness, music, dancing, and theatricals; [[jokes]] and [[satires]] related to [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]]; satires adopted from foreign sources; [[folk prayer]]s; and government sponsored pictorial information sheets, including proclamations and news items".&lt;ref name=bogus/&gt; Jewish examples exist as well, mostly from Ukraine. Many ''luboks'' can be classified into multiple categories.

== War lubok ==
[[Image:Kulikovo lubok.jpg|thumb|''The [[Battle of Kulikovo]]''. A large-scale hand-coloured lubok by I.G. Blinov (ink, tempera, gold).]]
[[File:23 Russland. Alexander Apsit (1880-1943) Обманутым Братьям (Die entschlossenen Brüder). 1918. 103 x 68 cm. (Slg.Nr. 475).jpg|thumb|Alexander Apsit (1880-1943): Обманутым братьям (To the deceived brethren). 103 x 68 cm 1918]]

The [[satirical]] version played an important role in the luboks from Russian wartime.  It is used to present [[Napoleon]] in a satirical manner while portraying the Russian peasants as the heroes of the war.  This also inspired other Russians to help fight the war by attempting to, “…redefine Russian national identity in the [[Napoleonic era]]” (Norris 2). The luboks presented a manner for the Russians to mock the French enemy, while at the same time display the ‘Russianness” of Russia.  “These war luboks satirized Napoleon and depicted [[French culture]] as degenerate” (Norris 4).  The lubok was a means of reinforcing the idea of defeating the French invaders and displaying the horrible destruction Napoleon and his army caused Russia.  To help rekindle the Russian spirit the luboks displayed “The experience of the invasion and subsequent Russian winter rendered Napoleon and his troops powerless, and the luboks illustrated this view by depicting the French leader and soldiers as impotent when confronted by peasant men, women, and [[Cossacks]]” (Norris 9).  All the different representation of the Russian heroes helped define and spread the belief in Russian identity.

== Russo-Japanese War lubok ==
The [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905 began on February 8, 1904, at [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]] with a surprise attack by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. At the time, “Russia was an established European power with a large industrial base and a regular army of 1.1 million soldiers. Japan, with few natural resources and little heavy industry, had an army of only 200,000 men”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albro, Walk]]. "Russo-Japanese War's Greatest Land Battle." Military History 21.6 (2005): 58-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the staggering difference in military defense, Russia assumed itself to have the upper hand before the war ensued. Luboks depicting the overconfidence of the Russian army were created because censorship laws at the time did not allow satirical magazines to subsist.

With the use of [[satirical]], often racist cartoons, luboks displayed pictures such as, “a Cossack soldier thrashing a Japanese officer, and a Russian sailor punching a Japanese sailor in the face”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Bryant (historian)|Bryant, Mark]]. "The Floating World at War." History Today 56.6 (2006): 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; These luboks, produced in Moscow and St. Petersburg, were anonymously created and recorded much of the Russo-Japanese War. 

Perhaps due to the Russians' overconfidence, “During the battle, the Japanese generals were able to size up their opponent and predict how he would react under certain circumstances. That knowledge enabled them to set a trap and defeat a numerically superior enemy”.&lt;ref&gt;Albro, Walk. "Russo-Japanese War's Greatest Land Battle." Military History 21.6 (2005): 58-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Russian government eventually stepped in with its censor laws and stopped the creation of more satirical luboks. All in all, around 300 luboks were created during 1904–05.

== Pagan heritage ==
[[File:Babayaga lubok.jpg|thumb|A scuffle of [[Baba Yaga]] (riding a pig) with the Crocodile.]] 

A theme that is presented in luboks is [[paganism]] and other religious elements.  Some of the woodcuts refer to [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and create links to pagan [[cosmology]].  Certain luboks display Hell through [[Last Judgment]] scenes and some of the woodcuts present the [[underworld]].  [[wolf|Wolves]], [[horse]]s, [[reindeer]] and other animals are considered to be the ‘helping animals’ to the sorcerers in the woodcuts.  

Another common element that is shown in the luboks is the portrayal of [[Baba Yaga]] fighting the guardian of the underworld who has reptilian features.  Baba Yaga is dressed in distinctive costumes of elaborate [[embroidery]] and is related to folklore in her being presented as good sometimes and evil at other times.  She is also frequently shown riding a [[pig]] as an identifying trait confirmed by, “Riding pigs was a prominent part of Maslenitsa (the Russian pre-Lenten carnival), and in another luboks a personification of [[Maslenitsa]] is shown riding into Moscow on the back of a pig to initiate the festivities” (Farrell 735).  On the other hand, there is a lubok that presents the entrance to the underworld through Baba Iaga’s mouth, but it is disguised as a pig’s mouth.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Middle Persian literature''' is the corpus of written works composed in [[Middle Persian]], that is, the [[Middle Iranian]] dialect of [[Persis|Persia proper]], the region in the south-western corner of the [[Iranian plateau]]. Middle Persian was the prestige dialect during the era of [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid dynasty]]. 

The rulers of the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224–654 CE) were natives of that south-western region, and through their political and cultural influence, Middle Persian became a [[prestige dialect]] and thus also came to be used by non-Persian Iranians. Following the [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|Arab conquest of the Sassanian Empire]] in the 7th century, shortly after which Middle Persian began to evolve into New Persian, Middle Persian continued to be used by the Zoroastrian priesthood for religious and secular compositions. These compositions, in the Aramaic-derived [[Book Pahlavi]] script, are traditionally known as "Pahlavi literature". The earliest texts in Zoroastrian Middle Persian were probably written down in late Sassanid times (6th–7th centuries), although they represent the codification of earlier oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 141. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt; However, most texts, including the [[Zend|''zand'']] commentaries and translations of the [[Avesta|Zoroastrian canon]], date from the 9th to the 11th century, when Middle Persian had long ceased to be a spoken language, so they reflect the state of affairs in living Middle Persian only indirectly. The surviving manuscripts are usually 14th-century copies.&lt;ref name="LLDescrip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pal|title=Linguist List - Description of Pehlevi|year=2007|publisher=Eastern Michigan University|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other, less abundantly attested varieties of Middle Persian literature include the 'Manichaean Middle Persian' corpus, used for a sizable amount of [[Manichaean]] religious writings, including many theological texts, [[homily|homilies]] and hymns (3rd–9th, possibly 13th century). Even less-well attested are the Middle Persian compositions of [[Nestorian Christians]], evidenced in the [[Pahlavi Psalter]] (7th century); these were used until the beginning of the second millennium in many places in Central Asia, including [[Turfan]] (in present-day China) and even localities in Southern India.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 138. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
==="Pahlavi" literature===
"Pahlavi literature traditionally defines the writings of the Zoroastrians in the Middle Persian language and Book Pahlavi script which were compiled in the 9th and the 10th centuries CE."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cereti|first=C. G.|chapter=Middle Persian literature I: Pahlavi Literature|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/middle-persian-literature-1-pahlavi|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=iranicaonline.org}}, accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary corpus in Middle Persian in [[Book Pahlavi]] consists of:
* translations and commentaries (''[[Zend|zand]]'') of the [[Avesta]].
* other exegetical compositions on religious subjects.
* compositions on non-religious subjects.
These divisions are not mutually exclusive. Several different literary genres are represented in Pahlavi literature.

;''Zand'' texts 
The ''[[Zend|zand]]'' corpus include exegetical glosses, paraphrases, commentaries and translations of the [[Avesta]]'s texts. Although such exegetical commentaries also exist in other languages (including Avestan itself&lt;!-- Boyce, TS 1984, p=4--&gt;), the Middle Persian ''zand'' is the only to survive fully, and is for this reason regarded as 'the' ''zand''.&lt;ref name="BoyceTS"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism|year=1984|publisher=Manchester UP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the notable exception of the [[Yasht|''Yasht''s]], almost all surviving Avestan texts have their Middle Persian ''zand'', which in some manuscripts appear alongside (or interleaved with) the text being glossed. These glosses and commentaries were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the Avestan language texts remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in the Avestan language, which was considered a [[sacred language]].

;Other exegetical works
The corpus of medieval texts of Zoroastrian tradition include around 75 works, of which only a few are well known:
* the ''[[Denkard]]'', "Acts of Religion", is an encyclopedic compendium of Sassanid era beliefs and customs.
* the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', "Original Creation", is an important source of information on Zoroastrian cosmogony.
* Manushchihr's ''[[Dadestan-i Denig|Dadestan i Denig]]'' ("Religious Decisions") and [[Epistles of Manushchihr|''Epistles'']]
* the ''Vichitakiha i Zatsparam'', the "Treatises of Zatsparam", by Manushchihr's brother Zatsparam. 
* the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Arda-Viraf Namag]]'' relates the dream-journey of a devout Zoroastrian (the 'Viraf' of the story) through the next world.
* the ''[[Menog-i Khrad|Daedestan i Menog-i Khrad]]'', "Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom", is an ''andarz'' text (a class of Iranian [[wisdom literature]]) in which a figure named Danag (lit: "wise, knowing") participates in a question-and-answer dialog with Menog-i Khrad, the Spirit of Wisdom.
* the ''[[Jamasp Namag]]'', "Book of Jamaspi", also known as the ''Ayadgar i Jamaspig'' "(In) Memoriam of Jamasp", is a compendium of essential doctrine, together with basic myth, legend, history, and some pseudo-prophetic matters cast as a series of revelations by Jamasp through the model of a question-and-answer dialog with [[Vishtaspa|Vishtasp]].
* the ''[[Zand-i Wahman yasn]]'' is another pseudo-prophetic text, in this case cast as a question-and-answer dialog between Zoroaster and Ahura Mazda, in which the latter gives his prophet the ability to see into the future.
* the ''[[Shikand-gumanic Vichar]]'', a partly apologetic and partly polemic review of other religions.
* the ''[[Shayast ne-shayast]]'', "(on what is) Proper and Improper", a compilation of miscellaneous laws and customs regarding sin and impurity, with other memoranda about ceremonies and religious subjects in general.

;Secular compositions
A manuscript known as the "miscellaneous codex" or ''MK'' (after Mihraban Kaykhusrow, the Indian Zoroastrian copyist who created it), dated to 1322 but containing older material, is the only surviving source of several secular Middle Persian works from the Sassanian period. Among the texts included in the unique ''MK'' are:
* the ''[[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]]'' is a hagiography of [[Ardashir I]], the founder of the Sassanid dynasty
* the ''Ayadgar i Zareran'', the "Memorial or Zarer", is the only surviving specimen of Iranian epic poetry composed in Middle Persian.
* the ''[[Sahrestaniha i Eransahr|Shahrestaniha i Eranshahr]]'', is a catalogue of the four regions of the Sassanid empire with mythical and/or historical stories related to their founding.
* several ''andarz'' texts, the Iranian type of [[wisdom literature]] containing advice and injunctions for proper behavior. 
* the ''Wizarishn i Chatrang'', "Explanation of Chess", also known as the ''Chatrang Namag'', is a humorous story of how an Indian king sent a game of chess to the Sassanid court to test Iranian wits, in response to which a priest invented backgammon to challenge the Indian king.
* the ''[[Drakht-i Asurig|Drakht i Asurig]]'', "the Assyrian tree", is an originally Parthian poem recast into Book Pahlavi but retaining many Parthian phrases and idioms.
* the ''Abdih ud Sahigih i Sagistan'' is a description of the "Wonders and Remarkable Features of Sistan".
* the ''Khusraw va Redag'', "Khusraw and the Page", is an account of a conversation between the king and a young boy who would like to be a page. This work is a source of information on the sensual delights of the Sassanian court.

Especially important to cultural and law historians is the ''Madayan i Hazar Dadestan'', "Book of a Thousand Judgements", a 7th-century compilation of actual and hypothetical case histories collected from Sassanian court records and transcripts. Only a single manuscript of this unique text survives.

Scribes also created several glossaries for translating foreign languages. Of these, two have survived:
* ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', a glossary of common [[Heterogram (literature)|Aramaic heterograms]] (''[[huzvarishn]]'') used in written Middle Persian. 
* ''[[Frahang-i Oim-evak]]'', a dictionary of [[Avestan]] words and phrases.

Several other works, now lost, are known of from references to them in other languages. Works of this group include: 
* in about the 5th century, priests attached to the Sassanid court began to compile an immense chronicle, the ''Khwaday Namag'' ("Book of Kings"), a legendary genealogy of the Sassanid kings in which the Sassanians were dynastically linked to [[Vishtaspa]],&lt;ref name="BoyceTS" /&gt; i.e. Zoroaster's patron and the legendary founder of the mythological [[Kayanian dynasty]]. The original Middle Persian version of the chronicle has been lost, and the contents survive only through Arabic translations and in a versified New Persian version, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' by Firdausi, finished around 1000 CE.&lt;ref name="BoyceTS" /&gt;
* the ''Kalile va Demne'', a Middle Persian translation of the Indian [[Panchatantra]]. The Middle Persian work survives only as a translation into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and two centuries later into Arabic by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Muqaffa]].
* the ''[[Letter of Tansar]]'', a rationale for Ardashir's seizure of the throne. The letter was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Muqaffa]], and from Arabic into [[New Persian]] in the 13th century ''History of Tabaristan'' by Ibn Isfandiar.
* the ''Ayyatkar-i Anushirvan'', which has survived as an Arabic translation in a section of [[Ebn Meskavayh]]'s ''Tajarib al-Umam''.

'''Modern Kannada literature''' refers to the body of literature written in the [[Kannada language]], a language spoken mainly in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]. The [[Kannada script]] is the writing system used in Kannada literature. In the last forty years, eight modern Kannada authors have been awarded the [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith award]], a prestigious private literary award in India.&lt;ref name="jnanpith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|title=Awardees detail for the Jnanpith Award|work=Official website of Bharatiya Jnanpith|publisher=Bharatiya Jnanpith|accessdate=2008-02-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], the second-highest award for literature granted by the [[Government of India]], has been conferred upon Kannada writers fifty times.&lt;ref name="sahitya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm#kannada|author=|title=Sahitya Akademi Awards 1955-2005|work=Sahitya Akademi|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Photodisc (India) Pvt.

==Dawn of modern literature==

===1800–1900===
[[File:Kittel, Ferdinand (1832-1903).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Ferdinand Kittel (1832–1903), Christian missionary and Kannada writer.]]
The nascent beginnings of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century under the stewardship of Maharaja [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]], the ruler of the [[princely state]] of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], and court poets who attempted to steer away from the ancient ''champu'' form of prose and popularize prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's ''Mudramanjusha'' ("Seal Casket", 1823) can be considered the first modern novel, anterior to English influence on Kannada. Though inspired by Vishakhadatta's Sanskrit original ''Mudrarakshasa'', the work displays a creativity of its own.&lt;ref name="mudra"&gt;Murthy in George K.M(1992), p 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;

The impetus to modern literature came from a Western-style education and the Christian missionaries who relied on the local language to propagate the gospel. The arrival of the printing press was a catalyst to this process. Among the several early Kannada publications, the first Kannada-English dictionary by [[Ferdinand Kittel]] (1894) is noteworthy.&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 280&lt;/ref&gt; B. L. Rice edited and published ancient Kannada classics and compiled a brief history of Kannada literature, while J. H. Fleet compiled a collection of folk ballads including the well-known ''[[Sangolli Rayanna|Sangoli Rayana]] Dange'' ("The Revolt of Sangolli Raya"). The most outstanding lyrical poet of this period, whose poems were reminiscent of the medieval mystic Kannada poetry, was Sisunala Sharief.&lt;ref name="sisunala"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 19th century, progress towards original works in prose narratives initially gained momentum through translations from Sanskrit, English (''Yatrikana Sanchara'' from "The Pilgrims Progress", 1847), Marathi (''Yamuna Paryatana'') and Bengali languages (''Durgesanandini''). Early dramatic literatures were translations from Sanskrit (''Shakuntala'', 1869) and English (''Macbeth'', ''King Lear'' and ''Romeo and Juliet'').&lt;ref name="durgesh"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BMSrikantiah.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Father of modern Kannada literature, B. M. Srikantaiah (1881 – 1946).]] --&gt;
With the standardization of modern prose, the earliest original social fictions were ''Suryakantha'' by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and ''Indira Bai'' by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899). With the theme being reform, the latter work critically examines social issues, reflecting an awakening.&lt;ref name="Bai"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoary"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 281&lt;/ref&gt; Original plays carrying the same theme include, among others, the ''Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana'' by Suri Venkataramana Sastri (1887). Nanadalike Lakshminarayana ('Muddanna') wrote two important prose pieces; ''Adbhuta Ramayana'' (1895) and ''Ramaswamedham'' (1898). What makes the latter writing historically important is that the epic Ramayana is looked at from a modern sensibility with the author as the narrator and his wife as the listener, the narration being interrupted at various stages with humorous exchanges between the couple, resulting from questions raised by the listener.&lt;ref name="padyam"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 170&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from the age of verse to prose may be summed up with Muddanna's proclamation "poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart" ("Padyam Vadyam, Gadyam Hridyam").&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;

With the turn of the 20th century, [[B. M. Srikantaiah]] ('B. M. Sri'), regarded by some as the "Father of modern Kannada literature",&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp 1077-78&lt;/ref&gt; gave the call for writing originals in modern Kannada, emancipating the language from ancient courtly classics and stressing the need for the influence of English literature. This period can be considered a seed time, for a golden age to come. His adaptation of lyrics from English were effective, the best known among his works being the ''English Geethagalu'' ("English Songs"), a seminal work that set the trend for "Navodaya" (new birth) Kannada poetry to come.&lt;ref name="geeta"&gt;Murthi (1992), p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable poets who were able to evolve new metrics out of old ones were [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]] in his poem of love and tragedy, the ''Madalingana Kanive'' ("Madalinga's Valley", 1924) and [[Govinda Pai]] in the ''Kavitavatara'' (1916).&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt;

Though Panje Manjesh Rao (1900) is considered a pioneer in the field of short stories, it is Masti Venkatesh Iyengar who is credited for laying the foundation for a generation of short-story tellers with his ''Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu'' ("A few Short Stories", 1920) and ''Sanna Kathegalu'' ("Short Stories", 1924).&lt;ref name="short"&gt;Murthi (1992), p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of modern drama was pioneered by [[T. P. Kailasam]], a towering personality in the field, with his ''Tollu Gatti'' ("The Hollow and the Solid", 1918). In contrast to the earlier ''Indira Bai'' (1899), this work examines the modern education system from a [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhian]] viewpoint. Kailasam followed this with ''Tali Kattoke Cooline'' ("Wages for tying the [[Mangalsutra]]"), a story that criticizes the [[dowry]] system in marriage.&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt; Kailasam's plays were mainly concerned with problems effecting middle class Brahmin families; the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women. He represented for the first time in Kannada theatre, a spokesperson for liberal values and is thus considered by some as the one who laid the foundation of amateur Kannada theatre.&lt;ref name="amateur"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1077&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing the earlier historicals written in English by B. L. Rice, J. H. Fleet, Robert Sewell and Bhandarkar, Alur Ventaka Rao wrote the novel ''Karnataka Ghatavaibhava'' (1917). The work was intended to re-kindle pride among [[Kannadiga]]s about their glorious past and bring awareness about the great rulers, poets and saints who had originated from Karnataka, its traditions and its heritage in arts and architecture.&lt;ref name="hoary" /&gt;

===1925–1950===

====Navodaya====
The Navodaya period saw the rise of acclaimed [[lyricist]]s who combined mystic poetry of the ''Vachanas'' and ''Kirthanas'' of medieval times and the native folk songs of oral traditions with influences from modern English romantics. Best known among them are [[D. R. Bendre]], [[Gopalakrishna Adiga]], K. V. Puttappa ([[Kuvempu]]), [[Shivarama Karanth]], [[V. K. Gokak]], Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, [[D. V. Gundappa]] ('DVG'), [[P. T. Narasimhachar]], M. V. Seetharamiah, G. P. Rajaratnam, [[K. S. Narasimhaswamy]] and [[Adya Rangacharya]] ('Sri Ranga') and [[Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar]].&lt;ref name="nara"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 173-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Bendre is perhaps the most outstanding of modern Kannada lyricists, authoring a collection of 27 poems, including such masterpieces as ''Gari'' ("Wing", 1932), ''Nadaleela'' (1938) and ''Sakhigeetha'' (1940). His poems had a transcendental quality about them which were neither narrative or dramatic.&lt;ref name="lyrical"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 413&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor. The ''Sakhigeetha'' is an autobiographical poem about his married life and personal experiences.&lt;ref name="sakhigeeta"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 173&lt;/ref&gt; Bendre had sworn that, in his poetry, he would "rather sow stars in Kannada soil than brillian jewels".&lt;ref name="star"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 792&lt;/ref&gt;

The beauty and grandeur of the [[Malnad]] hills strongly influenced Kuvempu, one of Kannada's doyen poets, in his ''Kalki'' (1933) in which the poet describes the life of the agrarian community. He further showed his brilliance in using the blank verse in his masterpiece and ''magnum opus'' that took him nine years to write, the ''Sri Ramayana Darshanam'' (1949) which contains 22,284 lines, divided into 50 [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="kattu"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 174&lt;/ref&gt; This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada epic poetry. While the poem follows the [[Valmiki]] tradition, Kuvempu puts a stamp of originality on it, bringing together the Indian and western epic traditions.

In a departure from the original epic, Lanka ([[Ceylon]]) does not burn in the war nor does [[Sita]] enter the fire alone (called ''[[Agni]] Pravesha''), but rather is followed by Rama. Both however reappear from the fire unscathed giving the mortals a glimpse of their divinity. Not only is Sita's chastity proven, so is Rama's fidelity towards her. Like medieval poet Nagachandra, Kuvempu portrays Ravana as an "evolving soul". He pays homage to all the great poets of the world, including the sage Valmiki, thus placing himself in the tradition of world epic poetry.&lt;ref name="valmiki"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1182&lt;/ref&gt; The work abounds in metaphors and similes and brings home the thought that all living beings will eventually evolve into perfect beings. In the words of a historian, "No one could have imagined that the Kannada language is capable of this complex musical quality, for the first time in this century was Kannada made a language worthy of the gods".&lt;ref name="worthy"&gt;Punekar in Sahity Akademi (1992), p 4160&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Venkatesh Iyengar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Short story writer, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar (1891 – 1986).]] --&gt;
Govinda Pai succeeded in depicting an authentic Christian ambience in the ''Golgotha'' (1931). Considered a unique Christian work in Indian literature, Pai narrates in detail, starting from the Christ being taken to [[Pontius Pilate]] by a hostile group of Jews demanding his death and the events leading to his crucifixion at [[Golgotha]]. The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three [[panegyric]]s in 1947; ''Vaishakhi'', ''Prabhasa'' and ''Dehali'', narrating the last days of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], God [[Krishna]] and [[Gandhi]] respectively.&lt;ref name="vaisakhi"&gt;Das (1995), p 148&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilivindu'' is his first collection of poems. Forty-six in all, they bring out his love for nature, his country and Kannada language while the ''Nandadeepa'', a collection of 37 poems are about devotion to god.&lt;ref name="kattu"/&gt;

The influence of the west inspired a new genre in writing, the ''[[essay]]''. Here, A. N. Murthy Rao's ''Hagaluganasugalu'' ("Day Dreams", 1937) is best known.&lt;ref name="kanasu"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

M. V. Seetharamiah came to limelight during the peak of the Navodaya period and was inspired by such well-known writers as B. M. Srikantaiah and Masti Venkatesh Iyengar. A man of many talents, he was a renowned poet (''Hakki Hadu'' or "Bird Song"), novelist ("Robinson Crusoe"), short story writer (''Maargadharshaka''), painter, musician, literary critic, researcher, dramatist (''Swayamvara'' or "Choice of a Husband"), essayist (''Hidi Hoovu'' or "Handful of flowers") and biographer (''Kavi Ranna'' or "Poet Ranna"). To his credit are twelve collections of poems, ten collections of short stories, nine novels, four collections of essays, and nine plays.&lt;ref name="seetha"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), pp 3902-3903&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Seetharamiah's contributions carry a liberal message of love for his surroundings, nature and mankind. An authority on Kannada grammar and literary history, it is to his credit for researching and establishing that the true author of the 9th century Kannada classic ''Kavirajamarga'' may have been poet Sri Vijaya in the court of King [[Amoghavarsha I]]. He established a research foundation in the name of his mentor, B. M. Srikantaiah ("B. M. Srikantaiah Prathishtana").&lt;ref name="essayist"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 3903&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the closest in comparison to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna is the ''[[Mankuthimmana Kagga]]'' ("Dull Thimma's Rigmarole", 1943) by D. V. Gundappa. A successful [[journalist]], he was known for his command over the Kannada language and its classics, with a knowledge of Sanskrit as well, despite his limited education which was limited to matriculation only. These qualities and experiences were to serve him well as a writer. Attributed to him are 60 writings in just about every genre of modern Kannada with the exception of the novel. His adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' into Kannada is well acclaimed.&lt;ref name="gund"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1057&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, who is known to have been inspired by [[Robert Burns]], K. S. Narasimhaswamy won critical acclaim for ''Mysore Mallige'' ("Mysore Jasmine", 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life.&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 175&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, his poems were more metaphysical and included contemporary events in ''Dominion Janana'' and the ''Samsara Rajyanga''.&lt;ref name="male"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 665&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Shivaramakaranth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Poet, playwright &amp; novelist, Shivarama Karanth (1902 – 1997).]] --&gt;
Eminent poets produced inspiring poetic dramas, B. M. Srikantiah being the trailblazer with his ''Gadayuddha Natakam'' ("The War of Clubs", 1925), a modern version of Ranna's 982 classic and ''Aswaththaman'', a native version of the [[Culture of Greece|Greek]] play ''Ajax'' by Sophocles. This was the beginning of tragic drama in Kannada, and a new way portraying ancient local heroes.&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;

Govinda Pai's ''Hebberalu'' ("Thumb", 1946) dramatizes the story of [[Drona]] and [[Ekalavya]], characters from the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="bliss"/&gt; Kailasam and his worthy contemporary, A. N. Swamy Venkatadri Iyer ('Samsa') continued to produce fine dramas. Samsa is credited with writing twenty-three plays, of which only six have survived. Of these, a [[trilogy]] on the Mysore King Ranadhira Kanteerava are well known; ''Vigada Vikramarya'' ("The Wicked Vikramarya", 1928), ''Vijayanarasimha'' (1936) and ''Mantrashakti'' in (1938).&lt;ref name="mantra"/&gt;

Sri Ranga was a dominating and complete authority as a playwright, though he has penned poems and novels as well. In a period of forty years, he authored more than 40 full-length plays and more than 100 one-act plays. His plays, filled with wit and satire, are divided over two periods, the first between 1930 and 1952 where they mostly concerned with social issues.&lt;ref name="dharwad"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 89&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote on Gandhian values and the decadence caused by the caste system in his ''Harijanwara'' ("The [[Harijan]] week", 1934), the ''Sandhyakala'' (1939) and the ''Sokachakra'' (1952).&lt;ref name="mantra"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The wit and satire in Kailasam's language, Kannada laced with English, and the social reformer in him are best exemplified in his plays ''Bahishkara'' (1929) which focusses on religious practices, and ''Soole'' ("Prostitute", 1945), which dwells on social problems.&lt;ref name="mantra"/&gt;

The 1930s saw the rise of another major figure in Kannada literature, Shivarama Karanth, who debuted in play ''Garbhagudi'' ("Sanctum", 1932), which decries the exploitation of society in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="karanth"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 177&lt;/ref&gt; A series of successful novels were written by him in this period, best known among which are ''Chomana Dudi'' ("Choma's Toil", 1933) which describes the plight of a harijan in Indian society and ''Marali Mannige'' ("Back to the Soil", 1942), a story about rural life on the west coast centred on a family's evolution over three generations, during a time of change brought about by westernization. Kuvempu's well accepted ''Kanur Subbamma Heggadithi'' ("Subbamma Heggadithi of Kanur", 1936) is about an educated protagonist in a conservative society.&lt;ref name="compatible"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 178&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:VKGokak.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Poet, playwright &amp; novelist, V. K. Gokak (1909 – 1992).]] --&gt;
V. K. Gokak, who was educated in [[Oxford]], established himself as an important contributor to poetics, criticism, drama and the novel in Kannada, with no less than 55 books to his credit. In addition, he was a distinguished critic of Indo-English literature. His other interests included culture, religion, philosophy and education. His first novel, ''Ijjodu'' ("Misalliance", 1935) dwells on marital problems caused by sexual incompatibility.&lt;ref name="compatible" /&gt; His short stay in England helped confirm his love for his native country and language, resulting in the generation of ''Samudragitegalu'' ("Sea songs", 1940) and ''Samudradacheyinda'' ("From Beyond the Seas", 1940), the latter being a travelogue on his experiences there. His real epic, ''Bharata Sindhu Rashmi'' runs into 35,000 lines with the introduction in English.&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1437&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti Venkatesh Iyengar continued to dominate in short stories with such classics as ''Kakana Kote'' ("Kaka's Fort", 1938), a novel that remained obscure for some time. Set in a tribal atmosphere, the story brings out the life of a tiny hamlet which eventually merges with a feudal chiefdom. Masti's description of their life, love and society is authentic and natural.&lt;ref name="tribals"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1078&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether P. T. Narasimhachar wrote an essay, a play or a poem, the poet in him was always evident. He has three collection of essays to his credit; ''Rathasaprami'' (1935), ''Ecchalumarada Kelage'' (1949) and ''Dhenukapurana'' (1969).&lt;ref name="dhenu"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1220&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable writers of this period were Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar and Ajjampur Sitaram ('Ananda'). Gorur gave up studies to join the freedom struggle at the age of 17 and came under the enduring influence of Mahatma Gandhi whom he knew personally. He was active in the promotion of the "Cottage Industry" at the village level in the erstwhile Mysore state. A marvelous story teller, his first book ''Halliya Chitrgalu'' ("Village Vignettes", 1930) won him many laurels for his keen observation and narration of the beauty of rustic life.&lt;ref name="kanasu"/&gt; He followed this with several stories, describing on one hand the casteism and superstitions of rural communities and on the other the simplicity and charm in these communities. In addition to stories, he has to his credit essays, skits, travelogues and novels. In fact among the first novels ever to be written on the independence struggle was penned by him and is titled ''Merevanige'' ("Procession", 1948).&lt;ref name="mere"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1451&lt;/ref&gt; Ananda's outstanding book, ''Nanu Konda Hudugi'' ("The Girl I Killed") is a tragedy centred on a girl who commits suicide after social disgrace.

Gopalakrishna Adiga describes the joy of political independence in ''Kattuvevu Navu'' ("We Shall Built", 1948), a longing for spiritual values in ''Mohana Murali'' (1944) and the importance of individual freedom in ''Samaja Bhairava''.&lt;ref name="kattu"/&gt;

===1950–1975===

====Late Navodaya====
[[File:S.L.Bhyrappa.jpg|thumb|upright|S.L.Bhyrappa, noted Kannada novelist]]
This period saw the emergence of new trends such as the Navya (modernist) and Pragatishila (progressive) though the legends of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the older Navodaya style. In poetry, D. R. Bendre's ''Naku Tanti'' ("Four Strings", 1964) and Kuvempu's ''Aniketana'' (1964) are well known. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies in the more advanced western cultures in ''Indilla Nale'' (1965).&lt;ref name="shoka"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:KSNa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Romance poet, K. S. Narasimhaswamy (1915 – 2003).]] --&gt;
The Navodaya style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Shivarama Karanth's ''Mookajjiya Kanasugalu'' ("Mookajji's Visions", 1968), where the author explores the origins of mans' faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilization. Kuvempu's ''Malegallali Madumagalu'' ("The Bride of the Hills", 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every strata of society. Being a playwright, Sri Ranga gave a dramatic touch to his ''Purushartha'' (1947) where the entire action is on 15 August 1947, and the protagonist and his three friends reminisce about the past.&lt;ref name="august"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti Ventakesh Iyengar's two classic novels of this era were the ''Channabasavanayaka'' (1950), which describes the overthrow of Bidanur's chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka's coast) by [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] in the late 18th century, and ''Chickavirarajendra'' (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of [[Coorg]] ruled by King Chikka Virarajendra into the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. Masti describes the social, economic, political and cultural situation at that time and the methods used by the British to gain territorial control.&lt;ref name="anasuya"/&gt; The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power, which appears on the scene to restore order, but has its own imperialistic intentions.&lt;ref name="vira"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 689&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti's other important stories are ''Navaratri'' ("Nine Nights") and his epic ''Sri Rama Pattabhishekha'' ("Rama's Coronation", 1972). The latter story begins with the end of the Ramayana war and the return of Rama, Sita and [[Lakshmana]] to Ayodhya. Rama, who is crowned as King of Ayodhya is elevated to the level of a "perfect man", who has overcome extreme difficulties, his personage being described through the viewpoint of several people who have been in close association with him.&lt;ref name="Ahyodhya"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1183&lt;/ref&gt;

A charismatic young writer, [[S. L. Bhyrappa]] made his presence felt from the 1960s with his first novel ''Dharmasri'', though it was his ''Vamsavriksha'' ("Family Tree", 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk.&lt;ref name="bhy"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 429&lt;/ref&gt; His best was yet to come with the ''Grihabhanga'' ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a story of a woman who tries in vain to survive under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. Other important novels are ''Datu'' ("Crossing", 1973) which portrays a harijan who revolts against the caste system,&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 182&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Parva'', a major work in Kannada fiction and an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="fic"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Important women writers of the time were Tirumalamba, the first woman novelist; Anasuya Shankar (popularly known as ''[[Anasuya Shankar|Triveni]]''), who authored the famous novel ''[[Sharapanjara]]'' or "Cage of Arrows"; and [[M. K. Indira]], who offered insight into women's problems.&lt;ref name="anasuya"&gt;Murthy (1992) p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragatishila====
For a short while, a simplistic form of fiction literature called [[Pragatishila]] (progressive), meant for the common man, gained popularity. The earliest writing in this style is ascribed to [[A. N. Krishna Rao]] ('An Ka Ru') who portrayed an idealistic musician in ''Sandhyaraga'' (1935). The best-known writers in this class are Basavaraj Kattimani who celebrated the heroes of the [[Quit India Movement]] in ''Madi Madidavaru'' ("Those Who Did and Died"), the tenacity of a journalist in ''Jwalamuhkiyamele'' ("On the Volcano", 1951), and the rural atmosphere in ''Mannu mattu hennu'' ("Soil and Women"). His ''Mohada Baleyalli'' ("Caught in Passion") describes immorality in religious institutions.&lt;ref name="katti"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. R. Subba Rao]] dropped out of school to join the freedom struggle but later came under the influence of well known journalist S. K. Sharma and the passionate Kannada writer A. N. Krishna Rao. After a short stint as a journalist, Subba Rao took to writing short stories though his talent and consequent popularity was due to his novels. Subba Rao's numerous stories are intense and full of idealism but always with a human face. His early novels, ''Purushavatara'' and ''Munjavininda Munjavu'' concerned the problems of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcaste.&lt;ref name="hoovu"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4185&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of Chitradurga, many of Subba Rao's stories have this region as the backdrop, drawing on its rich history and the heroics of its Palegar chiefs. His later novels show an inclination towards philosophy, in contrast to his earlier atheist beliefs.&lt;ref name="chitra"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4186&lt;/ref&gt; Best known among his novels are ''Masanada Hoovu'' ("Flower from a Cemetery") a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historicals such as ''Durgasthamana'' and ''Hamsa Gite'' ("Swan Song"), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of [[Chitradurga]] by [[Tipu sultan]].&lt;ref name="katti"/&gt;

====Navya====
It was Gokak who gave the call that the Navya (modernist) poetic era had arrived, with his ''Navya kavitegalu'' ("Modern Poems", 1950). With the passing of the Gandhi era and the influences it had upon the minds of people, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived. Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this expression with his ''Nadedu Banda Dari'' ("The Path Traversed", 1952) where he sought inspiration from [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]]. His other famous poems are ''Gondalapura'' ("Pandemonium", 1954), ''Bhoota'' (1959) and others.&lt;ref name="bhoota"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:U R Ananthamurthy.JPG|right|upright|thumb|200px|Novelist and Jnanapith awardee, U. R. Ananthamurthy.]]
Though he belonged to the earlier Navodaya generation in the Gokak mould, [[G. S. Shivarudrappa]] made his mark in the Navya period too. His ''Mumbai Jataka'' ("A Horoscope of Bombay", 1966) takes a closer look at urbanized society in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; A protege of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa gained fame at the peak of the popularity of romantic poems with his ''Samagma'' ("Songs of Equanimity", 1951), poems which are known to have an idealistic bend. He continued to produce more poems in the same vein, such as ''Cheluvu Olavu'' ("Beauty and Truth", 1953) and ''Devashilpa'' ("Divine Sculpture", 1959), though in his later poems a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god's creation is seen.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4031&lt;/ref&gt; As a critic, Shivarudrappa has authored several books, some about Kannada poets and others a comparison of eastern and western cultures, such as ''Vimarsheya Purva Paschima'' (1961), a critique on attitudes; ''Soundarya Samikshe'' (1969), on aesthetic values; and ''Mahakavya Swarupa'' (1971), on the practice of the epic form. His critical essay, ''Anuranana'' (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;
[[File:Girish Karnad Screening Cornell.JPG|thumb|right|Kannada play write and Jnanapith awardee, Girish Karnad]]
K. S. Narasimhaswamy continued to be prominent in this era writing such landmark poems as ''Silalate'' ("The Sculptured Creeper", 1958), ''Tereda Bagilu'' ("The Open Door", 1972), ''Malligeya Male'' ("Jasmine Garland", 1986), ''Idadiru Nanna Ninna Simhasanada Mele'' ("Place me not on your Throne") and ''Gadiyaradangadiya Munde'' ("Before the Clock Shop").&lt;ref name="male" /&gt; Among the most well-known of later generation Navya poets are [[Chandrashekhara Kambar]], Chandrashekar Patil, [[P. Lankesh]], and [[K. S. Nissar Ahmed]].&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 185&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:G Adiga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Modernist poet, Gopalkrishna Adiga (1918 – 1992).]] --&gt;
In the late 1950s, Sri Ranga produced several well-known dramas focussing more on the creator of society (man), in a dramatic style, than on social problems in his ''Kattale Belaku'' ("Darkness and Light", 1959) and ''Kelu Janamejaya'' ("Listen Janamejaya", 1960). In his effort to take his original plays to audiences outside Karnataka, he was helped by theatrical troupes such as the Karnataka Theatre of Bombay, Kannada Amateurs of Dharwad and even well known director-producers such B. V. Karanth.&lt;ref name="dharwad"/&gt;

Other outstanding playwrights from this period are [[Girish Karnad]], P. Lankesh, Chandrashekara Kambar and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad's ''Tughlaq'' (1964) portrays violence created by idealism gone astray.&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th century [[Sultan]] of [[Delhi]], [[Mohammad Tughlaq]] in contrasting styles. On one hand the Sultan is a tyrannical and whimsical ruler, and on the other, an idealist who seeks the best for his subjects.&lt;ref name="tug"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4403&lt;/ref&gt; Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society.

Kambara's ''Jokumaraswamy'' (1973) is perhaps the most popular amateur play in the language. It presents the conflict between a ruthless power and the popular revolt, leading to the death of the protagonist, the soil tiller. Kambara is best known for his insight and his ability to bring the folk element into his plays.&lt;ref name="soil"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1079&lt;/ref&gt; Lankesh's ''Sankranthi'' (1973) brings out the tumultuous events of the late 12th century, during the rise of the Lingayat faith and the struggle of Brahminism in this period. The presentation includes disputations between the saint-poet Basavanna and his patron King Bijalla II.&lt;ref name="saintpoet"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navya novel was launched by Shantinath Desai with his ''Mukti'' (1961) which narrates the protagonist's quest for an independent identity, liberation from his dependence on a friend and his infatuation for the friend's sister.&lt;ref name="saintpoet"/&gt; His second novel, ''Vikshepa'' (1971), tells the story of a village youth from northern Karnataka who attempts to flee from his traditional environment by studying English in Bombay and later flee to England. An English translation was published recently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manyaverlag.de/Vikshepadesai.html ''Shantinath Desai: Vikshepa.''] Translated from the Kannada by Robert Zydenbos. Munich, 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-941196-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Veena Shanteshwar]] brings feminine sensibilities to her novels, notable among them being ''Mullugalu'' ("Throns", 1968) and ''Koneya Dari'' ("The Final Choice", 1972)&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most acclaimed classic in this genre was the ''Samskara'' by [[U.R.Anantha Murthy]] (1965). The novel narrates the search for a new identity and values by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who has sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his [[heresy|heretical]] adversary.&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt; Another notable work is the ''Swarupa'' (1966) by [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]].

In the genre of short stories, writers who are best known are U. R. Anantha Murthy, Yashwant Chittal, P. Lankesh, Ramachandra Sharma, Shantinath Desai, Rajalakshmi Rao and K.Sadashiva. Anantha Murthy's ''Prasne'' (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including ''Ghatashraddha'', which describes from a boy's point of view the tragedy that befalls a young pregnant widow. His collection ''Mouni'' (1973) includes the stories ''Navilugulu'' ("Peacocks") and ''Clip Joint''. In addition, using his strong background in English literature, Anantha Murthy has made useful contributions as a poet, a playwright and most influentially, as a critic in shaping the direction of modern Kannada criticism.&lt;ref name="dari"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

====Navyottara====
From the early 1970s, a change is seen in the output of novels and stories, an anti-Navya reaction by writers, many of whom were themselves Navya writers. This genre, called ''Navyottara'' (post modernist), sought to fulfill a more socially responsible role. Most well known in this form of writing are [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]] and [[Devanur Mahadeva]]. Tejaswi moved away from his initial foray in poetry to writing novels, a move that won him accolades in the form of the "most creative novel of the year" for his ''[[Karvalo]]'' in 1980 and ''Chidambara Rahasya'' in 1985.&lt;ref name="rahasya"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4308&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known short stories are ''Abachurina Post office'' ("The Post Office at Abachur", 1970) narrating the repercussions of setting up a post office at Abachur, ''Kubi mattu Iyala'' which is about a doctor who combats the superstitions of villagers and the ''Tabarana Kathe'' ("Tabara's Story") which decries bureaucracy. Most of his literature is related to nature, conservation and the farmers.&lt;ref name="farmer"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4309&lt;/ref&gt; Mahadeva's ''Marikondavaru'' ("Those who sold themselves") and ''Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi'' ("Murder in the Eastern Region") effectively portray a realistic account of the life of [[dalit]]s.&lt;ref name="dalit"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi''' is one of the [[National Film Awards]] presented annually by the [[Directorate of Film Festivals]], the organisation set up by [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India]].

'''Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor''' (December 1, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and social critic. Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed vulgarities and profanity, as well as [[racial epithets]]. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time.

Pryor's body of work includes the concert movies and recordings: ''[[Live &amp; Smokin'|Richard Pryor: Live &amp; Smokin']]'' (1971), ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'' (1975), ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1979), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982), and ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983). As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), but occasionally in dramas, such as [[Paul Schrader]]'s ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), or action films, such as ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983). He collaborated on many projects with actor [[Gene Wilder]]. Another frequent collaborator was actor/comedian/writer [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]].

Pryor won an [[Emmy Award]] (1973) and five [[Grammy Award]]s (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. The first-ever [[Kennedy Center]] [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] was presented to him in 1998. He was listed at number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |title=Why Chappelle is the man |work=[[Columbia Missourian|Vox Magazine]] |date=September 30, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2016 |quote=Pryor was voted No. 1 in Comedy Central's ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time'' in April. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914220958/http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Born on December 1, 1940 in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor grew up in the brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/richard_the_great_FmHiNQqrDQ08jcRI576TUI |title=Richard the Great |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor (June 7, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1968), was a former boxer and [[Hustling|hustler]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php|website=RichardPryor.com|title= Richard Pryor's official biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gertrude abandoned him when he was ten, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271/ |title=Richard Pryor website |publisher=Richardpryor.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025200/http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271 |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/342/000022276/ |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Steve|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-10-richard-pryor-obit_x.htm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor dies at 65|work=[[USA Today]]|date= December 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expelled from school at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/09/13/a-pryor-love|title=A Pryor Love|author=[[Hilton Als|Als, Hilton]]|date=September 13, 1999|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Peoria, he became a [[Freemason]] at a local lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pryor_r/pryor_r.html |title=Richard Pryor|website= GLBCY|accessdate= October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in [[West Germany]]. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of [[Douglas Sirk]]'s film ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'', Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although not fatally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

==Relationships and children==
Pryor was married seven times to five women:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Patricia Price, whom he married in 1960 and divorced the following year
#Shelley Bonus, whom he married in 1967 and divorced in 1969
#Deborah McGuire, whom he married on September 22, 1977; they divorced the following year.
#Jennifer Lee, whom he married in August 1981. They divorced in October 1982, but later remarried on June 29, 2001, and remained married until Pryor's death.
#Flynn Belaine, whom he married in October 1986. They were divorced in July 1987, but later remarried on April 1, 1990. They divorced again in July 1991.

Pryor also had relationships with actresses [[Pam Grier]] and [[Margot Kidder]].&lt;ref name=Rabin&gt;{{cite news|author=Rabin, Nathan Rabin| url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-margot-kidder,24554/ |title=Random Roles: Margot Kidder (interview)|work=[[The A.V.

== Career ==
===1960s===
[[File:Richard Pryor 1969.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of Pryor for one of his [[Mister Kelly's]] appearances, 1968–1969]]
In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Woody Allen]]. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]] at New York's [[Village Gate]]. Simone recalls Pryor's bout of [[performance anxiety]]:

{{quote|He shook like he had malaria, he was so nervous. I couldn't bear to watch him shiver, so I put my arms around him there in the dark and rocked him like a baby until he calmed down. The next night was the same, and the next, and I rocked him each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Nina Simone|Simone, Nina]] &amp; Cleary, Stephen |date=1991|title=[[I Put a Spell on You (book)|I Put a Spell on You: The Autobiography of Nina Simone]]|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City|pages=70–71|isbn=978-0-679-41068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a [[middlebrow]] comic, with material far less controversial than what was to come. Soon, he began appearing regularly on television [[variety shows]], such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His popularity led to success as a comic in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]'', recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.

In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography ''[[Pryor Convictions]]'' (1995) as an "[[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]". He walked onto the stage at the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas (with [[Dean Martin]] in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, "What the fuck am I doing here!?", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word "[[nigger]]". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the [[Reprise Records|Dove/Reprise]] label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/richard-pryor-personal-life "Richard Pryor-Personal Life"] Retrieved August 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Pryor moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he immersed himself in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and rubbed elbows with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Ishmael Reed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for such television shows as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', and a 1973 [[Lily Tomlin]] special, for which he shared an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Emmy Winner |work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He also appeared in several popular films, including ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972), ''[[The Mack]]'' (1973), ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974), ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), ''[[Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings]]'' (1976), ''[[Which Way Is Up?]]'' (1977), ''[[Greased Lightning]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979).

Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label [[Laff Records]] in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, ''Craps (After Hours)''. Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary ''[[Wattstax]]'' (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of [[race relations]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with [[Stax Records]] in 1973.

When his third, breakthrough album, ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. ''That Nigger's Crazy'' was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=that+nigger's+crazy+RIAA+Gold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgkZ-6WDZs&amp;sig=wxKBEmpo3wnh2-UKdlKRTaWH4a0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB7ITTuYHKAhXE1B4KHYXCDFsQ6AEIJzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=that%20nigger's%20crazy%20RIAA%20Gold&amp;f=false Paul Green, "Richie Sets Multiplantium Record: Boston Has RIAA Top Debut Album," ''Billboard'', November 15, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1975|1975 Grammy Awards]].

During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]], which re-released ''That Nigger's Crazy'', immediately after ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'', his first album with his new label. Like ''That Nigger's Crazy'', the album was a hit with both critics and fans; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.

Pryor's release ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976) continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebasing]] accident), Laff quickly published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as ''Are You Serious?'' for ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''The Wizard of Comedy'' for his appearance in ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), and ''Insane'' for ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Fast Facts |last= |first= |date= |website=Yourdictionary |access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alan Alda Lily Tomlin Richard Pryor 1973.jpg|thumb|180px|Pryor also performed in the [[Lily Tomlin]] specials. He is seen here with Tomlin and [[Alan Alda]] in Tomlin's 1973 special.]]

Pryor co-wrote ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), directed by [[Mel Brooks]] and starring [[Gene Wilder]]. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and Mel Brooks chose [[Cleavon Little]], instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by [[Gregory Hines]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983), before [[Eddie Murphy]] won the part.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the first black person to host the show. Pryor took longtime girlfriend, actress-talk show host Kathrine McKee (sister of [[Lonette McKee]]), with him to New York, and she made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on ''SNL''. He participated in the "word association" skit with [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ginterview.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Richard Pryor: 12/13/75: Racist Word Association Interview |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later do his own variety show,''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'', which premiered on [[NBC]] in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, [[Black president in popular culture (United States)|he portrayed the first black]] President of the United States, spoofed the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverman, David S. |date=2007|title=You Can't Air That: Four Cases of Controversy and Censorship in American Television Programming|location= Syracuse, NY|publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Pryor swore he would never use the word "[[nigger]]" in his stand-up comedy routine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/the-nwordand-richard-pryor.html|title=The N-word and Richard Pryor|date=2005-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JZCS5I80X-8|The word 'Nigger'&amp;nbsp;– Richard Pryor &amp; George Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Richard Pryor (1986) (cropped)-2.jpg|thumb|right|Pryor in February 1986]]
Late in the evening of June 9, 1980, during the making of the film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'', and after days of [[Free base|freebasing]] [[cocaine]], Pryor poured 151-proof [[rum]] all over himself and lit himself on fire. While ablaze, he ran down Parthenia Street from his [[Los Angeles]] home, until being subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at [[Sherman Oaks Hospital]]. His daughter, [[Rain Pryor|Rain]], stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Rain Pryor|date= November 6, 2006|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| page =76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, "What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street."

After his "final performance", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983), which he directed himself. He also wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which revolved around the 1980 freebasing incident.

In 1983, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] for $40&amp;nbsp;million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richard Pryor Ouster of Blacks Criticized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/movies/richard-pryor-ouster-of-blacks-criticized.html |quote=Mr. Pryor announced in May that he had signed a five-year, $40&amp;nbsp;million production deal with Columbia Pictures and promised to open up opportunities for minorities at his Indigo Productions. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date= December 17, 1983 |accessdate=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]] |date=December 10, 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor Dead at 65&amp;nbsp;– Groundbreaking Black U.S. Comedian Richard Pryor Has Died after Almost 20 Years with Multiple Sclerosis |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate= January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Softer, more formulaic films followed, including ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), which earned Pryor $4&amp;nbsp;million; ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Moving (1988 film)|Moving]]'' (1988), and ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which was not a major success.

Despite a reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show on [[CBS]] called ''[[Pryor's Place]]'' (1984). Like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Pryor's Place'' featured a cast of puppets, hanging out and having fun in a surprisingly friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. However, ''Pryor's Place'' frequently dealt with more sobering issues than ''Sesame Street''. It was cancelled shortly after its debut, despite the efforts of famed puppeteers [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] and a theme song by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] of "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" (1984) fame.

Pryor co-hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is also one of only three ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with [[Sam Kinison]] in 1986 and [[Andrew Dice Clay]] in 1990).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger'', co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of ''Stir Crazy'', and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was also accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, the [[craft service]] man handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during ''Stir Crazy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilder |first=Gene |date=2005 |title=Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJgIe5j1bTsC&amp;pg=PA185#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=185–186 |isbn=978-0-312-33706-3 |oclc=475142187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He appeared in ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and [[Redd Foxx]]).

===1990s and 2000s===
In his later years starting in the early to mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated [[mobility scooter]] due to multiple sclerosis (MS, which he said stood for "More Shit").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.

[[Rhino Records]] remastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set ''[[...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)|...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings]]'' (2000).

In early 2000, Pryor appeared in the cold open of ''[[The Norm Show]]'' in the episode entitled "Norm vs. The Boxer". He played an elderly man in a wheelchair who lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Norm Show&amp;nbsp;– Norm vs. the Boxer |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0662160/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire ''Craps'' album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=CD Universe|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6817862/a/evolution%2Frevolution%3A+the+early+years+%281966-1974%29.htm|title=Richard Pryor – Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974) CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor suffered a mild heart attack. He recovered and resumed performing by January the following year. He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php |title=The Official Biography of Richard Pryor |publisher=Indigo, Inc. |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Pryor suffered a second heart attack while in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-23/news/mn-756_1_heart-attack|title=Richard Pryor Suffers a Minor Heart Attack in Australia|last=Writer|first=From a Times Staff|date=1990-03-23|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent triple [[heart bypass]] surgery in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-06-01/news/9106010694_1_richard-pryor-mcelwaine-cracking-jokes|title=Richard Pryor Cracking Jokes After Triple Bypass|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... I have good days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Richard Pryor |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Richard Pryor Hollywood star 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Richard Pryor's star at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], covered with items left by fans]]
On December 10, 2005, nine days after his 65th birthday, Pryor suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife's attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 7:58&amp;nbsp;am [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, "At the end, there was a smile on his face."&lt;ref name="BBCobit" /&gt; He was [[cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were given to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LWtqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT486&amp;lpg=PT486&amp;dq=richard+pryor+cremated#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20pryor%20cremated&amp;f=false|title=Where Are They Buried?: How Did They Die?

== Legacy ==
[[Jerry Seinfeld]] called Pryor "the [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of our profession"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morton, Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/21/morton.thosewelost/index.html |title=Those We Lost|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 11, 2010|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bob Newhart]] heralded Pryor as "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html |work=PBS American Masters |title= Bob Newhart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Chappelle]] said of Pryor, "You know those, like, evolution charts of man?

As [[Bill Cosby]] reportedly once said, "Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Benson |first=Tambay |title=Richard Pryor Retrospective at BAMcinématek, Brooklyn (10 Days, 20 Films, All in 35&amp;nbsp;mm) |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/richard-pryor-retrospective-at-bamcinematek-brooklyn-10-days-20-films-all-in-35mm |work=Indiewire |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
In 1998, Pryor won the first [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] from the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like [[Mark Twain|Twain]], projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, Pryor was voted number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; In a 2005 British poll to find "The Comedian's Comedian", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Pryor was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Pryor to Get Posthumous Grammy Award |date=January 11, 2006 |work=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913185314/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal rights organization [[PETA]] gives out an award in Pryor's name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Artist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it "Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian". It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother. The unveiling was held Sunday, May 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Long effort to honor Peoria-born comedian Richard Pryor culminates in Sunday unveiling |author=Leslie Renken|work= Peoria Journal Star |url=http://m.pjstar.com/article/20150429/NEWS/150428947 |accessdate=May 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrospectives===
In 2002, a television documentary entitled ''The Funny Life of Richard Pryor'' depicted Pryor's life and career.&lt;ref name="explore.bfi.org.uk"&gt;http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b87cb041e&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast in the UK as part of the [[Channel 4]] series ''Kings of Black Comedy'',&lt;ref name="oftv.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.oftv.co.uk/programmes/kings-black-comedy "Kings of Black Comedy"], Oxford Film &amp; Television.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23491363.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was produced, directed and narrated by [[David Upshal]]&lt;ref name="explore.bfi.org.uk" /&gt; and featured rare clips from Pryor's 1960s stand-up appearances and movies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).

A television documentary, ''[[Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet|Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet, #*%$#@]]!!'' (2003) consisted of archival footage of Pryor's performances and testimonials from fellow comedians, including [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Chris Rock]], and [[Wanda Sykes]], on Pryor's influence on comedy.

{{Culture of South Africa}}
'''South African art''' is the [[visual art]] produced by the people inhabiting the territory occupied by the modern country of [[South Africa]]. The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa. The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored [[ochre]] – a form of paint – which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 – 30,000 years. Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. 

The scattered tribes of [[Khoisan]] and [[San people|San]] peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] had their own art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings.&lt;ref name="South African art"&gt;{{cite web|title=South African art|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/arts/art.htm#.Vw5td8d6FlI|website=www.southafrica.info|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were superseded by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]] peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. 

In the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of [[apartheid]]. New forms of art evolved in the mines and [[townships]]: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. In addition to this, there also is the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-influenced [[folk art]] of the [[Afrikaner]] Trek [[Boer]]s and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.

== Paleolithic Rock Art==
[[File:Karoo sandstone with bushmen paintings.jpg|thumb|Sandstone with bushmen rock paintings, [[Karoo System]], ([[Amathole Mountains]], South Africa)]]

The pre-Bantu peoples migrating southwards from around the year 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] were nomadic hunters who favoured caves as dwellings. Before the rise of the Nguni peoples along the east and southern coasts and central areas of Africa these nomadic hunters were widely distributed. It is thought they entered South Africa at least 10 years ago. They have left lots of signs of life, people toilets and rocks ('[[Bushmen|Bushman]]' paintings) depicting hunting, domestic and magic-related art.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleolithic Period|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period|website=Britannica|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a stylistic unity across the region and even with more ancient art in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] region of northern Africa, and also in what is now desert [[Chad]] but was once a lush landscape.

The figures are dynamic and elongate, and the colours (derived probably from earthen and plant pigments and possibly also from insects) combine ochreous red, white, grey, black, and many warm tones ranging from red through to primary yellow. Common subjects include hunting, often depicting with great accuracy large animals which no longer inhabit the same region in the modern era, as well as: warfare among humans, dancing, domestic scenes, multiple images of various animals, including giraffes, antelope of many kinds, and snakes. The last of these works are poignant in their representation of larger, darker people and even of white hunters on horseback, both of whom would supplant the 'Bushman' peoples.
 
Many of the 'dancing' figures are decorated with unusual patterns and may be wearing masks and other festive clothing. Other paintings, depicting patterned quadrilaterals and other symbols, are obscure in their meaning and may be non-representational. Similar symbols are seen in [[shaman]]istic art worldwide. This art form is distributed from Angola in the west to [[Mozambique]] and [[Kenya]], throughout [[Zimbabwe]] and South Africa and throughout [[Botswana]] wherever cave conditions have favoured preservation from the elements.

==Contemporary Art in South Africa==

The [[contemporary art]] scene in South Africa is as diverse and vibrant as the population and cultures in the country. Contemporary artists in South Africa have adopted new media technologies to produce varied and creative bodies of work, as seen in the work of [[Dineo Seshee Bopape]] and CUSS Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams-Wynn|first1=Christopher|last2=McCulloch|first2=Samantha|title=Between the Archive and the Real: Contemporary Digital Art and South Africa|journal=[[Third Text]]|year=2016|issn=0952-8822|doi=10.1080/09528822.2016.1213959|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their art gives insight into the pressing issues of South African society. On a global scale, contemporary South African art is relevant and sought-after. A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist [[William Kentridge]] was sold on auction for R3,5&amp;nbsp;million in London in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary South African Artists|url=http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-contemporary-south-african-artists|publisher=South Africa.net|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art 21, Inc|url=http://www.art21.org/artists/william-kentridge|website=Art 21|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">[[Lowell Liebermann]]’s '''Symphony No. 2, Op. 67''' (1999) is a [[symphony]] for large orchestra and [[SATB]] chorus, with texts adapted from the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].  It is about 40 minutes long, and arranged into four movements to be played without a break.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaston, Karen S. "An Approach to the Critical Evaluation of Settings of the Poetry of Walt Whitman: Lowell Liebermann's ''Symphony No. 2''," page 69.  University of North Texas, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned by Ford Lacy and Cece Smith for the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus’ centennial celebration.  The work was premiered in 2000, with [[Andrew Litton]] conducting the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.  The Second Symphony was very favorably received at its premiere, with TIME describing it as, “Now brazen and glittering, now radiantly visionary...the work of a composer unafraid of grand gestures and openhearted lyricism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39943,00.html?iid=digg_share&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the symphony has since received harsh criticism due to its exceptionally free embrace of [[tonality]] and its distinctly optimistic outlook.  Scott Cantrell in particular has denounced the Second Symphony as "foolhardy" in the "cynical" environment of today.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaston, Karen S. "An Approach to the Critical Evaluation of Settings of the Poetry of Walt Whitman: Lowell Liebermann's ''Symphony No. 2''," pages 112-113.  University of North Texas, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Symphony was recorded in 2000 on the Delos International label with Andrew Litton conducting the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

The Book Thing was incorporated by a board of neighborhood volunteers. The Book Thing is open on weekends and is run by around 30 volunteers.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

On March 2, 2016, a fire broke out in the early morning, which was extinguished by the Baltimore Fire Department. The fire, which was confined to one room of the warehouse, did not destroy all the contents, but ruined approximately one-third of the books stored there; other rooms suffered smoke and soot deposition only. The Book Thing ceased accepting new book donations, but continues to accept monetary donations via their website. Volunteers assisted with cleanup of books both for disposal and for distribution the following Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jessica|title=Volunteers begin cleanup at The Book Thing|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-book-thing-update-20160305-story.html|accessdate=7 March 2016|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a period of cash donations, fundraisers, and new books, the place was reopened in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Hartman |date=November 10, 2017 |title=After fire, locals donate thousands of books to charity in Maryland |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-book-thing-baltimore-locals-donate-thousands-of-books/ |website=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=November 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Town''''' is a 1903 oil painting by [[August Strindberg]]. It is shown at the [[Nationalmuseum]] in [[Stockholm]].

== Strindberg as a painter ==

August Strindberg had no training in art. He painted only in periods, mainly landscapes and seascapes with dramatic waves and skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063602/SWE_280_010.html
|title=The Town
|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-28
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; August Strindberg painted choppy sea in the storm with seething waves, clouds of rebellion and burnings that whips against the rocky shores. His painting method remained personally improvised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/Om-samlingarna1/Hojdpunkter-maleri/Staden/|title=Staden - Nationalmuseum|website=www.nationalmuseum.se|access-date=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805164907/http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/Om-samlingarna1/Hojdpunkter-maleri/Staden/|archivedate=2016-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He painted mostly in periods of crisis, when he had difficulty writing. He did not have a breakthrough as a painter until long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raa.se/publicerat/rapp2009_2.pdf Vad hade de på paletten?: Bruno Liljefors (1860-1939), Georg von Rosen (1843-1923), prins Eugen (1865-1947) och August Strindberg (1849-1912).]&lt;/ref&gt; He has come to be regarded as a pioneer of expressionism as an art form in Sweden. In the 1870s he spent time with several young artists such as [[Carl Larsson]] and others in [[Grez-sur-Loing]] then himself began attempts in painting. He also worked as an art critic. 

== Painting ==
''The Town'' is an oil painting made with a [[palette knife]], with thick layers of paint laid on the canvas. It is a landscape painting, with a town hinted at in the background, reflected in the water's surface. It is dominated by the dark colors of the high sky and clouds, with a [[color scheme]] in white, black and gray.

'''Émile van Marcke''', born Charles Émile van Marcke de Lummen (1827 in [[Sèvres]] &amp;ndash; 1890/91), was a [[French people|French]] cattle painter, born at [[Sèvres]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;Annales archéologiques - Page 277 1833 "lithographies, par Émile Van Marcke, d'après les photographies de L. Robert."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courrier de l'art: Volume 6 Eugène Véron, Paul Leroi - 1886 "A. L'Enclos, épreuve avant la lettre de la lithographie de M. Théophile Chauvel, d'après le tableau de M. Émile Van Marcke "&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied under [[Constant Troyon|Troyon]] at [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]]. He received the cross of the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1872 and a gold medal at the Paris exhibition. He is represented at the [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]] and other museums of [[France]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and in other public and private collections in the [[United States]]. Typical of his work is the public domain image ''Summer Pastoral, Bresle Valley'' on this page reproduced courtesy of the Morton Collection. This gem-like work offers the favorite themes of van Marcke in a microcosm; it incorporates cattle, water, reflections, dramatic [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]s and a feeling of life and motion and verdant nature. Nature is idyllic and animals emblematic of that harmony.
