'''Arthur Fogel''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} is a Canadian music [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]].

==Biography==
Fogel is the [[CEO]] of the Global Touring division of [[Live Nation Entertainment]] and the chairman of its Global Music group.&lt;ref name="LiveNationEntertainmentArthurFogelBio"/&gt; The organization sells almost 50 million tickets to more than 20,000 events every year, and his team has managed four of the top five highest-grossing tours in history, including those by [[U2]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[The Police]].&lt;ref name="TheGlobeandMailFogel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillboardPower100"/&gt;

[[Bono]] of U2 called Fogel "clearly the most important person in the live music world" in a documentary movie titled ''Who the F**k Is Arthur Fogel'',&lt;ref name="ArthurFogelonWTFisAF"/&gt; which was screened at the [[List of festivals in Canada#Film festivals|Canadian Music Week Film Fest]] of 2013.&lt;ref name="CanadianMusicWeekFilmFestDigitalJournal"/&gt;

Fogel spent his childhood and adolescence in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], graduating from [[Ashbury College]].  He later obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Ryerson University]].  Fogel subsequently relocated to Toronto, where he played drums professionally.&lt;ref name=robb&gt;[[Peter Robb (journalist)|Peter Robb]],  [http://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/music/arthur-fogels-year-of-living-famously Arthur Fogel's year of living famously].  Ottawa Citizen, May 19, 2014.  Retrieved 2014-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fogel's involvement in music promotion commenced after meeting promoter [[Dennis Ruffo]] in Ottawa, when Ruffo had booked the [[Margo Davidson|Wells-Davidson Band]], in which Fogel was the drummer.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt; Fogel's rapport with his musician clients is reportedly enhanced by Fogel's own history as a professional musician.&lt;ref name="CMWFF_Itinerary"/&gt;  Fogel first started in the concert and music promotion business at a Toronto club called The Edge.&lt;ref name=fame2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7525560/touring-legend-arthur-fogel-canadian-music-industry-hall-of-fame |title=Touring Legend Arthur Fogel Named to Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame|date= September 27, 2016 |newspaper=Billboard |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, he joined Concert Productions International (CPI) as an executive assistant before being promoted as president of the concert division at CPI in 1986.  In 1995, Fogel became president of The Next Adventure (TNA), a global touring company, and was responsible for the global touring division as the company was acquired first by SFX, then by Clear Channel Communications.&lt;ref name=fame2 /&gt;

As a promoter and tour manager, Fogel has actively responded to setbacks.  In 2000, his team was prompted to cancel [[Diana Ross]]'s [[Return to Love Tour]] mid-stride, reportedly due to a failure of financial negotiations with artists, high ticket prices, and low attendance.&lt;ref name="SupremesCanceled"/&gt;  A 2002 [[Guns N' Roses]] concert tour was reportedly shaken by promoter [[Clear Channel Communications]]'s cancellation of multiple concert dates, due to the band's second failure to appear.  Described by [[MTV News]] as a [[riot]], the event suffered fighting and mayhem amidst the audience, and between the audience and the attending riot police.&lt;ref name="GnRRiotKurtLoder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GnRCanceledMTV"/&gt;

In 2016, Fogel was named to the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=fame2 /&gt;

==Biography==
Toporovsky was born and grew up in [[Rishon LeZion]]. After completing his mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], he studied law at [[Tel Aviv University]]. During his studies, Toporovsky became chairman of the university's student union in 2005, holding the post until 2007. He then entered politics and worked for Minister of Social Affairs, [[Isaac Herzog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/new-kids-in-the-knesset-lapid-s-activists.premium-1.496016 New kids in the Knesset: Lapid’s activists] Haaretz, 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he became chairman of the [[National Union of Israeli Students]], and in the same year founded the Tzabar party, heading its list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]], in which it received only 0.14% of the vote and failed to pass the electoral threshold. However, the party did win seats on [[Tel Aviv]] city council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/yair-lapids-sends-a-diverse-quality-slate-to-knesset/ All the kingmaker’s men, and women] Times of Israel, 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 he became chairman of the [[Issta]] travel agency.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 Knesset elections]] he was placed eighteenth on [[Yesh Atid]]'s list, becoming a Knesset member when the party won 19 seats. He was placed fourteenth on the party's list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechirot20.gov.il/election/Candidates/Pages/OneListCandidates.aspx?LPF=Search&amp;WebId=6adadc15-e476-480b-9746-04490aedeb0f&amp;ListID=ba72a662-765c-45af-9d48-fb68080956af&amp;ItemID=43&amp;FieldID=ListNickname_GxS_Text Yesh Atid list] Central Elections Committee&lt;/ref&gt; losing his seat as the party was reduce to 11 seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8047">A '''bridge bank''' is an institution created by a [[financial regulator|national regulator]] or [[central bank]] to operate a [[bank failure|failed bank]] until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While national laws vary, the bridge bank is usually established by a publicly backed [[deposit insurance]] organisation or [[financial regulator]] and may be instituted to avoid [[systemic risk]] and provide an orderly transition avoiding negative effects such as [[bank run]]s.

Typically, the tasks of a bridge bank are to ensure seamless continuity of banking operations by:
* Assuming the deposits of and honouring the commitments of the failed bank, so that service to retail clients is not disrupted
* Servicing adequately secured existing loans to avoid their premature interruption or termination
* Assuming other existing assets, liabilities or functions of the defunct bank at the discretion of the regulator

These tasks are carried out on a temporary basis (usually for no more than two or three years) to provide time to find a buyer for the bank as a going concern. If the bank cannot be sold as a going concern, its portfolio of assets are liquidated in an orderly fashion. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the national deposit insurance corporation is appointed as the receiver of the bridge bank's assets.

==Operation by country==

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria the ([[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and the [[Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (NDIC) administer the deposits and liabilities of a failed bank. Under the arrangement, the  NDIC is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period until a buyer can be found for its operations.

When in the opinion of CBN, a NDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the CBN and NDIC may establish a bridge bank to;

* Assume the deposits of the closed bank;
* Assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate;
* Purchase such [[asset]]s of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate; and
* Perform any other temporary function which the Deposit Insurance Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act.

Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a [[going concern]], or by liquidating its portfolio of assets, within two years, which can be extended by an additional year.  Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the Governor of the CBN of its intent to dissolve the bridge bank. Under this situation, the NDIC is appointed as the [[Receivership|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.

====Historic example====
On August 5, 2011, Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the operating licenses of three banks including; [[Afribank]], [[Spring Bank]], and [[Bank PHB]], which according to it, did not show enough capacity and ability for [[recapitalization]].

In their place, the CBN through the NDIC established Bridge Banks and transferred the assets and liabilities of the three affected banks to the Bridge Banks as follows;

# [[Mainstreet Bank Limited]] (Afribank),
# [[Keystone Bank Limited]] (Bank PHB), and
# [[Enterprise Bank Limited]] (Spring Bank).

Under the arrangement, MainStreet Bank Limited took over the assets and liabilities of Afribank; Keystone Bank Limited assumed the assets and liabilities of Bank PHB, while Enterprise Bank Limited took over that of Spring Bank.

The Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) immediately acquired from the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), the three Bridge Banks. Accordingly, AMCON injected N679 billion into the Bridge Banks to meet the minimum capital base of N25 billion and the minimum [[capital adequacy ratio]] of 15 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/afribank-co-amcon-acquires-bridge-banks-injects-n679bn/ |title=Afribank &amp; Co: AMCON acquires Bridge Banks, injects N679bn |date=August 7, 2011 |publisher=Vanguard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/bridge-banks-amcon-transfers-ownership-skye-heritage-banks/ |title=Bridge banks: AMCON transfers ownership to Skye, Heritage Banks |date=January 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States law]] of [[banking regulation]], a bridge bank is organized by federal bank regulators to administer the [[bank deposit|deposits]] and liabilities of a [[bank failure|failed bank]].&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;Under the ''Competitive Equality Banking Act'' (CEBA) of 1987, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period of up to three years, until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under CEBA, when a FDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the FDIC "may establish a bridge bank to &amp;mdash;
# assume the deposits of the closed bank;
# assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be  appropriate;
# purchase such assets of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be appropriate; and
# perform any other temporary function which the Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act."&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge banks must be chartered as [[national bank]]s in accordance with [[US banking law]]. To the extent possible, bridge banks are required to honor the commitments of the failed bank to its customers, and not to interrupt or terminate adequately [[Collateral (finance)|secured]] [[loan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(3)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a going concern, or by liquidating its [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of assets, within two years, which can be extended for cause by an additional year. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the [[Comptroller of the Currency]] of its intent to [[dissolution (law)|dissolve]] the bridge bank. Under this situation, the FDIC is appointed as the [[receiver (legal)|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(12)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bridgman–Stockbarger technique''' is named after Harvard physicist [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] (1882-1961) and MIT physicist [[Donald C. Stockbarger]] (1895–1952).  The technique includes two similar but distinct methods primarily used for growing [[boule (crystal)|boules]] (single crystal ingots), but which can be used for solidifying [[polycrystalline]] ingots as well.

The methods involve heating polycrystalline material above its melting point and slowly cooling it from one end of its container, where a [[seed crystal]] is located.  A single crystal of the same crystallographic orientation as the seed material is grown on the seed and is progressively formed along the length of the container. The process can be carried out in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and usually involves a rotating crucible/ampoule to stir the melt.&lt;ref name="ScheelCapper2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hans J. Scheel|author2=Peter Capper|author3=Peter Rudolph|title=Crystal Growth Technology: Semiconductors and Dielectrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq9t9QE0LNwC&amp;pg=PA177|date=25 October 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32593-1|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridgman method is a popular way of producing certain [[semiconductor]] crystals such as [[gallium arsenide]], for which the [[Czochralski process]] is more difficult. The process can reliably produce single crystal ingots, but does not necessarily result in uniform properties through the crystal.&lt;ref name="ScheelCapper2010" /&gt;

[[File:Bridgman-Stockbarger-Technique.svg|400px|Bridgman-Stockbarger Technique]]

The difference between the Bridgman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Percy W.|title=Certain Physical Properties of Single Crystals of Tungsten, Antimony, Bismuth, Tellurium, Cadmium, Zinc, and Tin|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|date=1925|volume=60|issue=6|pages=305–383|doi=10.2307/25130058|jstor=25130058 .}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique and Stockbarger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stockbarger|first1=Donald C.|title=The Production of Large Single Crystals of Lithium Fluoride|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=1936|volume=7|issue=3|pages=133–136|doi=10.1063/1.1752094|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1752094|bibcode = 1936RScI....7..133S }}&lt;/ref&gt; technique is subtle: While both methods utilize a temperature gradient and a moving crucible, the Bridgman technique utilizes the relatively uncontrolled gradient produced at the exit of the furnace; the Stockbarger technique introduces a baffle, or shelf, separating two coupled furnaces with temperatures above and below the freezing point. Stockbarger's modification of the Bridgman technique allows for better control over the temperature gradient at the melt/crystal interface.

When seed crystals are not employed as described above, polycrystalline ingots can be produced from a feedstock consisting of rods, chunks, or any irregularly shaped pieces once they are melted and allowed to re-solidify.  The resultant [[microstructures|microstructure]]  of the ingots so obtained are characteristic of directionally solidified metals and alloys with their aligned grains.

A variant of the technique known as the '''horizontal directional solidification method''' or '''HDSM''' developed by Khachik Bagdasarov starting in the 1960s in the Soviet Union uses a flat-bottomed crucible with short sidewalls rather than an enclosed ampoule, and has been used to grow various large oxide crystals including [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|Yb:YAG]] (a laser host crystal),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arzakantsyan|first1=M.|last2=Ananyan,|first2=N.|last3=Gevorgyan|first3=V.|last4=Chanteloup|first4=J.-C.|title=Growth of large 90 mm diameter Yb:YAG single crystals with Bagdasarov method|journal=Optical Materials Express|date=2012|volume=2|issue=9|pages=1219–1225}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sapphire]] crystals 45&amp;nbsp;cm wide and over 1 meter long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=Matthew|last2=Blockburger|first2=Clark|editor1-last=Zelinski|editor1-first=Brian J.|title=18 x 36 x 1.5 inch sapphire panels for visible and infrared windows|journal=Proc.

'''''Capitalism II''''' ({{zh|s=金融帝国II|t=金融帝國II|p=Jīn Róng Dì Guó II}}) is the [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] sequel to the original ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]''. It was created by [[Enlight Software|Enlight]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] in 2001.

[[File:Capitalism 2.PNG|thumb|left|''Capitalism II'' in-game.]]
The player creates and controls a business empire. This in-depth strategy game covers almost every aspect of business that could be encountered in the real world, including marketing, manufacturing, purchasing, importing and retailing. It has two new campaigns (Capitalist Campaign and Entrepreneur Campaign) plus an in-depth tutorial.

The gameplay is very similar to the original version. One noticeable difference from ''Capitalism'' I is that there are fewer products derived from agricultural resources.

''Capitalism II'' will run on modern versions of Microsoft Windows whereas the previous versions would not.

''Capitalism II'' has also been ported to Mac OS X by [[Virtual Programming]].

A new expanded version of ''Capitalism II'', called ''Capitalism Lab'', was released on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1144#p5117&lt;/ref&gt; ''Capitalism Lab'' has many new features, improvements and a new concept of challenge games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The airline was established on 26 August 1988, and started operations on March 8, 1996. Republic Act No. 7151, which grants franchise to Cebu Air, Inc. was approved on 30 August 1991. Cebu Air, Inc. was subsequently acquired by JG Summit Holdings (owned by [[John Gokongwei]]). Domestic services commenced following market deregulation by the Philippine government. It temporarily ceased operations in February 1998 after being grounded by the government due to an [[Cebu Pacific Flight 387|accident]], but resumed services later the next month following re-certification of its aircraft.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt; It initially started with 24 domestic flights daily among [[Metro Manila]], [[Metro Cebu]] and [[Metro Davao]]. By the end of 2001, its operations had grown to about 80 daily flights to 18 domestic destinations.

In the 2000s (decade), Cebu Pacific was granted rights to operate international flights to the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Guam. International flights were launched on 22 November 2001, with a twice-daily service to Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2001/2001-11-22.html ''Cebu Pacific Flies to Hongkong''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413063101/http://cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2001/2001-11-22.html |date=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2002, it commenced thrice-weekly flights to [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2002/2002-03-02.htm '' Cebu Pacific takes off for Seoul''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415045512/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2002/2002-03-02.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional flights were introduced and suspended later; however, including flights to Singapore (from 6 November 2002, to January 2003) and from Manila via [[Subic Bay International Airport|Subic]] to Seoul (from December 2002) due in part to the effects of the [[SARS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2003/02142003.html|title=Flying between Subic Seoul|publisher=Cebu Pacific|accessdate=31 March 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424032406/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2003/02142003.html|archivedate=24 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline resumed its Manila-to-Singapore flights on August 31, 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/07192006.html ''Flies Manila-Singapore''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413063115/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/07192006.html |date=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched its direct flight from Cebu to Singapore on October 23, 2006, the first low-cost airline to serve the Cebu-Singapore-Cebu sector,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/09052006a.html ''Cebu Pacific Flies direct flight to Singapore from Cebu''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409222805/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/09052006a.html |date=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in direct competition with [[Singapore Airlines]]' subsidiary [[SilkAir]], CEB was the only Philippine carrier serving the Cebu-Singapore-Cebu route for years until [[Philippine Airlines|PAL]] resumed its direct service in 2017. The airline operates direct flights from Cebu to Hong Kong which commenced October 2, 2006, which also made CEB the only Philippine carrier to serve a Cebu-Hong Kong-Cebu route after [[Philippine Airlines|PAL]] terminated its direct service and is now code-sharing with Cathay Pacific for this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/08082006a.html|title=Cebu Pacific Flies from Cebu to Hongkong|accessdate=31 March 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424032411/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/08082006a.html|archivedate=24 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, after a month or two of operating the new direct flights, Cebu Pacific announced that it would increase flight frequency for its Cebu-Hong Kong-Cebu from four to five times weekly and Cebu-Singapore-Cebu flights from four to six weekly effective 25 January 2007. As of January 2008, it operates regional flights to Busan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul-Incheon, Taipei and Bangkok beginning April 6, 2008 from its Cebu hub; and Bangkok, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Macau, Singapore, Taipei, Seoul-Incheon, Shanghai and Xiamen from Manila.

Cebu Pacific's plans to begin international flights from [[Clark International Airport|Clark]] were initially unsuccessful when its request was denied. The nations involved came to an agreement that Cebu Pacific would be only allowed to operate charter flights from Clark to the respective countries' airport(s). Only [[Singapore]] initially agreed to allow Cebu Pacific to fly scheduled flights from Clark to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2007/10222007b.html ''Lack of reciprocal flight privileges keeps Cebu Pacific international flights grounded at Clark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224233017/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2007/10222007b.html |date=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cebu Pacific now operates routes from Clark to Bangkok, Cebu, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/10202006a.html ''Cebu Pacific now flying Cebu – Clark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211180611/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2006/10202006a.html |date=2007-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Cebu Pacific announced an order of up to 14 brand-new [[ATR 72|ATR 72-500]] aircraft, with six firm orders and eight options.

The aircraft was delivered brand-new from the Airbus factory in Toulouse, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cebupacificair.com/about-us/pages/news.aspx?id=1047|title=Cebu Pacific Air – Why everyone flies|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airbus A320 ===
On 2003, Cebu Pacific ordered for 15 A320s to replace the 757 to become an all Airbus customer. Until in 2007, Cebu Pacific adds additional orders up to 7 A320s to expand domestic and international routes.&lt;ref&gt;http://cebupacificairlines.ph/increases-airbus-a320-orders-by-seven/&lt;/ref&gt; The airline added more orders and retired 8 old A320s&lt;ref&gt;https://m.planespotters.net/airline/CEBU-Pacific-Air&lt;/ref&gt; The A320 currently flies to domestic and international destinations in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Micronesia.

=== Airbus A321 ===
On 2016, Cebu Pacific was supposed to receive the first batch of A321neos but agreed to postpone the deliveries while problems of the Pratt and Whitney PW1100G-JM engines that was supposed to power the A321neo. Instead to order 7 A321ceo's to meet ongoing strong growth on its domestic and regional network. The latest contract comes on top of an existing order for 32 A321neo. “With the A321 Cebu Pacific will be able to respond to growing demand with the highest levels of efficiency. Carrying more passengers further, and at lower cost, the A321 is the perfect solution to meet the requirements of airlines worldwide in the middle of the market segment.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2017/06/cebu-pacific-orders-more-a321s.html&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Cebu Air Inc. announced that it was purchasing 30 [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neos]] and seven [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]s for $3.8 billion, allowing it to more than double its fleet by 2021 and expand its international routes. The A320s would be delivered between 2015 and 2021, while the A321neo fleet would arrive from 2017 to 2021. The airline also took 10 additional [[option (aircraft purchasing)|options]] for the Airbus 321neos. Previous outstanding orders for 18 A320s to be delivered through 2014 brought the total Airbus order to 55.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/06/16/358075/cebu-pacific-orders-30-a321neos-firms-seven-a320-options.html "Cebu Pacific orders 30 A321neos, firms seven A320 options"] By Ghim-Lay Yeo, [[FlightGlobal]]. 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first A321 for Cebu Pacific arrived in Manila on March 22, 2018 and currently flying to domestic destinations. Until the 7 A321ceos delivered, the airline to launch the A321 to international destinations.

=== Airbus A330 ===
Before the A320 arrived on 2007, The airline ordered for 6 A330s to power Middle East destinations such as Dubai and primarily sometimes to be used in Cebu and Davao flights and East Asia flights. On 2016, The airline added 2 A330s on its orders to be used in long-haul routes.

'''Cressi''' is one of the largest manufacturers of water sports equipment in the world serving the [[scuba dive]], [[Snorkeling|snorkel]] and [[Human swimming|swim]] industries. The company’s five divisions cover four markets—scuba diving, snorkeling, spearfishing and swimming. Cressi maintains a significant presence in each major economic region around the globe and delivers some 300 distinct products to more than 90 countries. Formerly '''Cressi-Sub''', the Italian company was founded by two brothers, Egidio and Nanni Cressi in 1946 in Genoa, Italy. Still family owned and operated, the company is headed today by Antonio Cressi and its headquarters and manufacturing facilities remain in Genoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cressi History|url=http://cressi.com/company/Company.asp|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cressi name has been associated with diving, especially spearfishing, since the earliest days of the sport. Egidio and Nanni Cressi began producing masks and spearguns by hand in 1938. Their products were made for the emerging spearfishing community along the northern Mediterranean coast. Since then the company has remained an integral part of the diving community and Cressi-sponsored athletes have won 12 world spearfishing titles. Product innovation for scuba divers have also been significant, including the first open-heel adjustable dive fin and the first diving mask with a dedicated nose pocket. Today Cressi is one of only a few companies in the world that manufactures a full line of equipment and accessories for each of its markets.

==Divisions==
'''Swimming'''
Cressi has a long history in the recreational swimming market. It first introduced the Nuoto swim goggles in the 1950s and today offers a full line of nearly 40 products for both recreational and competitive swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cressi Swim|url=http://www.cressiswim.com/company.asp|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable is that in all models Cressi Swim products use professional-grade materials, namely silicone for skirts and seals and shatterproof glass lenses. The company offers two dozen models of swim masks and goggles in a wide range of styles, including several models for children. Other products include a range of accessories such as short fins, hand-held paddles and gloves for training, suits and swim caps.

'''Snorkeling'''
As with eyewear products made for the swimming market, all Cressi diving and snorkel masks incorporate glass lenses and silicone skirts. The company has pioneered a number of design, material and manufacturing innovations for swimfins. These include classic full-foot fins with paddle-style blades as well as unique adjustable, open-heel fins made for use with bare feet. More than 30 masks, fins and snorkels are available and targeted to the snorkeling market.

'''Spearfishing'''
Egidio and Nanni Cressi first founded the Cressi company to service the growing sport of spearfishing, and the Cressi name has been associated with the sport ever since. Cressi-sponsored athletes have won 12 world spearfishing titles in that time and the company offers an extensive line of both spearguns and accessories. These include eight models of pneumatic and band-powered guns, 14 low-volume masks, seven models of freediving fins and a wide range of accessories. In total, the company offers more than 80 spearfishing-specific products, from reels to shafts to camouflage dive suits.

'''Scuba Diving'''
Cressi’s offerings in the scuba diving market include every category of dive equipment. These include masks, fins, snorkels, buoyancy compensators, regulators and accessories. Nearly all of these products are both designed and manufactured at the Cressi facilities in Genova, Italy. Cressi has also expanded its manufacturing capability to include electronics and subsequently introduced the Leonardo computer, the first dive computer fully designed and built by the company.

'''Divesuits'''
Cressi dive wear stands as a separate division within the company and includes more than 30 styles of wetsuits, dive skins and rash guards. These include diving and general watersports styles as well as specialty designs for freedivers and camouflage models for use in spearfishing. As part of this product division, the company also produces a wide range of bags and luggage accessories aimed at the diving and water sports markets.

==Location==
[[File:Sede di Cressi Sub spa.jpg|thumb|Cressi Sub headquarter in Genoa]]

Cressi’s offices and production facilities remain in Genoa, Italy where the company was founded in 1946. This location on the northern shore of the Mediterranean is significant to the company’s historical success and current activities. Historically, the region is the birthplace of modern diving. In the early 20th century, spearfishing began to emerge in its present form and some of the first efforts at crafting masks, fins, spearguns—even mechanical breathing devices—came from the area. Today, a majority of scuba diving’s most prominent brands can trace their roots to this region, and it remains the “Silicon Valley of the diving world.” Practically, Cressi’s location in Genova has also provided it with ready access to the shores of the Mediterranean and allowed the company to maintain a strong tradition of product design and testing that involves evaluations in real world conditions.

==Manufacturing==
Cressi manufacturing facilities in Genoa include more than 16,000 square meters of roofed space and incorporate design and production facilities for each of its product lines. Significant investments in equipment and technology have allowed the company to expand its manufacturing capabilities, with very few of the company’s products manufactured off-site. The company says this helps it maintain tight quality control standards and gives it an edge over competitors that outsource production.

Cressi production facilities include a pair of ANTSI breathing machines used in the development and testing of scuba regulators. It has developed a production technology that allows for the simultaneous molding of up to three materials at once. This has led to the use of multi-material design in dive fins and advances in producing dive and swim masks. Cressi’s expanded electronics manufacturing also gives it the capability to produce a wide range of electrical components and has also resulted in the first completely in-house design and production of a dive computer, the Leonardo.

==Product Innovations==

1943 – Sirena Mask: The first mask offered by the Cressi company, the design remained available for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cressi Product History|url=http://cressi.com/company/History30-40.asp|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1952 – Pinocchio Mask: The first dive mask with a dedicated nose pocket, making it possible for divers to clear water from the mask, and equalize the mask during descent.

1953 – Rondine Fin: Revolutionary features included a tilted blade, strong side reinforcements, and an upper opening for the toes. It was a major advance in both comfort and performance and the basic design elements of the Rondine are still easily recognized in modern dive fins.

1965 – Polaris 4 Regulator: Known for its extreme reliability, this regulator employed a compact piston first stage and chrome brass second stage.

1967 – Pinocchio Vi. Erre (reduced volume) Mask: Introduced a new kind of accentuated V-shape frame. The benefit was greatly reduced internal volume, making the mask more comfortable to wear and much easier to clear when flooded.

1970 – Rondine L long Fin: Extended length blades in the Rondine L were ideal for freediving and spearfishing. These fins were used by Jacques Mayol to set multiple freediving records.

1979 – Rondine Gara: This long freediving fin introduced a new material, nylon, to the fin market and proved to offer better performance.

1983 – Galaxie F1 Regulator: A new high-performance design that used an “injection system” for maximum air delivery during times of high demand.

1988 – Equidive BCD: An innovative jacket-style buoyancy compensator gave divers a more comfortable harness system and improved durability.

2000 – Big Eyes Mask: A new tear-drop lens shape and raked lens position significantly improved field-of-view for divers while also further reducing internal volume for easier clearing.

2004 – Ellipse Regulators: Resulting in multiple new design patents, these regulators benefit from the natural mechanical advantage of a larger diaphragm in the second stage, a fold-out design for easier maintenance, computer designed regulator lever and an internal heat exchanger for use in cold water.

2008 – The Flex-in-the-Sea BCD: First introduced to the European market and now also available in America, this model helped pioneer a new market of lightweight travel BCs.

2009 – Palau SAF and Action Short Fins: Compact fins used for multiple water sports, such as snorkeling and body boarding, these fins incorporated an adjustable, open-heel foot pocket suitable for use with bare feet.

2010 – Air Travel BCD: The first of the extremely compact fold-up buoyancy compensators suitable for carry-on luggage in air travel.

2011 – XS Compact Regulators: Extremely lightweight materials and compact second stage are ideal for travel.

2011 – Crystal Silicone: Used in select mask models, this new material improves upon silicone used for three decades in mask skirts with improved light transmission and much greater resistance to discoloration.

The '''Doctor of Business Administration''' (commonly abbreviated as DBA, DrBA, or BusD and most recently {{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/phdba/|title=PH.DBA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=2018-07-22|dead-url=|access-date=|df=}}) is a [[research doctorate]] awarded on the basis of advanced study and [[research]] in the field of [[business administration]]. The D.B.A. is a [[terminal degree]] in business administration.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127015732/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Ph.D., it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D. in business administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university [[professor]] or [[Postdoctoral researcher | postdoctoral researcher]] in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], which is often represented via the [[English honorific]] "Dr." or the [[post-nominal letters]] "DBA",or "Ph.D.".

D.B.A. candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]], consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinham |first1=S. |last2=Scott |first2=C. |doi=10.1080/03098770020030498 |title=The Experience of Disseminating the Results of Doctoral Research |journal=Journal of Further and Higher Education |volume=25 |pages=45–55 |year=2001 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must [[Thesis defense|defend]] this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024642/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and format==
Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. D.B.A. candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behaviour, economics, finance and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the [[Bologna Process]], the normal duration of doctorate programs like the D.B.A.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where D.B.A. are mentionned into Bologna Process|date=March 2018}} and Ph.D is 4 years of full-time study.

The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, D.B.A programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian Universities. For instance, a D.B.A student cannot embark on the research phase before passing all his or her coursework. Furthermore, upon passing the proposal stage, he or she must clear ethics-related issues with an Ethics Committee. The D.B.A candidate must go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Successful candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee.

==Relationship between D.B.A. and Ph.D==
The Doctor of Business Administration and the Ph.D in Business Administration are equivalent degrees.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the United States. As such, both D.B.A. and Ph.D programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The D.B.A. and Ph.D in Business Administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue Ph.Ds; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases,the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.B.A. emphasizes applied research.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athab"&gt;http://www.mba.athabascau.ca/titanweb/au/webcms.nsf/AllDoc/B432DD075D38015987257076007C6B25?Opendocument Athabasca University: DBA vs PhD&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, graduates of Ph.D programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of D.B.A. programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of D.B.A. and Ph.D programs often become [[Adjunct professors in the United States| adjunct professors]] in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

==Geographic distribution==
D.B.A. programs are offered worldwide. The majority, however, are offered in Europe (42 percent), followed by North America (28 percent) and the Asia-Pacific region (22 percent). 6 percent of the programs are offered in Africa and 2 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

'''Downtown West''' is an official neighborhood in [[Minneapolis]], part of the larger [[Central, Minneapolis|Central community]]. It is the heart of downtown Minneapolis (and Minneapolis as a whole), containing the bulk of high-rise office buildings in the city, and is what comes to mind when most Minneapolitans think of "downtown". Its boundaries are as follows (going in a clockwise direction): 12th Street to the southwest, 3rd Avenue North, Washington Avenue North, and [[Hennepin Avenue]] to the northwest, the [[Mississippi River]] to the northeast, and Portland Avenue, 5th Street South, and 5th Avenue South to the southeast. It is bordered by the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|North Loop]], [[Nicollet Island/East Bank, Minneapolis|Nicollet Island/East Bank]], [[Downtown East, Minneapolis|Downtown East]], [[Elliot Park, Minneapolis|Elliot Park]], and [[Loring Park, Minneapolis|Loring Park]] neighborhoods. Downtown West is home to most of Minneapolis's most notable buildings like the [[Foshay Tower]] and [[IDS Center]]. Being next to the neighborhood [[Loring Park, Minneapolis|Loring Park]] which has a substantial population of gay people, it is unsurprising that Downtown West has a few gay bars such as [[The Saloon, Minneapolis|The Saloon]].

'''Enterprise control''' is the ability to combine control, intelligence and [[process management]] to enable business optimization that is inclusive of business and production operations. It combines the strength of both business processes and production operations processes.  It is the deliberate act of synchronizing [[business strategy]] with operational execution in real-time to enable closed loop [[business control]] across an enterprise.

==Key elements of enterprise control==

* [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)
* [[Supply chain]]
* Environment and [[safety system]]s
* Assets
* People

Interoperating enterprise and industrial [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) provide industrial companies with the potential for problem solutions that cover entire plants and entire industrial enterprises.  This enterprise-wide system can be developed using systems and technologies previously installed. The resulting system, consisting of multiple vendor products acquired over many years working as a single system, is what is referred to as an enterprise control system.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;''Automation Made Easy: Everything You Wanted to Know about Automation-and Need to Ask'' Peter G. Martin, Gregory Hale. {{ISBN|978-1936007066}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''enterprise control strategy''' is built around the premise that manufacturing needs an '''enterprise control system''' to integrate business systems and manufacturing in real-time. The concept of the enterprise control system encompasses everything from sensors and people in manufacturing to the ERP system.

{{quote|This logic does make sense since ERP systems have been refined over a number of years and they create tremendous efficiencies in business operations.   Certainly I and others see the need for this integrated systems approach in manufacturing. This seems to be an elusive concept except at manufacturing companies that have brilliant and industrious staff who assemble custom systems.|&lt;ref name=lydon&gt;Bill Lydon, Automation.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An enterprise control system is the [[open architecture]] framework to integrate control systems with the enterprise while adding functions to improve business performance including MES, optimization, workflow, quality management, and asset management.&lt;ref name=lydon/&gt;

==History==
A [[distributed control system]] gave way to process automation systems which lead the way for the concept of collaborative automation process systems developed by ARC Advisory Group&lt;ref&gt;ARC Advisory Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, enterprise control systems became key terminology in the marketplace.

{{quote|...[I]ndustrial automation interoperates with other functions within the enterprise. Trying to keep up with changing technologies, ... is never easy and the industrial automation environment is no exception. Whether you are a student just starting out or are a top-level executive or manager well-versed in one domain, but have limited knowledge of the industrial automation industry, it’s easy to find yourself adrift in this evolving industry.|&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;}}

ANSI/ISA-95, or [[ISA-95]] as it is more commonly referred, is an international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. This standard has been developed for global manufacturers. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.

==ISA95 “levels” for enterprise integration==
[[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|Purdue Reference Model]], “95” provides a model that end users, integrators and vendors can share in integrating applications at key layers in the enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Control Global Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Level 0''' — The physical process — Defines the actual physical processes.
*'''Level 1''' — Intelligent devices — Sensing and manipulating the physical processes. Process *sensors, analyzers, actuators and related instrumentation.
*'''Level 2''' — Control systems — Supervising, monitoring and controlling the physical processes. Real-time controls and software; [[Distributed Control System|DCS]], [[human-machine interface]] (HMI); supervisory and data acquisition ([[SCADA]]) software.
*'''Level 3''' — Manufacturing operations systems — Managing production work flow to produce the desired products. Batch management; manufacturing execution/operations management systems (MES/MOMS); laboratory, maintenance and plant performance management systems; data historians and related middleware. Time frame: shifts, hours, minutes, seconds.
*'''Level 4''' — [[Business logistics]] systems — Managing the business-related activities of the manufacturing operation. ERP is the primary system; establishes the basic plant production schedule, material use, shipping and inventory levels. Time frame: months, weeks, days, shifts.

'''Exchange Place''' is a district of  [[Downtown Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], United States, that is sometimes referred to as "[[Wall Street West]]" due to the concentration of financial companies that have offices there. The namesake is a square, about 200 feet long, at the foot of Montgomery Street at the [[Hudson River]]. This square was created by landfilling the shore at [[Paulus Hook]], and has been a major transportation hub since the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/E_Pages/Exchange_Place.htm |title= Exchange Place |work=Jersey City Past and Present |publisher=New Jersey City University |first1=Carmela |last1= Karnoutsos |first2= Patrick |last2=Shalhoub |year=2007 |accessdate= 2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high concentration of [[List of tallest buildings in Jersey City|highrise office and residential buildings in the city]] are located in the district radiating from Exchange Place, which since the 1990s has overtaken [[Journal Square]] as [[Hudson County]]'s major business district and become a major business center along the redeveloped waterfronts in the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]]. The Mack-Cali building is host to several nesting sites for [[peregrine falcon]]s. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish &amp; Wildlife, maintains a [http://www.njfishandwildlife.com/peregrinecam/ Jersey City Peregrine Cam] at some of the sites on the building. The [[Hudson River Waterfront Walkway]] crosses Exchange, the other side of which is [[J. Owen Grundy|J. Owen Grundy Park]], extending into the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]].  The [[Katyń Memorial (Jersey City)|Katyń Memorial]] by well-known [[Polish American|Polish-American]] artist [[Andrzej Pitynski]] is the first memorial of its kind to be raised on American soil to honor the dead of the [[Katyn massacre|Katyń Forest massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] | date=June 6, 1991 | last=Stoltzfus | first=Duane | title=Statue Erected as Memorial to Victims of Katyn Massacre}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the south are [[New York Waterway]]'s Paulus Hook Ferry Terminal, and [[30 Hudson Street|Goldman Sachs Tower]], the tallest building in New Jersey. The [[Colgate Clock (New Jersey)|Colgate Clock]], promoted by [[Colgate-Palmolive]] as the largest in the world, faces [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]] in lower Manhattan. The Dic clock, which is {{convert|50|ft|m}} in diameter with a minute hand weighing 2,200 pounds, was erected in 1924 to replace a [[Colgate Clock (Indiana)|smaller one]] that was relocated to a plant in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The New York Times | date=July 9, 1989 | last=Lyons | first=Richard | title=Jersey City Landmark; Now It's Time to Move the Colgate Clock | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/realestate/postings-jersey-city-landmark-now-it-s-time-to-move-the-colgate-clock.html?pagewanted=1 | accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riverfront promenade ends at the [[Morris Canal|Morris Canal Little Basin]], part of [[Liberty State Park]]. To the north is the former warehouse now housing [[Harborside Financial Center]].

== History ==
As early as July 1764&lt;ref&gt;History of the County of Hudson, New Jersey: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, Charles Hardenburg Winfield, pg. 243-246, Kennard &amp; Hay Stationery M'fg and Print. Company, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; a ferry began operating from [[Paulus Hook, Jersey City|Paulus Hook]] to Mesier's dock which was located at the foot of Courtland Street (where [[Cortland Street Ferry Depot]] would be built)&lt;ref&gt;''Railroad Ferries of the Hudson: And Stories of a Deckhand'', by, Raymond J. Baxter, Arthur G. Adams, pg. 64 ,1999, Fordham University Press, 978-0823219544&lt;/ref&gt; and where [[Battery Park City Ferry Terminal]] is located today. The first steam ferry service in [[Port of New York and New Jersey|New York Harbor]] and the world was established in 1812 by [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)]] and [[Robert Fulton]] and traveled between [[Paulus Hook]] and Cortlandt Street in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cudahy, Brian J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cFR56pF1JaUC&amp;pg=PA466 ''Over and Back''] New York: Fordham University Press, 1990. pp.20-24,360,362&lt;/ref&gt;  The ferry dock stood at the head of the important highway to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] (and points west and south) established in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Cunningham, ''Newark''.  Newark: New Jersey Historical Society, 1966.  p84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ferry in turn influenced the location of the terminal of the [[New Jersey Railroad]], which opened in 1838 running from the ferry dock via Newark to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].  The railroad purchased the ferry operation in 1853&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Cudahy, ''Over and Back''. New York: Fordham University Press, 1990.  p59.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1858 built a much-needed larger [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal terminal]].  After acquiring the railroad in 1871, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] replaced the [[Exchange Place (PRR station)|terminal]] in 1876 and yet again in 1888-1892.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Condit, ''The Port of New York''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980.  v1 p46-52,152-168.&lt;/ref&gt;  Passengers could move directly between the trains and ferries without going outside (a similar plan can still be seen today at [[Hoboken Terminal]]).  The railroad referred to the location simply as Jersey City, and if necessary to distinguish it from other railroads' terminals, as the [[Exchange Place (PRR station)|Pennsylvania station]].

It was probably the [[Tram|street railways]], the local transportation in Jersey City, that first needed to identify the location more precisely as Exchange Place.{American railroad Journal Vol 32, June 18, 1859} Beginning with [[horsecar]]s in 1860, the local network connected the ferry with neighborhoods in the city and nearby towns.  An off-street terminal called "Exchange Place" was established in 1891.  It was almost at the water's edge, across the street from the [[Exchange Place (PRR station)|Pennsylvania Railroad terminal]] and with easy access to the ferries.&lt;ref&gt;John Harrington Riley, ''The Newark City Subway Lines''.  1987.  p194.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars with signs reading EXCHANGE PLACE could be seen all over town. In 1901, the privately held land was given to the city by the PRR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Settlement in the Seaboard Litigation; Decision of Daniel S. Lamont as the Arbitrator |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0DE2DE103DEE32A25753C2A9649C946097D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 20, 1901 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company|Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]] opened its tunnels from Exchange Place to New York in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Condit, ''The Port of New York''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980.  v1 p247-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news    | last =    | first =    | coauthors =    | title = 40,000 celebrate new tubes opening   | newspaper = New York Times    | location =   | pages =    | language =    | publisher =    | date = July 20, 1909   | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/07/20/101891053.pdf   | accessdate = 2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significantly, the station was at first called "Pennsylvania Railroad Station", not Exchange Place,&lt;ref&gt;''Official Guide of the Railways''.  January 1910, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1916 the name was expanded to include "Exchange Place".&lt;ref&gt;''Official Guide of the Railways''.  June 1916, p.397.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1926 the H &amp; M station was simply "Exchange Place".&lt;ref&gt;''Official Guide of the Railways''.  February 1926, p.308.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pennsylvania Railroad did not officially give in until some years later, but all the stations, and the neighborhood, were firmly known as Exchange Place by the 1920s.

For many years the location functioned similarly to [[Hudson Place (Hoboken)|Hudson Place]], farther up the Hudson waterfront, as a terminus for the many [[tram|trolley]] lines which crisscrossed [[Hudson County]], as well as for those which traveled farther, from destinations such as the [[Newark Public Service Terminal]], or the [[Paterson Broadway Bus Terminal|Broadway Terminal]] in Paterson.  At one time more than ten lines operated by the [[Public Service Railway]] originated/terminated here. The substitution of rail lines with busses, colloquially known as [[bustitution]], was completed in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;French, Kenneth, ''Images of Rail:'' Railroads of Hoboken and Jersey City, Arcadia Publishing, 2002, p125, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-0966-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferry services were also discontinued in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Cudahy, ''Over and Back''.  New York: Fordham University Press, 1990.  p362.&lt;/ref&gt; and while the Pennsylvania Railroad service dwindled after the opening of [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York in 1910, it did not end until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Condit, ''The Port of New York''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981.  v2 p228.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the end of service on the [[Jersey City Branch]], the remains of the large terminal were demolished, leaving a large open space on the waterfront.  This and the elimination of other railroad passenger and freight yards along the river during the 1960s and 1970s opened up the land that would be used for redevelopment.  The continued use of the name "Exchange Place" was based on the Hudson and Manhattan station ([[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] since 1962) and signs on the bus routes that had replaced the trolleys.

Since 2000, both a trolley service, in the form of the [[Hudson Bergen Light Rail]], and a ferry service, provided by [[NY Waterway]] at the Paulus Hook Hook Ferry Terminal, have been restored. It is also the terminus for several New Jersey Transit and privately operated bus routes.

In management, '''feed forward''' is giving a [[control system|control]] impact in a downlink to a subordinate to a person or an organization from which you are expecting an output. A feed forward is not just a pre-[[feedback]], as a feedback is always based on measuring an output and sending respective feedback. A pre-feedback given without measurement of output may be understood as a confirmation or just an acknowledgment of control command.

However, a feed forward is generally imposed before any willful change in output may occur. All other changes of output determined with feedback may for example result from [[distortion]], [[noise]] or [[attenuation]] It usually involves giving a document for review and giving an [[ex post]] information on that document which you have not already given.

However, social feedback is the response of the supreme hierarch to the subordinate as an acknowledgement of a subordinate's report on output, hence the subordinate's feedback to the supreme.

==Origin of term==

Feedforward as a management term has been used by Avraham Kluger since 2006 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maureenmckenna.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/feedforward-paper-2006-june.pdf |title=Feedforward first, Feedback later |author=Avraham Kluger |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marshall Goldsmith]] in one of his prominent management articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.medicine.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resources/feedforward.pdf |title=Want to Give Feedback?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">'''Fransisco Aupa Indongo''' (born January 15 1936), is a prominent Namibian businessman and former politician. He  owns Continental Enterprises, Indongo Toyota, Frans Indongo Gardens, Farm Gelukwater, Select Service and Gas Station and various shares in mining and fishing companies in Namibia. He is the father-in-law of prominent lawyer Sisa Namandje and prominent banker Wosman Hamukonda. He is third on the list of Namibia's top ten richest people, behind the Pupkewitz and Olthaver &amp; List families.

==Business career==
Indongo opened his first business, which made bricks, in the late 1950s. With the profits from that business, he bought sewing equipment for cloth making, which he sold in [[Oranjemund]]. In 1961, he opened a small shop in [[Omusimboti]], Oshana which eventually allowed him to open a chain of supermarkets across the country. Indongo owns a large number of properties across Namibia, including prominent locations in [[Swakopmund]], [[Tsumeb]], [[Walvis Bay]], [[Otjiwarongo]] and [[Windhoek]] as well as holdings in the sugar and fishing industries.
He is a very well known successful entrepreneur

==Political career==
Indongo entered politics in the 1970s as a leading member of the [[National Democratic Party (Namibia)|National Democratic Party]], which became part of the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] following the completion of the [[Turnhalle Constitutional Conference]] in 1977. At the Turnhalle Conference, Indongo was an important member of the [[Ovamboland]] delegation. He was Minister of Economic Affairs in the Owambo legislative assembly from 1975 and from 1980 a Minister in the Owambo Second Tier Representative Authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=64 Frans Indongo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235133/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=64 |date=2011-07-22 }} at the Namibia Institute for Democracy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he was a founding member of the [[Christian Democratic Action for Social Justice]], led by [[Peter Kalangula]]. He resigned from politics in the late 1980s to manage his business affairs.

==Honours==
In 2001, Indongo received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the [[University of Namibia]]. In 2003, a street was named after him in downtown Windhoek.
Indongo owns Etango Complex in Oshakati, one of the highest standard buildings in northern Namibia.

'''Georges Lambert Casimir Nagelmackers''' (born 24 June 1845 in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]]; deceased 10 August 1905 in [[Villepreux]], [[France]]) was the founder of the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]], the company known for the [[Orient Express]] trains.

== Biography ==
Born into a family of bankers with interests in railways and close links to the court of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], Georges Nagelmackers trained as a civil engineer.&lt;ref name="Tanel. Page 94"&gt;Tanel. Page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he fell in love with an older cousin.  When his feelings were not reciprocated, his family encouraged him to travel to the [[United States of America]] to help him recover and also further his professional studies.  He spent a total of 10 months travelling throughout America during which time he was exposed to train travel on Pullman carriages. He became convinced that there was a market for Pullman type carriages in Europe.  After a proposal to [[George Pullman]] to collaborate on developing the European market was rebuffed Nagelmackers returned to Europe.&lt;ref name="escape industry"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Escape Industry: How Iconic and Innovative Brands Built the Travel Business|author=Mark Tungate|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|date=2017|isbn=9780749473518|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=ACA3DwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of his biography maintain that Georges Nagelmackers knew about sleeping cars as they were already in operation in Belgium before he traveled to the United States, and that he never actually met George Pullman.&lt;ref name="irps history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irps-wl.org.uk/wagon-lits/history/90-george-nagelmackers|title=George Nagelmackers|website=Irps-wl.org.uk|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 he published a proposal to develop sleeper carriages for the European market called "Project d'Installation de wagons-lits sur les chemins de fer du continent" (Project for the installation of sleeping cars on the railways of the Continent). &lt;ref name="Tanel. Page 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irps history"/&gt;  However the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] delayed the granting of a concession from the Belgian government and the establishment of his first sleeper carriage service.

In 1873, Georges Nagelmackers founded the company Georges Nagelmackers &amp; Company, which later became [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]] (CIWL). He headquartered the company in [[Paris]] and created the [[Compagnie Internationale des Grands Hotels]] to develop and operate luxury hotels throughout its trains' routes. His strategy consisted of convincing train operators to attach his sleeping and restaurant cars to their trains to diversify the train travelers' choices. The first CIWL-only train became operational in 1882.&lt;ref name="escape industry"/&gt;

The [[Orient Express]] was launched 4 October 1883.&lt;ref name="escape industry"/&gt;

Later, he bought the [[Mudanya]]-[[Bursa]] line and sold it to the French in 1891. He also bought the [[Izmir]]-[[Kasaba]] Railway in 1893 that he also sold to the French the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign Investment in the Ottoman Empire: International Trade and Relations 1854-1914|publisher=I.B.Tauris|date=2011|author=V.

In [[competition law]], a '''group boycott''' is a type of [[secondary boycott]] in which two or more [[Competition (economics)|competitors]] in a [[relevant market]] refuse to conduct business with a firm unless the firm agrees to cease doing business with an actual or potential competitor of the firms conducting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of [[refusal to deal]], and can be a method of shutting a competitor out of a market, or preventing entry of a new firm into a market.

In the United States, such conduct can be held to violate the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].  Depending upon the nature of the boycott, the courts may either apply the [[rule of reason]], or hold that the boycott is [[illegal per se|illegal ''per se'']].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It may also be considered a form of [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]].

'''Guaranteed minimum income''' ('''GMI'''), also called '''minimum income''', is a system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicincome.org/basic-income/history History of Basic Income], ''Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN)'', retrieved on 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social welfare provision]] that guarantees that all [[citizen]]s or [[family|families]] have an income sufficient to live on, provided they meet certain conditions. Eligibility is typically determined by [[citizenship]], a [[means test]], and either availability for the [[labour market]] or a willingness to perform [[community service]]s. The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]]. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a [[basic income|universal basic income]].

==Elements==
A system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably:

* a calculation of the social minimum, usually below the [[minimum wage]];
* a [[social safety net]], to help citizens or families without sufficient financial means survive at the social minimum. This may be a transfer or, in some cases, a loan, and is generally conditional to availability for work, performance of community services, some kind of [[social contract]], or commitment to a [[Social integration|reintegration]] trajectory;
* [[child support]] by the [[state (polity)|state]];
* [[student loan]] and [[grants]];
* [[state pension]] for the elderly;
* [[disability pension]] for the persons with disability.

==Differences from basic income==
{{Main|Basic income}}

Basic income means the provision of identical payments from a government to all of its citizens. Guaranteed minimum income is a system of payments (possibly only one) by a government to citizens who fail to meet one or more [[means test]]s. While most modern countries have some form of GMI, a basic income is rare.

==Advocates==
The first Muslim [[caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]], introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman, and child ten [[dirhams]] annually; this was later increased to twenty dirhams.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Clark: Pakistan's Zakat and 'Ushr as a Welfare System&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, American revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] advocated a [[citizen's dividend]] to all [[United States]] citizens as compensation for "loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property" (''[[Agrarian Justice]]'', 1795).

French [[Emperor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] echoed Paine's sentiments and commented that 'man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence' (Herold, 1955).

The [[United States|American]] [[economist]] [[Henry George]] advocated for a dividend to be paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= George|first= Henry|date= 1871|title= Our Land and Land Policy, National and State|url= https://archive.org/details/ourlandandlandp00georgoog|location= |publisher= White &amp; Bauer [etc.]|page= 230|isbn= 9781230444703|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Robert Theobald]] published the book ''Free Men and Free Markets'', in which he advocated a ''guaranteed minimum income'' (the origin of the modern version of the phrase).

In 1966, the [[Cloward–Piven strategy]] advocated "overloading" the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by "a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty".

In his final book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (1967), [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King jr., ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{"|I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective—the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.|from the chapter titled "Where We Are Going"}}

In 1968, [[James Tobin]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.&lt;ref&gt;''Economists' Statement on Guaranteed Annual Income'', 1/15/1968-4/18/1969 folder, General Correspondence Series, Papers of John Kenneth Galbraith, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Cited in: Jyotsna Sreenivasan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk5NI69ZO9sC "Poverty and the Government in America: A Historical Encyclopedia."] (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2009), page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard Nixon proposed reforms to the welfare program in 1969, where a minimum income would be paid to poor families. Contrary to popular belief, Nixon was critical of the idea of a guaranteed universal basic income. The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2194|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Reform of the Nation's Welfare System.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] wrote ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'', in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed [[Richard Nixon]]'s Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2191|title=Richard Nixon: Address to the Nation on Domestic Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[New Zealand]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax.  Both were quashed by then Prime Minister [[David Lange]], who sacked Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE133CF937A15751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "New Zealand Is Jolted By a Speedy Decontrol"], Seth Mydans, ''The New York Times'' (24 February 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 "autobiographical dialog", [[classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated: "I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country".&lt;ref&gt;Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue by F. A. Hayek, edited by Stephen Kresge and Leif Wenar (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/182616757/The-Living-Income-Guaranteed-Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingincome.me/wiki/The_Living_Income_Guaranteed_Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal|work=Living Income Guaranteed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published a book "Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises" in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment.  The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism.

Other modern advocates include [[Hans-Werner Sinn]] (Germany), [[Ayşe Buğra]] (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk|title=Green Economics|publisher=GEI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Coyne]] (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/08/a-minimum-income-not-wage-is-a-fairer-way-to-distribute-wealth/ "A minimum income, not wage, is a fairer way to distribute wealth"], Andrew Coyne, ''The Financial Post'' (8 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
{{refimprove section |date=December 2013}}

Tax revenues would fund the majority of any GMI proposal. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs, in order to fund such expenditures. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

Another approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding; However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as [[Modern Monetary Theory]] would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation; This hypothetical [[Chartalism|Chartalist]] approach can be seen in the implementation of [[quantitative easing]] programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollars&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=2pXx Fredgraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Xh0hY3-sM&amp;t=0m8s|title=Ben Bernanke: As a Literal Fact the Fed is not Printing Money|first=|last=wonkmonk|date=12 May 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created without requiring taxes.

==Examples around the world==

===Cyprus===
In July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a {{'}}''Guaranteed Minimum Income''{{'}} for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/07/26/president-announces-guaranteed-minimum-income-for-all-citizens/|title=President announces 'Guaranteed Minimum Income' for all citizens|work=Cyprus Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion]]. In 2009, it was turned into [[Revenu de solidarité active]] (RSA), a new system which aimed at solving the [[poverty trap]] by providing low-wage workers a complementary income; thus encouraging activity.

===United States===

The [[United States]] has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, [[Supplemental Security Income]] ('''SSI''') is a United States government program that provides [[stipend]]s to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] ('''SSD''' or '''SSDI'''), a [[payroll tax]]-funded, [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|federal insurance]] program.  It is managed by the [[Social Security Administration]] and is designed to provide [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]], usually a [[physical disability]].

An early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the&amp;nbsp;[[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]]&amp;nbsp;(AFDC), established by the&amp;nbsp;[[Social Security Act]]. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lurie|first=Irene|date=1997-01-01|title=Temporary Assistance for Needy Families: A Green Light for the States|url=https://academic.oup.com/publius/article/27/2/73/1916654|journal=Publius: The Journal of Federalism|volume=27|issue=2|pages=73–87|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a029915|issn=0048-5950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President&amp;nbsp;[[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]]&amp;nbsp;proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP) which would replace the AFDC. FAP was designed to fix many of the problems that the AFDC suffered from, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee&amp;nbsp;[[George McGovern]]&amp;nbsp;also proposed a minimum income in the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs were implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=David|date=January 1, 1992|title=Long Overdue: The Single Guaranteed Minimum Income Program|url=|journal=University of Detroit Mercy Law Review.|volume= 69|pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In 1996, under President&amp;nbsp;[[Bill Clinton]], the AFDC was replaced with the&amp;nbsp;[[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]]&amp;nbsp;program. This would&amp;nbsp;[[block grant]]&amp;nbsp;funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the&amp;nbsp;[[Earned income tax credit|Earned Income Tax Credit.]]&amp;nbsp;This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the&amp;nbsp;[[welfare trap]]&amp;nbsp;by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelleke|first=Almaz|date=December 2005|title=Basic Income in the United States: Redefining Citizenship in the Liberal State|url=|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume= 63|pages=633–648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President&amp;nbsp;[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wispelaere|first=Jurgen De|date=October 2016|title=Basic Income in Our Time: Improving Political Prospects Through Policy Learning?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/basic-income-in-our-time-improving-political-prospects-through-policy-learning/C69074D813A9FE5096E60718131ACAD6|journal=Journal of Social Policy|volume=45|issue=4|pages=617–634|doi=10.1017/s0047279416000039|issn=0047-2794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;This law is primarily implemented through the&amp;nbsp;[[Bolsa Família]]&amp;nbsp;program. Under this program, poorer families will receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Família is a&amp;nbsp;[[conditional cash transfer]]&amp;nbsp;program, meaning that beneficiaries will receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they will be cut off from aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650663|title=Happy families|date=2008-02-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-30|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil's population, were participating in Bolsa Família.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/brazil/overview#2|title=Overview|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada has experimented with minimum income trials, both in the past and in the present. The most prominent past example is the&amp;nbsp;[[Mincome]]&amp;nbsp;experiment, which ran in&amp;nbsp;[[Manitoba]]&amp;nbsp;in the 1970s. Mincome provided lower income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The researchers conducting Mincome found that it did not disincentivize work. The only recipients who reduced their number of hours worked were single mothers, who could now afford to stay at home and raise their children, and young men who preferred to stay in school rather than work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/2001-odyssee-espace/a-guaranteed-annual-income-from-mincome-to-the-millennium/|title=A guaranteed annual income? From moncome to millennium|work=Policy Options|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Budget shortfalls resulted in the shuttering of the program.

In 2017, the province of&amp;nbsp;[[Ontario]]&amp;nbsp;began an minimum income experiment. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/pf/canada-ontario-money-basic-income-program/index.html|title=Canada: Ontario launches guaranteed income program for 4,000 residents|last=Petroff|first=Alanna|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recipients of this program can receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers are using this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot|title=Ontario Basic Income Pilot|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ontario.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2391">'''Hellmut Röhnisch''', born 1914 in [[Zeitz]] in [[Germany]], died 1996 in [[Örebro]] in [[Sweden]] was a universal language activist, businessman and athlete.
 
Röhnisch went to school in [[Kassel]] in Germany.  He left Germany with a group of countrymen in 1932. Thus escaping being arrested and prosecuted for his engagement in the German trade union movement in a situation where political circumstances were in turmoil. Röhnisch eventually settled in Örebro in Sweden after travelling, mainly by foot, through [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]] and [[Finland]].
 
In 1945 Röhnisch won the first ever Swedish Championship in [[gymnastics]]. Röhnisch was engaged as a judge and interpreter for competitions in gymnastics in all World Championships and Olympic Games until 1988 in [[Seoul]]. For his contributions Röhnisch was awarded an honorary membership of the [[International Gymnastics Federation]] ([[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]]).

In 1945 Röhnisch set up a company specialized in gymnastics apparatus. Eventually the company included sportswear in its offering.  The company, Röhnisch Sportswear, is managed by descendants and is since 2002 specialized in sportswear for women.
As a child Hellmut Rönnisch learnt [[Ido (language)|Ido]] from his father Ewald Röhnisch, a leading figure in the German Ido movement. Hellmut Röhnisch was very active in the Ido movement both internationally and in Sweden and served many years as chairman both in the International Union of Ido (ULI) and the [[Swedish Ido Association]].    

When the Swedish Ido Association was dissolved in 1996 the assets of the association were used to set up the [[Ido-foundation for Language Research in Memory of Hellmut Röhnisch]]. The foundation has since then made important contributions to linguistic science and the universal language movement.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual property''' ('''IP''') is a category of [[property]] that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes other types of rights, such as [[trade secret]]s, [[publicity rights]], [[moral rights]], and rights against [[unfair competition]]. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel1_e.htm |title=What are intellectual property rights? |website=World Trade Organization |publisher=World Trade Organization |access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual property", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005"&gt;"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations." in [[Mark A. Lemley]], [http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf ''Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035349/http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}, Texas Law Review, 2005, Vol. 83:1031, page 1033, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create{{snd}}usually for a limited period of time.  This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}} These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Falvey and Neil Foster (2006): “The Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Technology Transfer and Economic Growth”: Theory and Evidence, In cooperation with Olga Memedovic UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (UNIDO),  available: https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2009-04/Role_of_intellectual_property_rights_in_technology_transfer_and_economic_growth_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is "indivisible" – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]

The [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760–1911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.

The first known use of the term ''intellectual property'' dates to 1769, when a piece published in the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' used the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Monthly Review'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMsvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 41. p. 290] (1769): "What a niggard this Doctor is of his own, and how profuse he is of other people's intellectual property.")&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Medical Repository Of Original Essays And Intelligence'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij9JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 vol. 11. p. 303] (1808): "New-England Association in favour of Inventors and Discoverers, and particularly for the Protection of intellectual Property.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The German equivalent was used with the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] whose [[constitution]] granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (''Schutz des geistigen Eigentums'') to the confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de67-18/verfassung67-i.htm 'Article 4 No. 6 of the Constitution of 1867 (German)'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When the administrative secretariats established by the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] (1883) and the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]].

The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization|treaty]] as an agency of the [[United Nations]]. According to legal scholar [[Mark Lemley]], it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention),&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005" /&gt; and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=582602 "Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding"] (Abstract); see Table 1: 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal [[right]] obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Mossoff, A. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=863925 'Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550–1800,'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term can be found used in an October 1845 [[Massachusetts Circuit Court]] ruling in the patent case ''Davoll et al. v. Brown.'', in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that "only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears."&lt;ref&gt;''1 Woodb. &amp; M. 53, 3 West.L.J. 151, 7 F.Cas. 197, No. 3662, 2 Robb.Pat.Cas. 303, Merw.Pat.Inv. 414''&lt;/ref&gt; The statement that "discoveries are..property" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the [[French law of 1791]] stated, "All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |title=Patent Archives – Ladas &amp; Parry LLP |publisher=Ladas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115040700/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[France|French]] author A. Nion mentioned ''propriété intellectuelle'' in his ''Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs'', published in 1846.

Until recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope.&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr83&amp;div=30&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |title=Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding |author=Mark A. Lemley |publisher=Heinonline.org |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist; (October 20th 2005): “The Liquidity of Innovation”; How the new market for intellectual property is changing the technology industry, available; https://www.economist.com/node/5015365&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. [[Jewish law]] includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/copyright1.html |title=Jewish Law – Articles ("Jewish Law and Copyright") |publisher=Jlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of [[Sybaris]] offered one year's patent "to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, A Classical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, and Intended to Elucidate All the Important Points Connected with the Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, and Fine Arts of the Greek and Romans. Together with an Account of Coins, Weights, and Measures, with Tabular Values of the Same 1273 (Harper &amp; Brothers 1841). See also "The first patent law was enacted in Sybaris, a city in the South of Italy, before the Roman domination; (…) The law was mentioned by Atheneus, an ancient writer..." in Takenaka, Toshiko (2013). Intellectual Property in Common Law and Civil Law. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 419. (chapter by Mario Franzosi).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jean-Frédéric Morin, "the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that "the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries." Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roisah|first=Kholis|date=2017-12-26|title=Understanding Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement: From Hard and Soft Law Perspective|url=http://pasca.unhas.ac.id/ojs/index.php/halrev/article/view/1153|journal=Hasanuddin Law Review|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–289|doi=10.20956/halrev.v3i3.1153|issn=2442-9899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.&lt;ref&gt;WTO (2013): Intellectual Property; Responding to least developed countries’ special needs in intellectual property; https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ldc_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property rights==
Intellectual property rights include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[industrial design right]]s, [[trademark]]s, [[plant variety rights]], [[trade dress]], [[geographical indications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514 Article 1(2) of the Paris Convention]: "The protection of industrial property has as its object patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, indications of source or appellations of origin, and the repression of unfair competition."&lt;/ref&gt; and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of ''[[sui generis]]'' exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called [[mask work]] rights in the US) and [[supplementary protection certificate]]s for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and [[database rights]] (in [[EC law|European law]]). The term "industrial property" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/index.html|title=Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===
{{Main|Patent}}
A [[patent]] is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an [[invention]] for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability.&lt;ref name="WIPO Handbook Ch 2"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.

===Copyright===
{{Main|Copyright}}
A [[copyright]] gives the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works".&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights] |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF |author=World Intellectual Property Organisation |title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=August 2008 |page=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66HD0x4jV?url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Art and copyright] |pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial design rights===
{{Main|Industrial design right}}
An [[industrial design right]] (sometimes called "design right" or ''design patent'') protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.&lt;ref name="wipo.int"/&gt;

===Plant varieties===
{{Main|Plant breeders' rights}}
[[Plant breeders' rights]] or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.

===Trademarks===
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a recognizable [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], [[design]] or [[expression (language)|expression]] which distinguishes [[Good (economics)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp |title=Trademark, Patent, or Copyright? |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm |title=A trade mark is a sign which can distinguish your goods and services from those of your competitors (you may refer to your trade mark as your "brand"). |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentamt.de/english/trade_marks/index.html |title=Trade marks identify the goods and services of particular traders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade dress===
{{Main|Trade dress}}
[[Trade dress]] is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade secrets===
{{Main|Trade secret}}
A [[trade secret]] is a [[formula]], practice, process, [[design]], instrument, [[pattern]], or compilation of [[information]] which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)

==Object of intellectual property law==
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be "absolute protection". "If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions".&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley" /&gt; This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of "real" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]], stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farah |first1=Paolo Davide |last2=Tremolada |first2=Riccardo |title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Transnational Dispute Management |date=March 15, 2014 |volume=11 |issue=2 |ssrn=2472339 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

===Financial incentive===
These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated [[research and development]] costs.&lt;ref name="MonoProf"&gt;[http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/school_of_health/research_projects/files/health_innova_IPR_reform_report.pdf Prudential Reasons for IPR Reform], University of Melbourne, Doris Schroeder and Peter Singer, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; "[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/|website=Stanford University Libraries|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ”Some commentators, such as [[David K. Levine|David Levine]] and [[Michele Boldrin]], dispute this justification.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=David |authorlink=David K. Levine |author2=Michele Boldrin |author2link=Michele Boldrin |title=Against intellectual monopoly |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2008-09-07 |location= |url=http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-521-87928-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Chemotherapy That Costs $70,000 in the U.S. Costs $2,500 in India |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/why-chemotherapy-that-costs-70-000-in-the-us-costs-2-500-in-india/274847/ |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author=Thomas Bollyky |date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in [[Pension led funding|pension-led funding]] and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: "There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brassell, King |first=Martin, Kelvin |title=Banking on IP? |year=2013 |publisher=The Intellectual Property Office |location=Newport, Wales |isbn=978-1-908908-86-5 |page=15 |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-bankingip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The ''WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook'' gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch1.pdf p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA) states that "effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132516/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonecon.com/docs/studies/0807_thevalueofip.pdf |format=PDF |title=Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States |author1=Robert J.

Pham |publisher=Sonecon.com |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "IP-intensive industries" are estimated to generate 72 percent more [[value added]] (price minus material cost) per employee than "non-IP-intensive industries".&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Pham"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216195041/http://www.the-value-of-ip.org/ Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States], Robert Shapiro and Nam Pham, July 2007 (archived on archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2009}}&lt;!--does advertising count as "value"--&gt;

A joint research project of the [[WIPO]] and the [[United Nations University]] measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found "a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth."&lt;ref name="WIPO: Economic Impact"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/portal/en/news/2007/article_0032.html Measuring the Economic Impact of IP Systems], WIPO, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality===
According to Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relationship between intellectual property and [[human rights]] is a complex one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – The World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are moral arguments for intellectual property.

The arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/#LocJusIntPro|title=Intellectual Property|last=Moore|first=Adam|date=2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:

# ''Natural Rights/Justice Argument'': this argument is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald V. Bettig. "Critical Perspectives on the History and Philosophy of Copyright" in Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property, by Ronald V. Bettig. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1996), 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.
# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not. Innovation and invention in 19th century America has been attributed to the development of the [[patent]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 416.&lt;/ref&gt; By providing innovators with "durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources", intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility.&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spinello |first=Richard A. |title=Intellectual property rights |journal=Library Hi Tech |date=January 2007 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=12–22 |doi=10.1108/07378830710735821}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 3, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the "creation, production, and distribution of intellectual works".&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007" /&gt; Utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas. Systems of protection such as Intellectual property optimize social utility.
# ''"Personality" Argument'': this argument is based on a quote from [[Hegel]]: "Every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will, that is to say, to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; European intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an "extension of oneself and of one's personality".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and/or altered. Intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality.

[[Lysander Spooner]] (1855) argues "that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases".&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Intellectual Property, Part 1 Chapter 1 Section 9 – Lysander Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Ayn Rand]] argued in her book ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal |location=New York |publisher=Signet |year=1967 |origyear=1966 |edition=paperback 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement, misappropriation, and enforcement==
{{Main|Intellectual property infringement}}

Violation of intellectual property rights, called "infringement" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and "misappropriation" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.

As of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.&lt;ref name=Bitton&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent infringement===
{{Main|Patent infringement|}}

Patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in the [[claim (patent)|claims]] of the granted patent. There is [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pradip K. Sahu and Shannon Mrksich, Ph.D. [http://www.brinkshofer.com/resource_center/85-the-hatch-waxman-act-research-exempt-from-patent-infringement The Hatch-Waxman Act: When Is Research Exempt from Patent Infringement?] ABA-IPL Newsletter 22(4) Summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L.

===Copyright infringement===
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}

Copyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a [[Copyright law#Scope|work]], or to make [[derivative work]]s, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called "piracy".&lt;ref name=Panethiere_p2&gt;{{cite web |last=Panethiere |first=Darrell |title=The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development |publisher=UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin |date=July–September 2005 |page=2 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080816063513/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=Xuan_p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Correa |first=Carlos Maria |author2=Li, Xuan |title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2009 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta |isbn=978-1-84844-663-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa&gt;Irina D.

Examples of such doctrines are the [[fair use]] and [[fair dealing]] doctrine.

===Trademark infringement===
{{Main|Trademark infringement}}

Trademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa /&gt;

===Trade secret misappropriation===
{{Main|Trade secret#Misappropriation}}

Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===The term "intellectual property"===
Criticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike Masnick |authorlink1=Mike Masnick |title=If Intellectual Property Is Neither Intellectual, Nor Property, What Is It? |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |website=techdirt.com |publisher=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813003301/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |archivedate=13 August 2014 |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free Software Foundation]] founder [[Richard Stallman]] argues that, although the term ''intellectual property'' is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it "systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion". He claims that the term "operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues" and that it creates a "bias" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to "property rights".&lt;ref name="mirage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml |title=Did You Say "Intellectual Property"? It's a Seductive Mirage |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2008-03-28 |publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that "to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'."&lt;ref name="words-to-avoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#IntellectualProperty |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2016-12-01 |publisher=The GNU Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, economists [[Michele Boldrin|Boldrin]] and [[David K. Levine|Levine]] prefer to use the term "intellectual monopoly" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Boldrin, Michele, and David K. Levine. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.htm Against intellectual monopoly]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They further argued that “stronger patents do little or nothing to encourage innovation”, mainly explained by its tendency to create market monopolies, thereby restricting further innovations and technology transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine (2009): “Intellectual Property Rights and Economic Growth in the Long-Run”; A model Discovery, available; http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/aea_pp09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |title=copyright and globalization in the age of computer networks |date=19 April 2001 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=mit.edu |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302072256/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and [[case law]] to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that "if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |title=Misinterpreting Copyright |date= |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=gnu.org |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905075652/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |archivedate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor, writer and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]], along with many other [[copyleft]] and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original).&lt;ref name="lessigperpetual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Intellectual property" is a silly euphemism |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is [[artificial scarcity|no natural scarcity]] of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. [[Stephan Kinsella]] has objected to ''intellectual property'' on the grounds that the word "property" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella (2001) [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf Against Intellectual Property] Journal of Libertarian Studies 15(2):1–53&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative terms====
In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as [[intellectual rights]], traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term ''intellectual rights'' has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term ''intellectual property'' has increased.

Alternative terms ''monopolies on information'' and ''intellectual monopoly'' have emerged among those who argue against the "property" or "intellect" or "rights" assumptions, notably [[Richard Stallman]]. The [[backronym]]s ''intellectual protectionism'' and ''intellectual poverty'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella for Ludwig von Mises Institute blog, January 6, 2011. [http://archive.mises.org/15240/intellectual-poverty/ Intellectual Poverty]&lt;/ref&gt; whose initials are also ''IP'', have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym ''[[Opposition to digital rights management|digital restrictions management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drm.info/ Official drm.info site] run by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management |title=What is DRM? |publisher=Defective by Design |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an ''intellectual monopoly privilege'' (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen&lt;ref&gt;Birgitte Andersen.

More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that [[patent thickets]] are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/stallmans-got-company-researcher-wants-nanotech-patent-moratorium/ Stallman's got company: Researcher wants nanotech patent moratorium] – Ars Technica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium Freeze on nanotechnology patents proposed to help grow the sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302113908/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium |date=2014-03-02 }}- Wired UK 11-23-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Petra. 2013. "Patents and Innovation: Evidence from Economic History." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27(1): 23-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of that argument, [[Jörg Baten]], Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Jörg|last2=Bianchi|first2=Nicola|last3=Moser|first3=Petra|title=Compulsory licensing and innovation–Historical evidence from German patents after WWI|journal=Journal of Development Economics|date=2017|volume=126|pages=231–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.

[[Peter Drahos]] notes, "Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite.

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] issued a document called "Human rights and intellectual property" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws.

Further along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug.&lt;ref name=Sonderholm&gt;Jorn Sonderholm (2010) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00358.x/abstract Ethical Issues Surrounding Intellectual Property Rights], Philosophy Compass 5(12): 1107–1115.&lt;/ref&gt; "An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&amp;D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations".&lt;ref name=Sonderholm /&gt;{{rp|1108–9}}

[[Libertarian]]s have [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property|differing views on intellectual property]].{{Fact|date=August 2018}} [[Stephan Kinsella]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] on the [[right-libertarian|right-wing of libertarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella, [http://web.archive.org/web/20180415041048/https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/01/stephan-kinsella/what-it-means-to-be-an-anarcho-capitalist/ "What It Means To Be an Anarcho-Capitalist"], "LewRockwell.com", published 2004-01-20, archived 2018-04-15, accessed 2018-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[criticism of intellectual property|argues against intellectual property]] because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates [[artificial scarcity]] and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy&amp;mdash;let's call him Galt-Magnon&amp;mdash;decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/books/against.pdf N. Stephan Kinsella, ''Against Intellectual property''] (2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his [[candle|taper]] at mine, receives light without darkening me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Thomas Jefferson, ''Letter to Isaac McPherson''] (August 13, 1813)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|RSA]] launched the [[Adelphi Charter]], aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (14 October 2005).

Another aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Bennet|title=Native Americans and Intellectual Property: the Necessity of Implementing Collective Ideals into Current United States Intellectual Property Laws|year= 2009 |ssrn=1498783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property laws===
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years)]]

Other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.

In addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Council for Responsible Genetics, [http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/crg.html DNA Patents Create Monopolies on Living Organisms.] Accessed 2008.12.18.&lt;/ref&gt; (and in the United States, [[Plant breeders' rights|certain living organisms]] have been patentable for over a century).&lt;ref&gt;Plant Patents [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/plant/ USPTO.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wharton, "MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin," Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Fisher III, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html The Growth of Intellectual Property:A History of the Ownership of Ideas in the United States] Eigentumskulturen im Vergleich (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls "piracy". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |author=Brett Smith |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007–2010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.

In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of "trademark", as exemplified by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is "capable of distinguishing" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Beckman and Christa Pletcher (2009) [http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2010/10/article.10.215.pdf Expanding Global Trademark Regulation] Wake Forest Intellectual Property Law Journal 10(2): 215–239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-2018, both the U.S. and the EU Commission simultaneously decided to depart from the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS Project]] timetable, which was set up in 2013 to combat IP BEPS tax tools like the above,&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"&gt;{{cite web|title=BEPS Project Background Brief|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/background-brief-inclusive-framework-for-beps-implementation.pdf|publisher=OECD|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launch their own anti-IP BEPS tax regimes:

The departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS Project process, is attributed to frustrations with the rise in IP as a key BEPS tax tool, creating intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or [[capital allowance]] BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles).  In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower-income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Commission's [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|€13 billion fine]] of Apple's pre 2015 double Irish IP BEPS tax scheme, is the largest corporate tax fine in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4472500/apple-eu-irish-tax-bill/|title=Apple vs. the E.U.

Jocelyn Chng, a [[Singaporeans|Singaporean]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], is the managing director of Sin Hwa Dee Food Stuff industries Pte Ltd and JR Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Channel NewsAsia|title=Millionaire Mind Minute with Jocelyn Chng|date=2017-01-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGe_9qDQ65E|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
The parents of Jocelyn Chng lost their jobs when the food factory they were working for shut down. To make a living, her parents sold sauces made in their backyard to roadside food hawkers. By the 1970s, Sin Hwa Dee grew swiftly and had its own factory. It sold bottled sauces and rice mixes. From the age of 16, Jocelyn had to balance helping with the business and her education, which included studying Economics in the National University of Singapore. The oldest of six children, she took over the business aged 21 when her father died. She married Richard Wong in 1997 and with him had three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Full Show: Jocelyn Chng on 'High Flyers' (08/26)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-08-26/full-show-jocelyn-chng-on-high-flyers-08-26|series=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
At the age of 14, she started her own business, pairing private tutors with students to earn a commission. She also sold cosmetics in her free time and stopped only when she started working in Sin Hwa Dee.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/recipe-for-success-0|title=VendCafe's Jocelyn Chng on her recipe for success|last=hermes|date=2016-12-12|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the business was first handed over to her in 1988, it was in debt and competitors were betting that Sin Hwa Dee would collapse in six months’ time. As the managing director of Sin Hwa Dee, she went the extra mile for her customers to prove that they can be trusted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Working 20 hours a day, she was assisted by her mother and second sister until business slowly stabilised. By the 1990s, business not only stabilised but rapidly expanded into three instead of one factory. In 1992, after attending F&amp;B fair in Paris, she decided that there is potential in the overseas export market. To prepare for their export strategy, they decided to move into a bigger factory to accommodate the increased production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, in 1995 serious financial issues arose when the sale of its old factories was delayed and the main contractor for the new building ran away with money for renovation. Pregnant with her first child, Jocelyn had to work long hours pausing only to deliver her child and then returning to work immediately. It was only in 1998 that they started exporting their sauces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.youngparents.com.sg/family/widowed-37-3-kids-gutsy-singapore-mom-realises-her-late-husbands-dream/3/|title=Widowed at 37 with 3 kids, gutsy Singapore mom realises her late husband's dream {{!}} Page 3 of 3 {{!}} Young Parents|date=2016-12-12|work=Young Parents|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard would often help his wife with the sauce business and accompany her on overseas F&amp;B trade fairs. Through these trade fairs, he saw the potential of ready to eat meals and hot food vending machine. In 2001, together with her husband, Jocelyn started JR Foodstuff. Unfortunately, in 2004, Richard was diagnosed with lymphoma and died two weeks after being diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2008, Jocelyn turned her attention to growing JR groups. She explained, “I felt that the time was right because people’s perception of chilled and frozen food had changed. People used to buy freshly slaughtered poultry from the wet market but by then, they knew that chilled and frozen meat sold in supermarkets is safer, fresher.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under her leadership, JR group opened the first Vendcafe serving hot meals in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/catch-up-tv/game-changers-singapore/house-of-love-myanmar-s-elderly-poor-8794200|title=Jocelyn Chng|website=Channel NewsAsia|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/hub/international-womens-day/from-a-humble-sauces-business-to-a-global-fb-firm|title=From a humble sauces business to a global F&amp;B firm|last=Chong|first=Claudia|work=The Business Times|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/instant-hit-singapore-s-first-vending-machine-cafe-draws-queues-7878602|title=Instant hit: Singapore's first vending machine cafe draws queues|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kiyoshi Aki'''|安藝 清|Aki Kiyoshi}} (born September 13, 1947) is the owner and founder of [[Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon Corporation]], one of the "Big Four" [[eikaiwa]] (conversational [[English language|English]]) schools in [[Japan]].

== Founding of Aeon ==
{{Main|Aeon (eikaiwa)}}
In 1973, Aki and university classmate [[Tsuneo Kusunoki]] founded the company AMVIC. The name was an acronym of the phrase "for AMbition and VICtory." The company would focus on foreign language studies.

Later, AMVIC International was split into two divisions. Aki became the head of {{nihongo|''AMVIC Gaigogakuin''|AMVIC外語学院|anbikku gaigogakuin}}, which provided foreign language training for students. Kusunoki assumed control of {{nihongo|''AMVIC Eikaiwa''|AMVIC英会話|anbikku eikaiwa}}, which specialized in English language education for non-native speakers.

In 1989, AMVIC International split into two separate companies, as the former partners developed differing visions of the company's future. Aki's company became Aeon, focusing on language learning in Japan. He remains Aeon's chairman as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeonet.co.jp/profile/company.html 会社概要｜英会話 AEON イーオン]&lt;/ref&gt; Kusunoki's company became [[GEOS (eikaiwa)|GEOS]], focusing on global language learning with focus on English language education. GEOS and Aeon remained competitors until April 2010 when GEOS filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100422a1.html Geos school chain files for bankruptcy &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aki's wife is [[Italian-American]], and his daughter is [[Angela Aki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20080912a1.html She, herself and AI sidebar: Mixed blessings] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5derbVPDu?url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20080912a1.html |date=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keys"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20090227r1.html Angela Aki turns to the keys for answers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US Labor Participation Rate by gender.svg|thumb|450px|United States Labor Force Participation Rate by gender 1948-2011. Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]
[[File:US Employment Trends - Indexed v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Employment trends in key variables indexed to show relative changes in the number of persons (starting point = 100). For example, from June 2009 (the official end of the [[Great Recession]]) to July 2018, the number of persons not in the labor force increased by 18% as millions of Baby Boomers retire, but the labor force increased 5%.]]

The '''labor force''' ('''[[workforce]]''' in [[British English]]) is the actual number of people available for work and is the sum of the employed and the unemployed. The U.S. labor force was approximately 160 million persons in January 2018.&lt;ref name="FRED_LF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLF16OV|title=Civilian Labor Force|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) definitions, the labor force is defined as: "Included are persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 States and the District of Columbia who are not inmates of institutions (for example, penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#c|title=BLS Glossary|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. labor force has risen each year since 1960, with the exception of the period following the [[Great Recession]], when it remained below 2008 levels from 2009-2011.&lt;ref name="FRED_LF"/&gt;

The '''labor force participation rate''', '''LFPR''' (or '''economic activity rate''', '''EAR'''), is the ratio between the labor force and the overall size of their [[Generational cohorts|cohort]] (national population of the same age range).  Much like other countries in the [[Western World|West]] during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly, largely due to the increasing number of women entering the workplace.

In the U.S., the overall labor force participation rate has declined steadily since 2000, due primarily to the aging and retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Analyzing labor force participation trends in the prime working age (25-54) cohort helps separate the impact of an aging population from other demographic factors (e.g., gender, race, and education) and government policies. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] explained in 2018 that higher educational attainment is correlated with higher labor force participation for workers aged 25–54. Prime-aged men tend to be out of the labor force due to disability, while a key reason for women is caring for family members.&lt;ref name="CBO_Prime"&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53452 CBO-Factors Affecting the Labor Force Participation of People Ages 25 to 54-February 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and the US labor force==
===Women===
In the [[United States]], there were three significant stages of women’s increased participation in the labor force. During the late 19th century through the 1920s, very few women worked. Working women were often young single women who typically withdrew from labor force at marriage unless their family needed two incomes. These women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic workers]]. This profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.

Between 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily due to the increased demand for office workers, women participating in the high school movement, and [[electrification]] which reduced the time spent on household chores. In the 1950s to the 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).

Claudia Goldin and others, specifically point out that by the mid-1970s there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by different factors. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force, choosing more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the labor force participation rate rose from approximately 59% in 1948 to 66% in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS11300000&amp;years_option=specific_years&amp;include_graphs=true&amp;to_month=1&amp;from_month=2|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with participation among women rising from 32% to 59%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS11300002&amp;years_option=specific_years&amp;include_graphs=true&amp;to_year=2006&amp;from_month=3|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participation among men declining from 87% to 73%.&lt;ref&gt;Breaking down the male participation rate by age bracket shows a marked decline in participation among men 55 and over from approximately 71% in 1948 to 44% in 2005 [http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS11324231&amp;years_option=specific_years&amp;include_graphs=true&amp;to_month=4&amp;from_month=5]. Among younger age groups a decline is noticeable, but not nearly as drastic.[http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS11300061&amp;years_option=specific_years&amp;include_graphs=true&amp;to_month=6&amp;from_month=7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS11300001&amp;years_option=specific_years&amp;include_graphs=true&amp;to_month|title=8=2006&amp;from_month=9|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the late 1960s was due to the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], and the adjustment of age of majority laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and advance their career while maintaining a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill. This implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers.

Another factor that may have contributed to the trend was the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raise children.

====Historical Trends====

According to the US Census in 1861, one third of women were in the labor force and of these one fourth were married women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yalom |first1=Marilyn |title=A History of the Wife |date=2002 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0060931566 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ellen DuBoise and Lynn Dumenil, they estimate that the number of women in the labor force from 1800 - 1900 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DuBois |first1=Ellen Carol |last2=Dumenil |first2=Lynn |title=Through Women's Eyes : An American History with Documents |date=2009 |publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's |location=Boston |isbn=0312468873 |page=338 |edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US Department of Labor, as of 2017 women make up 47% of the total labor force with 70% of them mothers with children under 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=12 Stats about Working Women |url=https://blog.dol.gov/2017/03/01/12-stats-about-working-women |website=US Department of Labor |date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men===
Men's labor force participation has been falling consistently since at least the 1960s.&lt;ref name=FRED_LFPR_Men&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate - Men|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to both the overall and prime working age (25-54), as discussed in the analysis section below.

==Analyzing the LFPR==
[[File:U.S. Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation by Educational Attainment - v1.png|thumb|right|450px|The line chart shows the long-term decline in labor force participation for U.S. males of prime-working age (25–54 years), based on educational attainment.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf|title=White House Council of Economic Advisors-The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation-June 2016-Page 13|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Overall rate===
From 1962 to 1999, women entering the U.S. workforce represented a nearly 8 percentage point increase in the overall LFPR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://voxeu.org/article/decline-labour-force-participation-us CEPR-Multiple Authors-Understanding the decline in the labour force participation rate in the United States-August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. overall LFPR (age 16+) has been falling since its all-time high point of 67.3% reached in January–April 2000, reaching 62.7% by January 2018.&lt;ref name=FRED_LFPR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decline since 2000 is primarily driven by the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Since the overall labor force is defined as those age 16+, an aging society with more persons past the typical prime working age (25-54) exerts a steady downward influence on the LFPR. The decline was forecast by economists and [[Demography|demographers]] going back into the 1990s, if not earlier. For example, during 1999 the BLS forecast that the overall LFPR would be 66.9% in 2015 and 63.2% in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/mlr/1999/12/art1full.pdf BLS-Howard Fullerton-Labor force participation: 75 years of change, 1950–98 and 1998–2025-December 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 forecast by Federal Reserve economists (i.e., before the [[Great Recession]] that began in December 2007) estimated the LFPR would be below 64% by 2016, close to the 62.7% average that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/2006a_bpea_aaronson.pdf Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System-The Recent Decline in the Labor Force Participation Rate and Its Implications for Potential Labor Supply-See Figure 3-2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The labor force participation rate decreases when the percentage increase in the defined population (denominator) is greater than the percentage increase in the labor force (i.e., the sum of employed and unemployed, the numerator). With respect to the unemployment rate, if the percentage increase in the number of unemployed (numerator) is greater than the percentage increase in the number in the labor force (denominator), the unemployment rate will rise.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barth and Dennis Heffley [http://www.cteconomy.uconn.edu/TCE_Individual_Articles/Spring_2004/LocalLaborForceParticipationRates.pdf "Taking Apart Taking Part: Local Labor Force Participation Rates"] University of Connecticut, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime working age rate===
Economists also analyze the LFPR for those prime-aged workers, aged 25–54. Mathematically, this ratio is computed with a numerator (labor force age 25-54) and denominator (civilian population age 25-54). This can help remove the impact of aging demographics, to better understand trends among working-aged persons. The prime-aged LFPR peaked at 84.5% at three times between October 1997 and April 2000. Prior to the [[Great Recession]], the rate was 83.3% in November 2007, then fell to a trough of 80.5% in July 2015, before steadily climbing back to 81.7% in January 2018.&lt;ref name=FRED_LFPR25-54&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU01300060|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate Age 25-54|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few key labor market variables that had yet to recover its pre-crisis level as of January 2018 and is an indicator of slack in the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-yellens-labor-market-dashboard/ Bloomberg-Jamrisko et. al-Yellen's Labor Market Dashboard-February 2, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Men's prime-aged labor force participation has been falling consistently since at least the 1960s. It ranged between 93-95% during the 1980s, fell to around 90% during the 2000s and was 88.5% in October 2017.&lt;ref name=FRED_LFPR25-54_Men&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC25MAUSM156S|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate - Men Aged 25-54|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher labor force participation is correlated with higher educational attainment.
*Women's prime-aged labor force participation rose consistently from at least the early 1960s, reaching a peak of 77.2% in August 1997. It has fluctuated around 75% since then, resisting the decline in men's prime age participation.&lt;ref name=FRED_LFPR25-54_Women&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC25FEUSM156S|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate - Women Aged 25-54|website=FRED|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have increased their educational attainment relative to men.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] explained in 2018 higher educational attainment is correlated with higher labor force participation. Prime-aged men tend to be out of the labor force due to disability, while a key reason for women is caring for family members. To the extent an aging population requires the assistance of prime-aged family members at home, this also presents a downward pressure on this cohort's participation.&lt;ref name="CBO_Prime"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">'''Line management''' refers to the [[management]] of [[employees]] who are directly involved in the production or delivery of [[Product_(business)|products]], [[Good_(economics)|goods]] and/or [[Service_(economics)|services]]. As the interface between an [[Organization|organisation]] and its front-line [[workforce]], line management represents the lowest level of management within an organisational [[Hierarchical_organization|hierarchy]] (as distinct from [[Senior_management|top/executive/senior management]] and [[middle management]]). 

A '''line manager''' is an employee who directly manages other employees and operations while reporting to a higher-ranking manager.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebalance.com/role-and-challenges-of-a-line-manager-2275752 Role and Challenges of a Line Manager]. F. John Reh, February 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Related job titles are [[supervisor]], [[section leader]], [[Shop foreman|foreperson]] and [[team leader]]. He or she is charged with meeting corporate objectives in a specific functional area or [[line of business]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} As an example, one type of line management at an [[automobile]] conglomerate might be the "light truck division", or even more specifically, the "light truck marketing line".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Similarly, one type of line management at a [[financial services]] firm might be "retention marketing" or "state municipal bond funds".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Responsibilities==

Line managers are responsible for implementing and enabling, through their staff, an organisation's people policies and practices in alignment with business objectives and core values. Their main functions with respect to employees include: 
* [[recruitment]] and selection,
* [[training]], [[mentoring]], [[coaching]] and [[staff development]], 
* [[performance management]] and [[Performance_appraisal|appraisal]],
* [[Employee_motivation |motivation]], 
* [[Happiness_at_work|well-being]],
* [[team building]].

Line managers' activities typically include: 
* planning the aims, objectives and priorities of their work area and communicating this to staff as appropriate; 
* deploying the resources within their control (e.g., staff time; funding) to achieve plans; 
* complying with policy and legislation; 
* providing structure, direction and purpose to their teams; 
* scheduling regular meetings with staff members to discuss progress and any issues.

Line management is also responsible for adopting (with the support of senior management) any type of organizational culture change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-scope-of-change The Scope of Change] Lynda Bourne, February 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The line management function will often cross into other functions vital to the success of a business such as [[human resources]], [[finance]], and [[risk management]]. Indeed, at corporations, responsibility for risk management is vested with line management.&lt;ref name=riskmanage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0-OPs2OnYUC&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22line%20management%22&amp;pg=PA100|title=Making enterprise risk management pay off|work=Thomas L. Barton,  William G. Shenkir,  Paul L. Walker|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human resources obligations are also increasingly being assigned or "devolved" to line managers.&lt;ref name=hrm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3WpPyiz3IIC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=%22line%20management%22&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=%22line%20management%22&amp;f=false|title=International human resource management |work=Hilary Harris,  Chris Brewster,  Paul Sparrow|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
&lt;!-- AS PER LICENCING POLICY, IT NEED NOT TO BE SAID THAT ONLY CONTENT YOU'VE WRITTEN YOURSELF, OR FROM FREELY-LICENCED SOURCES CAN BE ADDED TO THIS ARTICLE. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PASTE CONTENT FROM https://www.nationalbookstore.com/about-us/ VERBATIM! --&gt;
The history of National Book Store can be traced back to the 1930s.&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schnabel|first1=Chris|title=How National Bookstore's 'Nanay Coring' grows a nation of readers|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/features/87485-socorro-ramos-national-bookstore|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] during [[World War II]], José Ramos and Socorro Cáncio-Ramos, rented a small-corner space of a [[Haberdasher]]y situated at the foot of [[Escolta]] Bridge in [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[Manila]]. With a starting capital of {{Philippine peso|211}} (equivalent to {{Philippine peso|15,047}} in 2015), the Ramoses set up their first retail bookstore selling GI novels, text books and supplies. During World War II, the store shifted to selling sold candies, soap, and slippers due to stringent book censorship. The store experienced success but was burned down during the 1945 [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], rebuilt again and reverted to selling textbooks and stationery, the opening of the rebuilt National Book Store at the corner of Soler Street and Avenida Rizal, coincided with the first academic schoolyear after the war. In 1948, the store 
was destroyed by a Typhoon Gene but a new two storey building with a mezzanine was built to host National Book Store.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velas|first1=Mary Anne|title=National Bookstore: An accidental brand|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com.ph/business-ideas/national-bookstore-an-accidental-brand|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=Entrepreneur Philippines|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbshistory"&gt;{{cite news|title=Our History|url=https://www.nationalbookstore.com/about-us/|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=National Bookstore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Book Store began selling greeting cards in the 1950s depicting Philippine subjects to showcase local culture and traditions. The book store also launched a publishing program with international publishers such as [[McGraw-Hill]], [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hal]], [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]], [[Addison-Wesley]]. In 1955, the Ramoses were able to acquire a lot owned by the Guerrero family, where they erected the nine-storey Albercer Building in 1963 which was named after Alfredo, Benjamin, and Cecilia, where a National Book Store was hosted.&lt;ref name="nbshistory"/&gt;

National Book Store accumulated enough capital after some several years to acquire rights to reprint foreign brand greeting cards for the Philippine market. The book store had rights to reprint cards by Gibson for a few years. In 1973, outbid a more established competitor for a Philippine franchise of the greeting card brand, [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]].&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt;

===Expansion and recent history===
[[File:National Book Store in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|National Book Store in [[SM Aura Premier]], [[Bonifacio Global City|BGC]]]]
The Ramoses children proposed expanding the scope of National Book Store, and a branch along [[Recto Avenue]] was opened, an area often frequented by students. In the 1970s, branches were opened in shopping malls in [[Makati]] and [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref name="nbshistory"/&gt; For the next decades since the opening of the Recto branch, the book store grew with shopping mall owners approaching the Ramoses to set up a store inside their properties. National Book Store became one of the top 100 Philippine corporations in 1988, registering profits of $1 million on gross revenues of $34.7 million. The book store chain also became one of the Top 500 of the list by Retail Asia-Pacific, ranking 308th in 2004.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt;

In 2015, National Book Store captures the majority of the Philippine book market having a share amounting to 80 percent, and operates around 127 branches across the Philippines. It also operates Metrobooks, which opened in Hong Kong in 2007, a subsidiary based in the former British crown colony.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt;

With the pending entry of National Book Store into the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] through the renaming of Vulcan Industrial &amp; Mining Corp., another Ramos-owned company, into National Book Store Retail Corp. they would now also venture into wholesale, publishing, printing, manufacturing, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Corporate&amp;title=National-Bookstore-to-complete-backdoor-listing-by-early-next-year&amp;id=70996|title=National Bookstore to complete backdoor listing by early next year|work=BusinessWorld|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It entered the education industry in 2017 with the launch of NBS College, its first institution for higher learning at the National Book Store building on Quezon Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bilyonaryo.com.ph/2018/03/22/national-bookstores-ramos-family-forays-education-nbs-college1/|title=National Bookstore’s Ramos family forays into education with NBS College|date=2018-03-22|work=Bilyonaryo|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, it now has over 230 branches nationwide.

==Subsidiaries==
Among National Book Store subsidiaries are Powerbooks, a specialty store for books, and Metrobooks, a book store based in [[Hong Kong]]. [[Anvil Publishing]] serves as its publishing arm.&lt;ref name="rappler"/&gt; In late 2016, they launched three new specialty stores: Art Bar, for arts and crafts; Noteworthy, for stationery and gift items; and Work Station, for office supplies and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifestyle.mb.com.ph/2017/08/25/little-stores-big-ideas/|title=Little stores, big ideas|work=Manila Bulletin Lifestyle|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brand image==
[[File:National345jf.JPG|thumb|Typical store interior]]
The brand name of National Book Store was thought of by Socorro Ramos, one of the co-founders. No marketing research was conducted and was done on Ramos' impulse taking the book store name from the National Cash Register machine, a brand which was popular at the time of the book store's founding.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt;

For fifty years from the book store's establishment, the logo designed by Ramos herself was used which consists of the name of the store in a white background on a surrounded by a red and white stripe design. Ramos first came up with a logo by placing the store's name in a striped wrapper with her children finding the logo satisfactory.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt;

A new logo was adopted in 1996 following a proposal from Ramos' children and grandchildren which features the store's name in a more modern font in a red background. In a voting made within the company, 15 voted for adopting the new logo with only Ramos herself voting against the change.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurph"/&gt; The new logo design was a commissioned work by a Singapore-based company which also came up with a new store lay-out design.&lt;ref name="nbshistory"/&gt;

A new store design was executed in 2016, starting with its branch in SM City North EDSA. National Book Store collaborated with French design firm Malherbe for a new and more modern and contemporary design for their book store outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/oldest-ph-bookstore-updates-look/297334/|title=Oldest PH bookstore updates look - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsaryov was a self-nominated candidate in the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]].&lt;ref name=7414expfPoR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RCCUPE23&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/199103.html Twenty-three candidates to run for Ukraine's presidency], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (3 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/03/28/7020607/|title=Царьов іде в президенти - четвертий з Партії регіонів|work=Українська правда}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March a Party of Regions convention supported [[Mykhailo Dobkin]] nomination as a presidential candidate.&lt;ref name=7414expfPoR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/199490.html |title=Ukraine's Party of Regions expels presidential hopefuls Tigipko, Tsariov and Boiko |publisher=Interfax |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2014 the political council of that party expelled Tsaryov from the party.&lt;ref name=7414expfPoR/&gt; On 11 April 2014 Tsaryov traveled to [[Donetsk]]  and said he was ready to become a leader of the so-called "South-east movement". According to one source quoted by the National Press Agency of Ukraine, Tsaryov also assured [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|separatists in Donetsk]] that would do everything to disrupt the May 25, 2014 presidential elections. "I'm sure that will be no elections," he said. He then promised that he would create a "central authority" within the center of Donetsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/906960-tsarev-zayavil-chto-gotov-stat-liderom-separatistov-i-sorvat-prezidentskie-vyiboryi.html|script-title=ru:Царев заявил, что готов стать лидером сепаратистов и сорвать президентские выборы|trans-title=Tsarev declares he is ready to become the leader of the separatists and disrupt the presidential election|language=ru|publisher=Unian.net|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April, Oleg Tsaryov was beaten by a mob after an interview in the ICTV building in Kiev. The beating was denied by some,&lt;ref name=ToutRFE&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraines-pro-russian-candidate-quits-presidential-race/25366951.html Ukraine's Pro-Russian Candidate Quits Presidential Race ], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (29 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; though press agencies published videos of the mob and photos of Oleg Tsaryov half-naked with bruises.&lt;ref name=OTE15a14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/04/15/ukraine-radical-pro-russia-presidential-candidate-oleg-tsarov-beaten-by-angry-/|title=Ukraine pro-Russia presidential candidate Oleg Tsarev beaten by angry mob|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/ukraine-presidential-candidates-attacked-516/|title=Ukraine presidential candidates attacked in Kiev|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this beating he stated "I am against a third party interfering in the affairs of Ukraine. Until we learn to listen to each other, Ukraine will stand no chance".&lt;ref name=OTE15a14/&gt;

Tsaryov withdrew his presidential candidacy on 29 April.&lt;ref name=ToutRFE /&gt; He claimed to so because it was dangerous for him to continue his presidential campaign and meet with voters in [[Kiev]] (earlier that month Tsaryov said he had been beaten by pro-Western radical Ukrainian activists in Kiev).&lt;ref name=ToutRFE/&gt; Tsaryov called on "all presidential candidates representing Ukraine's [[east Ukraine|eastern]] and [[south Ukraine|southeastern regions]]" (namely) [[Petro Symonenko]], [[Mykhailo Dobkin]], [[Serhiy Tihipko]] and [[Renat Kuzmin]] to boycott the election; because "An election that is being held while a [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|civil war]] is unfolding must be boycotted".&lt;ref name=ToutRFE/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwIU29414/&gt; He added that if they did not withdrew they would be "playing into the hands of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution#Aftermath|illegitimate authorities]] and legitimizing not only them but also their decision to start a civil war against the eastern regions".&lt;ref name=TwIU29414&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/202884.html Ukrainian presidential candidate Tsariov withdraws from race], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (29 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After the elections Tsaryov refused to recognize the election as legitimate; as he claimed "it was a choice only of half of Ukraine".&lt;ref name=OT3614/&gt;

On May 13, 2014 Tsaryov was sanctioned by the [[European Union]] for calling for the creation of [[Federal State of Novorossiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/05/12/world/europe/12reuters-ukraine-crisis-eu-sanctions-factbox.html?ref=world|title=Factbox: EU Expands Russia Sanctions, Targets Putin Official, Military Chief|work=NYT/Reuters|date=12 May 1014|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2014, a recording of a death threat phone call allegedly made to Tsaryov by the governor of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] and owner of [[PrivatBank]], [[Ihor Kolomoisky]], began circulating in social media. In the call Kolomoisky tells Tsaryov that there is a bounty of $1 million on his head, and to stay in [[Moscow]] if he doesn't want to be killed. Tsaryov said that the call was authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/news/2014_05_15/Ukrainian-oligarch-puts-1-million-bounty-on-opponents-head-audio-recording-9493/|title=Ukrainian oligarch puts $1 million bounty on opponent's head|date=15 May 2014|agency=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2014 Tsaryov was stripped of his parliamentary immunity by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament) who also sanctioned his arrest.&lt;ref name=OT3614/&gt; Tsaryov is now wanted for making "public calls to overthrow the existing constitutional system in Ukraine, change its state borders and stage acts of disobedience, which entailed grave consequences and caused many casualties among law enforcers and peaceful civilians".&lt;ref name=OT3614/&gt;

On 26 June 2014 Tsaryov became Speaker of the "Unity Parliament" of the [[self-proclaimed]] [[confederation]] of [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic]] (in [[eastern Ukraine]]) [[Novorossiya (confederation)|Novorossiya]].&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt;

Russian prosecutors refuse to extradite Tsaryov to Ukraine and (according to Ukraine falsely) state that they have not received such a request from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/243934.html |title=Ukraine accuses Russia of breaking CIS agreements over Yanukovych extradition |publisher=Interfax |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2015 Tsaryov announced the termination of the Novorossiya confederation. He stated this was done because the confederation did not comply with the [[Minsk II]] accords.&lt;ref name=tonr20515&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uatoday.tv/politics/russian-backed-novorossiya-breakaway-movement-collapses-428372.html|title=Russian-backed 'Novorossiya' breakaway movement collapses|publisher=uatoday.tv|date=20 May 2015|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}

==Family life==
Tsaryov is married to Larissa (born in 1968) and has a teenage daughter (born in 1999) and son (born in 1995) who both study in the [[United Kingdom]] a daughter born in 2003.&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/focus/52f21e12334b2/ Children Russophile Tzareva learn to be citizens of the world in the UK], [[Tablo ID]] (5 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=December 2013}}
As a People's Deputy of Ukraine of the [[Party of Regions]] Tsaryov was known as one of the party's members most against [[Ukraine–European Union relations|closer relations between Ukraine and the]] [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/01/14/7009519/ Tsarev not afraid of gays and vacationing with his family in Europe], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (January 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2013 Tsaryov requested to the Security Service and Foreign Ministry of Ukraine to deport or/and ban foreign organizers and political consultants of the [[Euromaidan]]-protests, document scans of which he posted (and later removed) on his Facebook account. Among those named in the document notably included [[Andreas Umland]], [[Stanislav Belkovsky]], [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Gleb Pavlovsky]], and former [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25193993.html|script-title=uk:Умланд: Царьов просить заборонити в'їзд "іноземним організаторам Майданів"|trans-title=Umland: Tsaryov requests a ban on the entry of "foreign organizers of Maidans"|language=uk|publisher=Radiosvoboda.org|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsaryov was pleased with the so-called ''[[Anti-protest laws in Ukraine|anti-protest laws]]'' adopted in January 2014, stating that it was good that these laws made [[non-governmental organization]]s that accept foreign funds register as "[[foreign agent]]s" because such funds only benefited the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="pravda1"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/01/17/7009785/ Tsarev: I like the country more and more], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (January 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">'''Pioneers of Prosperity''' is an awards programme for entrepreneurs in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America that have created wealth and invested in their society. Its aim is to recognise and support today's successful enterprises and inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, leading to stronger, more sustainable development in these regions. Winning companies receive up to $100,000 to invest in their business.&lt;ref&gt;Pioneers of Prosperity http://www.pioneersofprosperity.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first awards ceremony took place in 2007 in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]. The second African award ceremony took place in Kigali, Rwanda on November 19, 2008 and awards will be held in the Caribbean and Central America in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Pioneers of Prosperity http://www.pioneersofprosperity.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

The stated objective of Pioneers of Prosperity is "to foster greater prosperity in [[developing countries]] by influencing the assumptions and behaviors of [[entrepreneurs]], policymakers, academics and business leaders".&lt;ref&gt;Pioneers of Prosperity http://www.pioneersofprosperity.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The program highlights successful models of enterprise-based development, thereby creating a stronger culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Specifically, the program aims to do the following: &lt;br /&gt;
1 - Identify competitive small and medium-size companies that are developing promising business models; &lt;br /&gt;
2 - Invest in these firms through award prize money; &lt;br /&gt;
3 - Diffuse the ideas, attitudes, and practices that set these firms apart from their peers so they may serve as role models to aspiring entrepreneurs in the region; and&lt;br /&gt;
4 - Focus international organizations on the private sector as a means for economic development.

== Africa Awards==

In 2007, the inaugural Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Africa Awards&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200711190023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200711260582.html&lt;/ref&gt; launched in five [[African Great Lakes]] countries. More than 450 firms competed from which five winners and one grand prize winner were selected. The winners received their awards in Kigali, Rwanda by His Excellency, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda on November 30, 2007.

The grand prize winner was Kenyan firm AAA Growers, which provides fresh-cut vegetables to the U.K. market; additional winners included Kencall, Enterprise Urwibutso, Virtual City Limited, Good African Coffee, and Tele-10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/597779&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 program was captured in a documentary ‘Unlocking Africa’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legatum.com/unlockingafrica/vid_trailer640480.htm&lt;/ref&gt; made by award-winning filmmaker [[Jeff Zimbalist]].

In 2008, the Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Awards (Africa) expanded to 10 countries across Africa and received almost 1,500 applications from small and medium-sized enterprise in [[Botswana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], Rwanda, South Africa and [[Uganda]]. On November 19, 2008, the second Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Africa Grand Prize was awarded to Superflux International, a [[security printing]] solutions company in Nigeria; other prizes were awarded to firms from Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. The presentation ceremony was attended by H.E. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda, and the guest of honour, H.E. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of Kenya, who awarded the Grand Prize.

The cash prizes for the Africa awards totaled US$350k and the winners were selected by a jury process from a pool of applicants evaluated according to the COW-F framework.

== Caribbean and Central America Awards==

In February 2009, the Pioneers of Prosperity Awards launched in seven countries in the Caribbean, including [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Later in 2009, Pioneers of Prosperity will launch across Central America, including the countries of [[Costa Rica]], [[the Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]].
  
The competition is open to all private sector [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) based in the participating countries that have between 5 and 250 employees and annual revenues of US$100,000 and $5,000,000. The prizes for the Caribbean awards will total to $600,000, including a $100,000 grand prize winner and several smaller prizes ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Just under 600 firms applied for the competition, which closed on March 23, 2009. The winners will be selected by a jury process from a pool of applicants evaluated according to the COW-F framework, and the prizes awarded in June 2009.

== Theoretical background==

The Pioneers of Prosperity program uses the COW-F framework,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fairbanks, "The Last Best Chance: Prosperity, Competitiveness, and Natural Capitalism-The Ultimate Integration" in The Natural Advantage of Nations: Business Opportunities, Innovations and Governance in the 21st century, ed. K. Hargroves and M. H. Smith
(London: Earthscan Publications Ltd., 2006), xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; conceived of by development expert and author Michael Fairbanks,&lt;ref&gt;Changing the mind of a nation: Element in the process for creating prosperity  http://www.sevenfund.org/pdf/Changing%20The%20Mind%20of%20a%20Nation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to identify promising business models.  The COW-F framework asserts that a good business model provides a unique value proposition to all of its stakeholders: Customers, Owners, Workers, and Future generations.

Customers receive a product they value at a competitive price; Owners receive an above average return for their investment; Workers receive a high and rising standard of living; and all of this is achieved without eroding the social or environment fabric for future generations, and ideally while investing in the broader public good.

According to Fairbanks, COW-F firms understand the correlation between satisfied employees and a successful business. Satisfied employees take pride in their place of work, have higher degrees of loyalty to their employer and have a vested interest in seeing the company succeed.  The assumption is that by investing in their employees, through both rising wages and employee training, employers find themselves with happier employees that are more productive.  Highly productive employees are a critical component of a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;Changing the mind of a nation: Element in the process for creating prosperity  http://www.sevenfund.org/pdf/Changing%20The%20Mind%20of%20a%20Nation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘Pioneers of Prosperity’ program identifies and rewards outstanding emerging market COW-F entrepreneurs.  By publicizing their stories and rewarding their efforts, it is hoped that the benefits of the COW-F model can be disseminated across the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pioneersofprosperity.org&lt;/ref&gt;  As a condition of the grant, the winners use award proceeds for improvement of the skills and capabilities necessary to further enhance the COW-F model for their workers.  The training may focus on both management and technical skills, including:  financial management, market research techniques, product design, sales, and customer service.

== Funders ==

Pioneers of Prosperity is funded by the multilateral development agency [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the private equity firm [[Legatum]], the [[John Templeton Foundation]] and the philanthropy Social Equity Venture Fund (SEVEN).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sevenfund.org&lt;/ref&gt;  It is implemented by the OTF Group,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.otfgroup.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; an international economic development consulting firm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. It’s a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers – where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer – ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

== Other names for remote service software==
* [[Intelligent device management|IDM: intelligent device management]]
* SSM: strategic service management
* RDM: remote device management

'''Robert Lucas Chance''' (8 October 1782 – 7 March 1865),&lt;ref name=thepeeragewc&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21406.htm#i214059 thePeerage.com - William Chance, father of the founders]&lt;/ref&gt; was the fifth child and eldest son of William Chance (a partner in [[Nailsea Glassworks]]) and Sarah Lucas (daughter of John Robert Lucas). He was always known as '''Lucas Chance'''.

==Working life==
He started work at his father's business in [[Birmingham]], at the age of 12, then started his own glass merchant business in London in 1815. This involved many trips to France where he formed alliances with French owners. In 1824 he purchased the British Crown Glass Company, following the death of the owner, Thomas Shutt, for £24,000, which is worth around £1 million in 2009.

He founded Chance Glass works, then formed a partnership with John Hartley in 1828. After experiencing financial difficulties in 1832, Lucas was then saved by his brother, William, who also became a partner. The partnership with Hartley's sons (who inherited the partnership on their father's death in 1833) was dissolved in 1836 and the business was then named [[Chance Brothers]] &amp; Company.

In 1830, he became great friends with [[Georges Bontemps]], a leading director of a glassworks in France, who would later assist at Chance Brothers following his exile from France. Chance was instrumental in introducing the method of Sheet glass production for making flat glass for (primarily) windows. This would eventually dispose the previous working method of Crown glass. He was also one of the great exponents in removing the crippling excise duty and the [[Window Tax]]. Following these actions, the glass trade in England started to flourish.

In 1851, Chance Brothers supplied the glass to glaze the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which was probably partly due to Chance's previous links with [[Joseph Paxton]], the architect, when supplying glass for the greenhouses at [[Chatsworth House]].

The two brothers were noted as being very philanthropic, founding a school (1845), a library and a church, all primarily for the workforce. Lucas Chance died in 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5184">'''Sewa Day''' is an international [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event celebrated primarily by [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]]-affiliated groups. It is celebrated a Sunday of October.

==Background==

''Sewa'', also ''Seva'', is short for the word ''[[Kar seva|Kar Seva]]'', which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''kar'', meaning hands or work, and ''seva'', meaning service.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |first=H. S. |last=Singha |publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000 |ISBN=8170103010 |p=121}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Image journeys: audio-visual media and cultural change in India |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Christiane Brosius, Melissa Butcher |year=1999 |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-7619-9325-4 |page=134 |pages= |url=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the word ''seva'' also means "to worship, to adore, to pay homage through the act of love". In the writings of Sikh gurus, these two meanings of ''seva'' (service and worship) have been merged. ''Seva'' is expected to be a labour of love performed without desire and intention, and with humility.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Labour of love: Kar seva at Darbar Sahib's Amrit Sarover |first=Gurmit Singh |last=Virdee |journal=Sikh Formations: Religion, Culture, Theory |volume=1 |number=1 |pp=13–28 |DOI=10.1080/17448720500231409}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kar seva'' is often translated as "voluntary labour". In the Punjabi language the person performing such service is called a ''Sevadar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Seva Sikhi Wiki Seva definition], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewa Day was launched in 2010 by a nonprofit of the same name, a charity registered in [[England]] &amp; [[Wales]] (No. 4446848).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/about-sewa-day//  Sewa Day About Us], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/facts/  Sewa Day Facts], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The first six Sewa Days were held on the first Sunday of October. This will change in 2016:

Participating groups have organised Sewa Day volunteering projects in old peoples’ homes, homeless shelters, schools in disadvantaged areas, hospitals and hospices, parks, conservation areas and farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsf.org.uk/sewa-day/  What is Sewa Day], National Hindu Students' Forum (UK), accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, over 75,000 volunteers took part in over 25 countries resulting in more than 561,000 volunteering hours. Sewa Day has taken place in the following countries:
* [[Asia]]: [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]]

:''The phrase "soft intellectual property" has other meanings, see [[soft intellectual property]].''
'''Soft IP''' or '''soft intellectual property''' is a proposed system that would enable to capture and protection of IP, with provision for making licenses available to all interested parties. This is particularly applicable to patents.
 
It is defined for situations involving the innocent [[infringement of a patent]]. An innocent infringer is one
* who did not know of the patent or
* could not reasonably be expected to have known of the patent and
* who would be willing to take a license, but might be irreparably harmed if they were subject to an injunction that stopped use of the patented invention.

The term "Soft IP" was first used at the European Patent Forum in Munich in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;EPO web site, [http://www.epo.org/about-us/press/releases/archive/2008/20080507.html ''Europe well-positioned in eco-innovation, determined to become world leader''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518045855/http://www.epo.org/about-us/press/releases/archive/2008/20080507.html |date=2008-05-18 }}, Press releases, May 7, 2008. Consulted on March 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At this conference, the [[European Patent Office]] published a report about their work on four scenarios which are considered to describe the most likely developments in the area of intellectual property. One of these scenarios (called Blue Skies) shows a novel idea called “Soft IP”, a new form of IP.

In the field of patents there is effectively a Soft IP system in UK and Germany where patents may be endorsed "Licenses of Right" (LOR).

A Licence of Right is not a [[compulsory license]] to use the patented invention. A patent may, at the request of the patent owner, be endorsed LOR in the UK and/or Germany.  The request is made by the patent owner to the German Patent Office or UK Intellectual Property Office.  As a "reward" for doing so, the annual renewal fees for the patent are reduced by 50%. Any person wishing to obtain a license may approach the patent owner and agree terms for the license, and only if unable to agree is it necessary to apply to the appropriate national patent office or court to have the terms settled.  The terms of the license, in particular the royalties to be paid for using the invention, are normally on the basis of willing licensee/willing licensor informed by actual licensing practice and where they exist, licenses entered into voluntarily by the patentee.

Provisions for LOR have been included in the proposals for the [[European Community Patent]].

'''Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC''' is an American [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] company owned by [[Sony Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Sony News Release 2016-10-03"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201610/16-1003E/index.html|title=Sony Corporation and Jackson Estate Announce Closing of Sony's Purchase of Remaining 50% Interest in Sony/ATV Music Publishing|date=October 3, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of 4.36 million songs as of March 31, 2018 (according to Sony's fiscal year 2018 annual report). This figure combines Sony/ATV's 2.3 million songs and the 2.06 million songs of [[EMI Music Publishing]] it administers.

The company was formed in 1955 as [[Associated Television]] (ATV), a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] broadcaster and production studio. ATV acquired [[Northern Songs]], publisher of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue, in 1969. Entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV Music in 1985 for $47.5 million. Ten years later in December 1995, Jackson agreed to merge the company with Sony Music Publishing, a  [[Sony|Sony Corporation]] division, to form a 50:50 joint venture, which would become Sony/ATV Music Publishing. As ATV Music was worth more, Michael Jackson received an additional $110 million. At the time, about two thirds of ATV's value was tied to the Beatles' songs.

In 2012, an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired [[EMI Music Publishing]] for approximately $2.2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Shirley | last=Halperin | title=Sold! EMI Music Publishing to Consortium Led by Sony/ATV, Michael Jackson Estate for $2.2 Billion | date=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sony/ATV owning about 30% and the Michael Jackson Estate about 10%. Sony/ATV and EMI Music Publishing operate as one company, with Sony/ATV administering the catalogue of EMI Publishing. Subsequent to the acquisition, Sony/ATV became the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of over 3 million songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sonyatv.com/en|title=Sony/ATV|website=Sonyatv.com|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 2016, Sony bought the Jackson estate's 50% stake in Sony/ATV&lt;ref name="Sony News Release 2016-10-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7526542/sony-atv-michael-jackson-publishing-acquisition-completed|title=Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing|last=Christman|first=Ed|date=September 30, 2012 |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $750 million, valuing Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). In October 2018, the [[European Commission]] approved Sony/ATV's outright acquisition of [[EMI Music Publishing]].

== History of ATV ==

[[Associated Television]] (ATV) was a British television broadcasting company founded in 1955 by [[Lew Grade]]. Over the next two decades, ATV expanded through acquisitions to become an entertainment conglomerate with business lines in the record industry, music publishing and film production.

ATV acquired [[Northern Songs]], publisher of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue, in 1969.&lt;ref name="guest 8"&gt;Guest (2006) p8&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog featured almost every song written by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, [[Brian Epstein]] and [[Dick James]], who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref name="guest 8"/&gt; Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.&lt;ref name="guest 8"/&gt;

In 1970, ATV formed a joint publishing venture with [[Don Kirshner|Kirshner Entertainment]], called ATV-Kirshner Music.&lt;ref&gt;"ATV,Kirshner Organize Global Publishing Co.; Maclen In Fold" ''Billboard'' August 22, 1970: 7&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership agreement expired at the end of 1972 at which time ATV Music was formed to manage all of ATV's publishing interests, including Northern Songs. ATV Music remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s, largely due to the performance of Northern Songs. ATV Music also entered into co-publishing agreements with Lennon and McCartney, whose contract with Northern Songs expired in 1973.

While ATV Music was successful, its parent company, now known as Associated Communications Corporation (ACC) began experiencing financial difficulties. From 1978 to 1981, ACC's profits declined due to losses in its film division, and share prices dropped dramatically. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]]. In 1981, Grade entertained offers for Northern Songs, drawing interest from several bidders. McCartney, with Lennon's widow [[Yoko Ono]], offered £21 million but the offer was declined by Grade who decided not to sell Northern Songs separately after other suitors, including [[Sony Music#1938–1990: Columbia/CBS Records|CBS Songs]], [[EMI Music Publishing]], [[Warner Communications]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Martin Bandier|the Entertainment Co.]] showed interest in buying ATV Music as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John.

"Beatle Catalog Hopefuls Hit 'All Or Nothing' Snag" ''Billboard'' December 12, 1981: 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Australian businessman [[Robert Holmes à Court]] had been acquiring shares of ACC and launched a takeover bid in earnest in January 1982. Grade resigned as chairman and was replaced by Holmes à Court who successfully acquired a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170543b.htm |title=Holmes à Court, Michael Robert Hamilton (1937–1990)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing, The Australian National University |accessdate= January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Holmes à Court assumed control of ACC, ATV Music was no longer for sale.&lt;ref&gt;"West Coast Publishers Keep Things Happening" ''[[Record World]]'' 27 February 1982: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sale of ATV Music to Michael Jackson in 1985 ==
[[File:Michael 1988 by himself.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music in 1985 and merged it with Sony a decade later.]]
During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording "[[Say Say Say]]" for Paul McCartney's ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' album. Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening while at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for.&lt;ref name="hilburn"&gt;{{cite news |title=The long and winding road |author=Hilburn, Robert |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-hilburn-michael-jackson-sep22,0,540678,full.story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 22, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying "Great. Good joke."&lt;ref name="tara 333–334"&gt;Taraborrelli (2004) p333–334&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was first informed that the ATV catalog was up for sale in September 1984 by his attorney, [[John Branca]], who had put together Jackson's earlier catalogue acquisitions. Warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs, Jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"&gt;Taraborrelli (2004) p335–338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Branca approached McCartney's attorney to query whether the Beatle was planning to bid. The attorney stated he wasn't; it was "too pricey."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jdoyle pophis"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?p=2517|title=Michael &amp; McCartney, 1990s–2009|author=Doyle, Jack|date=July 7, 2009|work=The Pop History Dig}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bert Reuter, who negotiated the sale of ATV Music for Holmes à Court, "We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time."&lt;ref name="ch7news"&gt;{{Cite episode | title =Michael Jackson 1958–2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htpIVyUtec | accessdate=January 9, 2010 |series = Today Tonight| network = [[Seven Network]]| station = [[TVW]]| airdate = 2009-06-25| minutes = Coverage of the sale of ATV Music at 2:36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's widow, [[Yoko Ono]] had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding.&lt;ref name="jdoyle pophis"/&gt;

The competitors in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included [[Charles Koppelman]] and [[Marty Bandier]]'s New York-based the Entertainment Co., [[Virgin Records]], New York real estate tycoon [[Samuel J. LeFrak]], and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46&amp;nbsp;million to Holmes à Court. Branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39&amp;nbsp;million. Jackson was only interested in the music [[copyrights]], but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding [[Memorandum of understanding|memorandum]] of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;

The two sides began drafting contracts in January 1985 and follow-through meetings began on March 16. Jackson's team described the negotiations as frustrating, with frequent shifts of position by the seller. One Holmes à Court representative described the negotiations as a "game of poker". Jackson's team thought they had reached a deal several times, but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate. The prospective deal went through eight drafts. In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over $1&amp;nbsp;million. In June 1985, they learned Koppelman/Bandier had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy the catalog for $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;

But in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised his bid to $47.5&amp;nbsp;million, but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed [[due diligence]] of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon]].&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ch7news" /&gt; Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5&amp;nbsp;million on August 10. 1985.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit [[Perth, Western Australia]] and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ch7news"/&gt;

The only Beatles song in the Northern Songs catalog that was excluded from the sale was "[[Penny Lane]]", the rights to which were gifted by Holmes à Court to his then-teenage daughter Catherine before the sale, as it was her favorite Beatles song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forde|first1=Eamonn|title=The long and winding road: how Paul McCartney is clawing back his catalogue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/21/paul-mccartney-reclaims-composition-rights-beatles|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Sony secures another stake in Michael Jackson's music venture {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 15.03.2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/sony-secures-another-stake-in-michael-jacksons-music-venture/a-19117580|website=DW.COM|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions to the acquisition ===

In an analysis of the acquisition, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that if "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" were to earn $100,000 a year in royalties, the Lennon estate and McCartney would divide 50% of the income; $25,000 each. The publisher, Jackson, would receive the other 50%; $50,000. It was mentioned that "Yesterday" probably earns more than $100,000 a year. The publisher would also control the use of the song in films, commercials and stage productions.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Jackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had himself used the [[Buddy Holly]] song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560&amp;nbsp;million and a royalty income of $41&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Jackson stated, "If he didn't want to invest $47.5&amp;nbsp;million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;

Appearing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' shortly after Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship:&lt;ref name="mcca lettrmn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kYDdBWESQw |title=Paul Mccartney on David Letterman – Part 2 of 3 | date=July 17, 2009 | accessdate=November 19, 2010 |format=YouTube video |work=At 3:25 McCartney talks about Jackson acquiring the Beatles songs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, it was time for a raise. Well you would, you know. [David Letterman: Yes, I think so.] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, "That's just business Paul." You know. So, "yeah it is", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ono was pleased that Jackson had acquired Northern Songs and called it a "blessing".&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the [[dragon lady]] strikes again.'"&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;

We have been working on this for over a year and, now, with the two of us together, the sky is our only limit.|source=Michael Jackson, 1995.&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt;}}

=== Merger of ATV with Sony Music Publishing in 1995 ===
Michael Jackson record label's owner, US-based media group [[CBS Corporation]], was negotiating the sale of its record division at the end of the 1980s. [[Sony]], which sought to diversify into music, films and games, acquired CBS Records Inc. in January 1988, then changed its name to Sony Music Entertainment Inc. in January 1991 (then Sony Music Holdings Inc. in December 2008). Looking for further opportunities, Sony aimed to expand its music publishing interests and offered Jackson $110&amp;nbsp;million for a 50% stake in a combined ATV and Sony Music Publishing joint venture. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13"&gt;Guest (2006) pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson had essentially sold half ownership of the Beatles' and others' songs for a large profit.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; Jackson's own songs, grouped in the Mijac catalog, were not included in the deal.&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Sony/ATV+%22michael+jackson%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=-JHYSY-XJYbEzQSywKCgCg|title=Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600&amp;nbsp;million|date=November 27, 1995|publisher=''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]''|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. "Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies."&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt; He added that Jackson recognises Sony's "leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself".&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt; Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt;

In 2006, Sony gained operational control of Sony/ATV and obtained an option to buy half of Jackson's stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million.&lt;ref name="WSJ20100621"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703438604575315364195884770|title=Jackson Estate Steers to Next Challenge: Loan Refinancing|last=Smith|first=Ethan|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-05|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20090720"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/business/20fund.html|title=Jackson Assets Draw the Gaze of Wall Street|date=July 19, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-05|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard20090815"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyatv.com/index.php/news/549|title=The Company To Watch|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalog acquisitions (2001–2007) ===
Sony/ATV Music Publishing continued to acquire song catalogues in the 21st century.

In November 2001, the company signed country singer Tony Martin to an exclusive songwriting and co-publishing deal. Through the deal, they acquired Martin's Baby Mae Music catalog of 600 songs, which includes [[Joe Diffie]]'s "[[Third Rock from the Sun (album)|Third Rock from the Sun]]" and [[Jeff Carson]]'s "[[Not on Your Love]]".&lt;ref name="Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2001/11/19/daily12.html|title=Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin|date=November 20, 2001|publisher=''[[Nashville Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, Sony/ATV Music Publishing bought veteran country music publisher [[Acuff-Rose Music]] for $157&amp;nbsp;million. The venture included music publishing rights to 55,000 country music songs, including the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[The Everly Brothers]] and [[Roy Orbison]],&lt;ref name="Jackson made Exeter FC director"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2088831.stm|title=Jackson made Exeter FC director|date=July 3, 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In Brief: Clinic, Alanis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clinic/articles/story/5934800/in_brief_clinic_alanis|title=In Brief: Clinic, Alanis|date=July 2, 2002|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[master recording]]s of the defunct label [[Hickory Records]].

Another company acquisition was made in 2007, when Sony/ATV purchased [[Famous Music]], a music publishing business with song catalogue of more than 125,000 songs including "[[Moon River]]" and "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]", for $370 million. The deal, sought by [[Viacom]], included the assumption of around $30&amp;nbsp;million of debt. The song catalogue also includes the hits of [[Eminem]], [[Akon]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Björk]], [[Shakira]] and [[Beck]], as well as music from films released by Viacom divisions [[Paramount Pictures]] (which had founded Famous Music in 1928) and [[DreamWorks Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-05-30-2986621890_x.htm|title=Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson buys Eminem rights"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/31/news.eminem|title=Jackson buys Eminem rights|last=Swash|first=Rosie|date=May 31, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable administration and distribution deals ===
Digital [[sheet music]] provider Musicnotes.com announced in June 2006 that it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

===Takeover of EMI Publishing in 2012===
In November 2011, [[Citigroup]] announced a deal to sell EMI in two pieces. Recorded music went to [[Vivendi]]'s [[Universal Music Group]] for $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion. [[EMI Music Publishing]] went to a Sony/ATV-led consortium for around $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua R.

While Sony/ATV acquired about 30% of EMI Publishing, it put up a much lower cash contribution. In exchange, it agreed to administer the entire catalog.

=== Acquisition of Jackson's stake by Sony in 2016 ===
On October 8, 2015, it was reported that Sony would sell its 50% stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing to the Michael Jackson Estate.&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sony-plans-sell-its-stake-sony-atv-music-publishing-1523032 Sony plans to sell its stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing] ibtimes.co.uk October 8, 2015, Retrieved on November 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sony-atv-music-20151017-story.html Sony/ATV sale expected to attract rivals, private equity] Ryan Faughnder latimes.com October 17, 2015, Retrieved on December 29, 2917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolling Stones"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sony-michael-jackson-estate-in-talks-for-transfer-of-massive-catalog-20151009 Sony, Michael Jackson Estate in Talks for Transfer of Massive Catalog] Steve Knopper rollingstone.com October 9, 2015, Retrieved on December 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to those reports, in October 2015, it was reported that a clause had been triggered in the agreement between Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson, allowing Sony to make a takeover bid for the Sony/ATV stake held by the estate of Michael Jackson, or vice versa. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.&lt;ref name="bb-sonytrying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Sony Really Trying to Sell Its Publishing Giant? Behind the Scenes of the Sony/ATV Deal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6722613/sony-atv-sale-analysis-contract-michael-jackson-estate|website=Billboard|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it will acquire the Jackson estate's stake in Sony/ATV in a deal valued at around $750 million, pending regulatory approval. The Jackson estate will retain a 10% stake in EMI Music Publishing, and its ownership of Mijac Music, which holds the rights to Michael Jackson's songs and master recordings. Sony Entertainment CEO [[Michael Lynton]] stated that the purchase would "enable Sony to more quickly adapt to changes in the music publishing business, while at the same time continuing to be an unparalleled leader in the industry and a treasured home for artists and writers." The revenue will primarily be used to pay off the estate's $250 million in debt, with the remainder to be placed in trust for Jackson's children. The deal was completed September 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing"/&gt;
===Acquisition of 60% of EMI Publishing in 2018 ===
In March 2018, media reported that Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund who was one of the buyers of EMI Publishing in 2012, has held talks with Sony and approached other possible buyers to sale its entire stake. Mubadala is reportedly seeking a valuation of at least $4 billion, almost twice what the Sony-led group paid six years ago.

On May 22, 2018, Sony announced it signed a legally binding [[memorandum of understanding]] ("MOU") for the sale of the Mubadala consortium's approximately 60% equity interest in EMI Music Publishing to Sony Corporation of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony, for $2,3 billion, based on an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Assuming the transaction goes through (it is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals), Sony will indirectly own approximately 90% of EMI Music Publishing.

In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought out the Jackson estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. Sony has agreed to pay $2.3 billion to acquire EMI, as well as assume EMI’s debt of $1.359 billion. With Sony and Jackson’s share valued at $1.091 billion that gives EMI Music Publishing a valuation of $4.75 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8467903/sony-completes-acquisition-of-michael-jackson-estates-share-of-emi-music|title=Sony Completes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Share of EMI Music Publishing|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony has declined to offer any concessions to the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sony-declines-to-submit-concessions-in-ec-over-proposed-2-3bn-emi-music-publishing-buyout&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other developments ===

==== Death of Michael Jackson ====
Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately."&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aepaK43omDjk|title=Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles Rights|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=June 27, 2009|accessdate=June 28, 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and [[Jackson family|his family]], also commended the business side of the musician. "His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once I explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts."&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights" /&gt;

==== Ownership of the Beatles songs ====
In May 2001, Jackson denied rumours that he was planning to sell the Beatles' song catalogue. Rumours had circulated that the singer was to sell them in order to finance the upkeep of [[Neverland Ranch]] and to cover legal bill expenses.&lt;ref name="Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles song"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1323693.stm|title=Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles' songs|date=May 10, 2001|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer announced in a statement, "I want to clarify a silly rumour – The Beatles catalogue is not for sale, has not been for sale and will never be for sale."&lt;ref name="Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles song" /&gt;

Following [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson's death]] in June 2009, there were reports that Jackson had left the Beatles catalogue to McCartney in his [[Will and testament|will]], having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-jackson-left-the-beatles-catalog-to-paul-mccartney-2009-6 Michael Jackson Left The Beatles Catalog To Paul McCartney] ''Business Insider'' (June 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs.&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights" /&gt;

On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/paul-mccartney-sue-sony-rights-beatles-songs|title=We can't work it out: Paul McCartney to sue Sony for rights to Beatles classics|date=18 January 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=19 January 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38675147|title=Sir Paul McCartney sues Sony over Beatles songs|date=19 January 2017|access-date=19 January 2017|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/04/beatles-song-rights-dispute-paul-mccartney-and-sony-atv-work-it-out|title=Beatles song rights dispute: Paul McCartney and Sony ATV work it out|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=July 3, 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/06/30/sony-beatles-copyright/|title=Paul McCartney Settles with Sony/ATV to Reclaim Beatles Copyright|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation==

=== Relevant value ===
A recent and relevant valuation is tied to Sony's acquisition of Jackson estate's stake in the company, completed on September 30, 2016&lt;ref name="Sony News Release 2016-10-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing" /&gt; for $750 million. This values Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). &lt;!--This valuation is relevant because it is based on an actual sale.--&gt;

=== Previous estimates ===
Before the 2016 transaction with Sony, the reported value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing has varied across time and sources. Such valuations are uncertain, as illustrated by their wide variations, given a lack of actual transactions.
* In 2002, ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine estimated Jackson's 50% stake in the company, along with other music publishing ventures, to be worth $450&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Who's The Unfairest Of Them All?"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0812/054_print.html|title=Who's The Unfairest of Them All?|last=Pulley|first=Brett|date=December 8, 2002|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Industry experts valued the catalogue at between $600&amp;nbsp;million and $1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004, based on the sales of rival catalogues.&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-04-27-jackson-finances_x.htm|title=Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says|last=Gary|first=Strauss|date=April 27, 2004|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Koppelman, a veteran music industry executive, stated that $1&amp;nbsp;billion was more reflective of Sony/ATV Music Publishing's worth.&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says" /&gt; "Buyers would be lining up around the block if it were ever put up for sale," he said. "And I'd be in the front of the line."&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says" /&gt;
* In 2005, Jackson's defense attorney, [[Thomas Mesereau]], claimed that the song catalogue had been valued at between $4&amp;nbsp;billion and $5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Witness: Jacko Lived Way Above Means"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155356,00.html|title=Witness: Jacko Lived Way Above Means|date=May 3, 2005|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of 2007, Jackson's own financial documents stated that his 50% share of the catalogue was worth $390.6&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/30/entertainment/main5125862.shtml | title=Family: Michael Jackson Had A Will|work=CBS News|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have made the entire catalogue worth $781.2&amp;nbsp;million.
* In 2009, the value of the company was further estimated by Ryan Schinman, chief of Platinum Rye, to be $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="value"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forbes.com/2009/06/26/michael-jackson-beatles-business-media-estate.html|title=Michael Jackson's Estate Sale|author=[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]]|date=June 26, 2009|work=Forbes|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Startopia''''' is a [[video game]] by [[Mucky Foot Productions]] (formed by ex-[[Bullfrog Productions|Bullfrog]] employees) and published by [[Eidos Interactive|Eidos]] in 2001, in which the player administers various [[space station]]s with the task of developing them into popular hubs. The game has a comical overtone, with lighthearted humour and cartoonish [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. The game was re-released on [[GOG.com]] in September 2012, and was added to the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] catalogue in October 2013.

''Startopia'' was shortlisted for [[BAFTA]] [[Personal computer|PC]] Game of the Year in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Academy of Film and Television Arts 2001 Interactive Entertainment Award Nominees|url=http://www.bafta.org/5_ie/5_NOMINATIONS_2001TRAN.htm |accessdate=2009-09-11|year=2001|publisher=[[BAFTA]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021003230757/http://www.bafta.org/5_ie/5_NOMINATIONS_2001TRAN.htm |archivedate = 2002-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[Image:StartopiaScreen.jpg|thumb|215px|right|A screenshot of the Recreational Deck with buildings such as a Disco, Motels, Bars, Holodome and Shops.]]
The player is tasked with developing a series of [[space station]]s according to the wishes of various employers. The game is set after an apocalyptic galactic war, and many of the stations are in a state of considerable disrepair. It is hinted that these space stations are essentially the last few space-based environments available to the denizens of ''Startopia'', as most of them had been destroyed during the galactic war.

The player has no direct control over the aliens that wander about the station. Instead, it is the player's job to construct rooms and hire aliens to staff them. The rooms provide basic necessities as well as recreation, encouraging visitors to remain on the station and continue spending money. Each type of alien is suited to a particular kind of task, and individual aliens have a set of statistics that determine their value as an employee. The actual goal for the player varies from one scenario to the next; in some scenarios, the player is expected to meet an economic goal, while in other scenarios the player is required to perform a specific task such as converting a certain number of aliens, or taking over the entire station by force. A sandbox mode is also available.

As with most [[business simulation game]]s, the player builds facilities and hires workers to operate them. Some rooms take care of basic necessities such as food, sanitation, and health care, while others provide entertainment or love. Visitors may be hired by the player to remain on the station and attend to its facilities.

In addition to normal visitors, the station can also receive enemy agents. An agent can be disguised as a normal alien or appear as a shady human character sneaking around the station.

Each space station is subdivided into a number of segments into which the player may expand. These segments are initially isolated by [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s, which can be opened for a fee if the segment is vacant.

''Startopia'' draws inspiration from and makes frequent references to mainstream [[science fiction]], such as ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (the player's assistant computer ''VAL'' is a parody of ''Space Odyssey'''s [[HAL 9000|HAL]]), ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. ''Startopia'' is dedicated to the memory of [[Douglas Adams]], author of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'', who died during the game's production.

==Reception==
''Startopia'' received generally favorable reviews upon its release. It holds an average of 85% and 86/100 on aggregate web sites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=gamerankings&gt;{{cite web|title=Startopia for PC|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/342013-startopia/index.html|website=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metacritic&gt;{{cite web|title=Startopia for PC Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/startopia|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Startopia'' sold approximately 110,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|title=Footprints|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints|publisher=The Escapist|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''State v. Elliott''''', 616 A.2d 210 (Vt. 1992), is a decision of the [[Vermont Supreme Court]] holding that all [[aboriginal title]] in [[Vermont]] was extinguished "by the increasing weight of history."&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Elliott'', 616 A.2d 210, 218 (Vt. 1992) ("The legal standard does not require that extinguishment spring full blown from a single telling event. Extinguishment may be established by the increasing weight of history.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vermont Supreme Court has clarified that its holding in ''Elliott'' applies to the entire state.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Cameron'', 658 A.2d 939, 940 (Vt. 1995) ("Our holding in that case was made as a matter of law based on historical fact. Consequently, under the doctrine of [[stare decisis]], ''Elliott'' is precedent binding in general, not just binding on parties to the original case. . . . ''Elliott'' affects all lands within Vermont's boundaries.").&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the land claim became an issue in the Abenaki chief election between [[Homer St. Francis]] and [[Lester Lampman]].  Lampman advocated that the tribe take a more aggressive stance in pushing its claim to "all of Vermont as well as parts of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine."&lt;ref&gt;UPI, Indians fight for control of tribe, September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Francis won the election.

On October 18, 1987, St. Francis organized a "fish-in" with 35 other tribal members on the [[Missisquoi River]], conducted without licenses from the state.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;

Just prior to the district court's decision, Chief St. Francis withdrew the tribe's petition for [[federally recognized tribe|federal recognition]], saying:  "We don't need a Government we don't recognize to tell us we exist."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Prior history==
The case arose in the aftermath two Vermont District Court decisions.

===''State v. Saint Francis'' (1989)===
In ''State v. Saint Francis'', on August 14, 1989, Judge [[Joseph J. Wolchik]] of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County, in a 96-page decision,&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Saint Francis'', No. 1171-10-86Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 11, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  held that the Abenaki were a tribe, retained aboriginal rights to hunt and fish, and therefore did not need to acquire fishing licenses from the state.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;''New York Times'', Indians in Vermont Tribe Need No Licenses to Fish, Judge Rules, August 15, 1989, at A19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Wolchik held that the Abenaki's aboriginal area consisted of 500,000 acres in northwestern Vermont:  [[Grand Isle County]], most of [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]], and some of [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden]] and [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans]] counties.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;  Wolchik dismissed the charges against all but six of the defendants; he held that the remaining six were not tribal members.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the decision, Chief St. Francis vowed to file a land claim "as soon as possible."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  By then, St. Francis estimated the tribe's claim area as  "all of Vermont, all of New Hampshire, and parts of northern Massachusetts, western Maine, upstate New York and southern Quebec."&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;''Boston Globe'', Tribe to claim one-third of New England, August 10, 1990, at M1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Union Leader'' (Manchester, NH), Abenakis Say They Own NH, Vt., Plan To File Suit To Regain Land, August 11, 1990, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 12, 1990, several [[title insurance]] companies in Vermont attempted to amend their standard policy contracts (an action that requires approval from the state banking department) to exclude a potential Abenaki claim from coverage.&lt;ref&gt;''Union Leader'' (Manchester, NH), Native Claims Cloud Vt. Title Insurance, September 12, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''State v. Bellevue'' (1990)===
In ''State v. Bellevue'', on August 13, 1990, in another fishing rights case, Judge [[Edward Cashman]] of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County held that the Abenaki were not exempt from state criminal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="bellevue"&gt;''State v. Bellevue'', No. 1862-11-89Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 13, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Cashman, unlike Judge Wolchik, held neither tribal status nor aboriginal fishing rights could exist in the absence of a federal treaty.&lt;ref name="bellevue"/&gt;

==Opinion==
The Vermont Supreme Court reversed and remanded Judge Wolchik's decision.

The opinion's main legal innovation was holding that "[a]n historical event, although insufficient by itself to establish an extinguishment, may contribute to a finding of extinguishment when analyzed together with other events" and that "a century-long course of conduct may demonstrate extinguishment, even though the exact date on which Indian title is extinguished is difficult to determine."&lt;ref&gt;616 A.2d at 213-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded that "a series of historical events, beginning with the Wentworth Grants of 1763, and ending with Vermont's admission to the Union in 1791, extinguished the aboriginal rights claimed here."&lt;ref&gt;616 A.2d at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Legal commentary on the ''Elliott'' decision has been generally negative.  According to Joseph William Singer, a professor at [[Harvard Law School]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t defies both precedent and the longstanding policy of protecting Indian title to conclude that Congress, by the simple admission of Vermont to the Union, casually obliterated all Abenaki title in the State of Vermont, whether currently settled by non-Indians or inhabited by Abenakis.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 28 Ga. L. Rev. at 519.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gene Bergman wrote in the ''American Indian Law Review'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Elliot'' misinterprets Abenaki/Vermont history during the period from 1763 to 1791.  An honest account of history would not have found extinguishment under the traditional rules.  Hence, to avoid this conclusion, the Vermont Court created a radical new test that undermines the United States Supreme Court's rules and purposes protecting aboriginal title. . . .&lt;br&gt;Essentially, the court changed the test from an examination of intent/purpose to a review of cumulative effects.  Under this new test, a sovereign need not have known that the consequences of an act would eliminate aboriginal title.  Therefore, if the sovereign unleashed forces which eventually frustrated Indian occupancy, ''Elliot'' would find extinguishment in that act.  ''Elliot'' implicitly holds that the cumulative effects need not be manifested at the time of or near in time to the sovereign action.  The functional result of ''Elliot'' is that courts will weigh the cumulative effects of a sovereign's action over a long time—say, 200 years.  This removes the barrier prohibiting the light imputing of extinguishment.  ''Elliot'' undermines the entire framework of aboriginal title law.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 18 Am. Indian. L. Rev. at 458-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to John Lowndes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This controversial decision marks a clear departure from the longstanding aboriginal title [[aboriginal title in the Marshall Court|doctrine expounded]] in the early nineteenth century by Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] and the United States Supreme Court.  The Vermont court's decision not only breaks with the rule that a tribe must consent to extinguishment of its aboriginal title, but also rejects the requirement that the dominant sovereign must express its intent to extinguish title with a "plain and unambiguous action."  The Vermont Supreme Court's holding that the "increasing weight of history" alone can terminate Indian title disposes of the rule of law, and replaces it with a selective reading of the conqueror's history.&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, 42 Buff. L. Rev. at 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
===State recognition===
Vermont extended state-recognition to the Abenaki in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Vt. Legis. Serv. 125 (West) (codified as amended at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, §§ 851-853).&lt;/ref&gt;  The original recognition act provided:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This chapter shall not be construed to recognize, create, extend, or form the basis of any right or claim to land or real estate in Vermont for the Abenaki people or any Abenaki individual and shall be construed to confer only those rights specifically described in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Vt. Legis. Serv. 125 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 853(c) (amended 2010)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language was amended and re-codified in 2010:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognition of a Native American Indian tribe shall not be construed to create, extend, or form the basis of any right or claim to land or real estate in Vermont or right to conduct any gambling activities prohibited by law, but confers only those rights specifically described in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Vt. Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 853(h)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amendment bill also added the following language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members will continue to be subject to all laws of the state, and recognition shall not be construed to create any basis or authority for tribes to establish or promote any form of prohibited gambling activity or to claim any interest in land or real estate in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Vt. Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 851(8)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Federal recognition===
The St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont were denied federal recognition on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;Final Determination against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 72 Fed. Reg. 36,022 (July 2, 2007); see also Proposed Finding Against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis/Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 70 Fed. Reg. 69,776 (proposed Nov. 17, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Interior determined that the Abenaki failed to satisfy four of the seven criteria for federal recognition:  
#that external observers identify the group as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900,
#that a predominant portion of the group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present,
#that the group has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present, and
#that the group's membership consist of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.&lt;ref name="fed"/&gt;

[[File:Bertha Allen Station Mistress Padbury Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Station mistress at [[Padbury railway station]]]]
The '''station master''' (or '''stationmaster''') is the person in charge of a [[Train station|railway station]], particularly in the [[United Kingdom]] and many other countries outside North America. In the United Kingdom, where the term originated, it is now largely historical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotroots.com/occupations.htm| title=Old Occupations in Scotland| work=Scot Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt; or colloquial, with the contemporary term being '''station manager'''. However, the term ''station master'' remains current on many [[heritage railway]]s, and also in many countries outside the United Kingdom, notably the extensive [[Indian Railways]] network.

Historically a male occupation, women were sometimes appointed to the position, and the gender variation ''station mistress'' was sometimes employed in such cases. In the United States the role is commonly termed '''station agent'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobaps.com/SF/specs/classspecdisplay.asp?ClassNumber=9131 |title=Station Agent, Municipal Railway (#9131) |publisher=San Francisco Department of Human Resources |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job description==
The station master is responsible for the management of other station [[Employment|employees]] and holds responsibility for safety and the efficient running of the station. The term was historically employed across stations of all sizes, leading to variation in the precise role. At a major city terminus, with potentially hundreds of employees, the station master's duties would focus on personnel management and public relations. At smaller town and country stations, with a more limited staff, the station master would have far more customer interaction with travelling passengers, and would commonly deputise for other members of staff in their absence.

On the contemporary British rail network a station manager at a major station has duties very similar to those described above. The more localised role of station master at small country stations no longer exists, with group station managers taking responsibility for two or more stations. In very rural areas a station manager may be responsible for a large number of stations, or even for all the stations on a local [[branch line]].

==Deputies and staff==
[[File:Restored station master's office, Norchard Station - geograph.org.uk - 896957.jpg|thumb|Station master's office at [[Norchard railway station]]]]
Historically, the station master was deputised (in his absence) by an ''Assistant Station Master'' (ASM). In large stations this might be a full-time position. In smaller local stations the ASM title was often attached to another post, such as senior booking clerk, or even head porter. On heritage railways the ASM role is often unchanged from this historic role. The ASM post also continues in many Commonwealth nations, and other countries which have experienced British influence.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Station Master (ASM) role description at [http://www.indianrailwayemployee.com/content/job-profile-assistant-station-master-asm Indian Railways].&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary British railway operations the station manager is commonly deputised by one or more ''shift station managers''.&lt;ref&gt;Role outlined at [https://www.networkrail.co.uk/careers/working-in-a-major-station/ Network Rail] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of other employees at a railway station varies according to size. A historic station master would typically manage a number of booking clerks (responsible for ticket sales and financial auditing), [[Porter (railroad)|porters]] (responsible for platform safety, luggage transportation, and cleaning), and often ancillary staff in catering, left luggage, and maintenance roles. Although technically part of the engineering department, a station master might also have day-to-day management of [[Signalman (rail)|signalmen]] in the station's [[signal box]].

==Social position==
[[File:Former Station Masters Residence at Narrandera.jpg|thumb|The former station master's house at [[Narrandera]], Australia]]
From the late [[Victorian era]] onwards, station masters became prominent figures in local communities. Invariably they would be provided with a substantial [[house]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.transportarchive.org.uk/getobject.php?rnum=L1335&amp;searchitem=&amp;mtv=&amp;pnum=| title=Woodford Station Master's house| work=The Transport Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[rural]] [[Community|communities]] particularly, would have significant [[Social stratification|social standing]].&lt;ref name=scotby&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotbystation.co.uk/scotby_station/history.htm| title=The history of Scotby Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniforms worn by station masters, whilst varying widely between different railway companies, often incorporated gold braid embroidery, and peaked caps with gold banding, giving the office-holder a high profile in the community. With his uniform, official housing, and public prominence, the station master was respected and widely attributed with seniority in the local community.&lt;ref&gt;See details, including examples, at [http://blog.nrm.org.uk/100-years-of-station-master-memories/ 100 years of Station Master memories], National Railway Museum, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some station masters achieved legendary fame in their communities. The late James Miller, long-serving station master at [[Oxford railway station]], received widespread recognition for his devoted service in the post, including civic decoration, a public-subscription retirement gift, the award of the [[British Empire Medal]], and the naming of a carriage siding after him.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated full account from the [http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/community/memorylane/14619525.Popular_and_efficient_stationmaster_devoted_working_life_to_the_railway/ Oxford Mail] newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s many small stations were closed and the station master's house, along with other railway property, sold off. Typically, these buildings retained their original name and in many communities the ''Station Master's House'' can still be found as a private [[dwelling]]&lt;ref name="scotby"/&gt; or converted into a [[restaurant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kentrail.org.uk/meopham.htm| title=Meopham| work=Kent Rail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In current Indian society station masters continue to enjoy a high social standing{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and there is considerable competition for vacancies. Indian Railways staff who have attained the grade of assistant station master (ASM), or station master (including regional station managers), have their own professional body or trade union, the [[All India Station Masters' Association]].

'''Stefan Günther Tweraser''' (Born 18 November 1969) is an Austrian business executive, consultant, and entrepreneur. Tweraser is known primarily for his leadership roles in the European technology and telecommunications industries. In December 2015 he was named as CEO of the Berlin-based hospitality analytics firm SnapShot GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SnapShot appoints former Google Germany director as first chief executive|url=http://www.travolution.co.uk/articles/2016/01/20/14880/snapshot-appoints-former-google-germany-director-as-first-chief-executive.html|publisher=Travolution|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gavrilescu|first1=Delia|title=Former Google Exec Dr. Stefan Tweraser Named SnapShot GmbH CEO|url=http://www.argophilia.com/news/15856-2/215856/|work=argophilia.com|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tweraser grew up in Vienna, Austria, along with his three siblings. He attended the [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt|Higher Technical Institute HTL]] in Vienna for Telecommunications Engineering and later studied Business Administration at the [[Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien|Vienna University of Economics and Business]], where he was also employed from 1994 to 1997 as an assistant, and then completed his doctorate in 1997.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; Up until April 1998, Tweraser was employed as a director of studies for Marketing and Sales at the Vienna University of Applied Sciences. In early 2015, he was in a course of advanced study in psychotherapy at the [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]].

== Career ==
In 1998, Tweraser was appointed as a management consultant by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seifert|first1=edited by Alexander H. Kracklauer, D. Quinn Mills, Dirk|title=Collaborative Customer Relationship Management Taking CRM to the Next Level|date=2004|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=3540247106|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a partner in January 2003.  Later in 2003, he was named Divisional Head of Retail Marketing at [[Telekom Austria]] AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Stefan Tweraser has been Named Head of Marketing at Telekom Austria|url=http://www.a1.net/newsroom/en/2003/06/20030612_dr-stefan-tweraser-wird-marketing-leiter-von-telekom-austria/|work=a1.net|date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was responsible for product management, market communication and the company's Internet activities until his departure in 2007. During a reorganisation of the Landline division, Tweraser was responsible for sensitive personnel and budget cuts. The Telekom executive was named "Marketer of the Year 2005″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1.net/newsroom/en/2006/09/20060920_telekom-austria-marketingleiter-stefan-tweraser-als-marketer-des-jahres-ausgezeichnet|title=Telekom Austria Marketing Head Stefan Tweraser Named Marketer of the Year|work=a1.net|date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Austrian chapter of the [[International Advertising Association]] (IAA). In December 2006, he was elected president of the Austrian Volleyball Federation at the request of Telekom, which at that time was the main sponsor of the federation. He stepped down from the role in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Volleyball News|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Infomedia/WorldVolleyNews/WV_News_11_E07.pdf|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]]|date=5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Telekom Austria, Tweraser moved to Google Deutschland, where he succeeded Christian Baudis as Country Director Sales as of May 2008. Between 2007 and 2008, he was also briefly employed as the managing director of Omnimedia Werbegesellschaft, a holding of Telekom. During this time he also took over as head of Google Austria and Switzerland, when Karl Pall moved to assume his role as head of Google Canada. The newly appointed Google executive was instrumental for the search giant's marketing efforts, especially to the underdeveloped small and medium sized enterprises ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]]) in Austria and Switzerland.

Tweraser was in the thick of the 2012 Google Internet campaign to garner public support against a proposed law that would force the search engine giant to pay publishers for content offered on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scally|first1=Derek|title=Black day for German media as paper prints final edition|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/black-day-for-german-media-as-paper-prints-final-edition-1.1691|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-defend-your-net/53226/ Google “Defend Your Net” Campaign in Germany Heats Up] Mihaela Lica, Search Engine Journal, 29 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=David|title=Google launches petition against German 'link tax' proposals|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-launches-petition-against-german-link-tax-proposals/|work=[[Zdnet]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft law, which was dubbed the "Lex Google", was intended to force search engines to pay a fee to publishers when Internet users click through to their content. German lawmakers condemned Google's campaign against the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-germany-google-idUSBRE8AR0UI20121128 German lawmakers condemn Google campaign against copyright law ] Madeline Chambers of Reuters, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, the author of the proposed legislation, said she was ''"astonished that Google was trying to monopolize opinion-making."'' In an interview with Phys.org in November 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-11-google-german-copyright-law.html Google hits back against German copyright law] Phys.org 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Tweraser was quoted as commenting: ''"The majority of citizens have never heard of this draft law even though it could affect all Internet users in Germany."'' The Google executive went on to describe "restrictions to content" and to users' access, along with the higher costs that would be incurred. He also participated in a number of high level meetings and summits where the future of search was the focus.&lt;ref&gt;"Diverging logic in convergent worlds (PDF)" [http://media.medientage.de/mediathek/textservice/files/pdf/12_text_2012_1351171117.pdf] With Dr. Miriam Meckel at the MEDIENTAGE MUNICH 2012 Media Summit&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an announcement of the arraignment of Tweraser on charges of breach of trust in the so-called Telekom scandal, he stepped down from his position at Google in January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/01/15/google-germany-sales-exec-steps-down/#gref Google Germany Sales Exec Steps Down] Robin Wauters, The Next Web, 13 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before finally leaving the search-engine and advertising group at the end of February of that year.

In December 2015, the Austrian hospitality analytics company, SnapShot GmbH appointed Tweraser chief executive officer. Tweraser joined a team of hotel innovators, investors, marketing and entrepreneurial executives from across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=288361809 Company Overview of SnapShot GmbH] Bloomberg, Internet Software and Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snapshot-gmbh#/entity SnapShot GmbH] Crunchbase Company Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telekom II scandal==
On 4 December 2012, the department of public prosecution in Vienna arraigned Tweraser and three other persons on charges of breach of trust. The former Telekom executive was accused of having illegally obtained over half a million euros from Telekom Austria with the help of the advertising agency [[Havas Worldwide|Euro-RSCG]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-10/google-german-exec-charged-over-telekom-austria-kickbacks Google German Exec Charged Over Telekom Austria Kickbacks] Bloomberg, 10 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Tweraser joined Google Deutschland, he reached an agreement in the context of the termination of his contract in 2007 with the Telekom manager Gernot Schieszler under which he would be paid an additional settlement on dismissal in the amount of two annual salaries. The agency, which was managed at that time by the advertisers Gustav Eder-Neuhauser and Albert Essenther, managed the 2.5&amp;nbsp;million euro advertising budget of Telekom. According to the arraignment, the agency bosses gave their consent to "process this 'informal settlement on dismissal' via Euro-RSCG". For this purpose, Telekom was sent a pro-forma invoice in July 2007 for the sum of 585,600 euros for the "Strategic design of the sponsorship appearance in the context of Euro 2008".  Following the official departure of Tweraser from Telekom, he submitted three pro-forma invoices on behalf of his company Gekko Consulting GmbH. Although all the defendants confirmed the cash flows, they each refuted any criminally liable responsibility.

The trial (nicknamed) Telekom II began on 25 February 2014 in the Vienna Regional Court for Criminal Matters. At the adjourning of this initial trial Telekom Austria announced that Tweraser would begin to pay back the adjudicated amount in installments. Then in February 2015, Judge Michael Tolstiuk ruled that the [[Corpus delicti]] regarding breach of trust was not sufficient and that Telekom had not suffered any damage due to the payments to Tweraser. The judgement acquitted all the defendants of any wrongdoing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">The '''telecommunications industry''' within the sector of [[information and communication technology]] is made up of all [[Telecommunication]]s/[[Telephone company|telephone companies]] and [[internet service provider]]s and plays the crucial role in the evolution of [[mobile communication]]s and the [[information society]].

Traditional [[telephone call]]s continue to be the industry's biggest revenue generator, but thanks to advances in [[network technology]], Telecom today is less about [[voice call|voice]] and increasingly about text ([[messaging]], [[email]]) and images (e.g. [[video streaming]]). 
[[High-speed internet]] [[internet access|access]] for computer-based data applications such as [[Broadband service provider|broadband information service]]s and [[interactive entertainment]], is pervasive. [[Digital Subscriber Line]] (DSL) is the main broadband telecom technology. The fastest growth comes from ([[value-added service|value-added]]) [[network service|service]]s delivered over [[mobile network]]s.&lt;ref name=investopedia/&gt;

{{quote|The [[telecommunication|telecom]] sector continues to be at the epicenter for growth, innovation, and disruption for virtually any industry. [[Mobile device]]s and related [[broadband]] [[internet connectivity|connectivity]] continue to be more and more embedded in the fabric of society today and they are key in driving the momentum around some key trends such as [[video streaming]], [[Internet of Things]] (IoT), and [[mobile payment]]s.|Deloitte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/telecommunications-industry-outlook.html|title=2017 Telecommunications Industry Outlook - Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Think of telecommunications as the world's biggest machine. Strung together by complex [[telecommunications network|network]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[internet]]-linked [[personal computer|PC]]s, the global system touches nearly all of us.

==Market segmentation==

Of all the [[customer]] [[market (economics)|market]]s, residential and [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small business]] markets are the toughest. With hundreds of players in the market, competitors rely heavily on price; success rests largely on brand name strength and investment in efficient [[Telecommunications billing|billing]] systems. The [[corporation|corporate]] market remains the industry's favorite. Big corporate customers are concerned mostly about the quality and reliability of their telephone calls and data delivery while being less price-sensitive than residential customers. [[Multinational corporation|Multinationals]], spend heavily on telecom infrastructure and premium services like [[Network security|high-security]] [[private network]]s and [[videoconferencing]]. Network connectivity can also be provided to other telecom companies by wholesaling circuits to heavy network users like internet service providers and large corporations.

== Mergers and Acquisitions ==
Around 24,800 M&amp;A deals have been conducted in the Telecommunication Industry with either the acquirer or the target company coming from the Telecommunications sector. In total over 5.712 bil. USD have been spent on M&amp;A between 1985 and 2018 in this industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has only been one big M&amp;A wave around 1999 and 2000. In most other industry there are three waves between 1990 and 2018. Since 1999 deal value shrunk by -90.12% and is expected to stagnate in 2018.

== History ==
The subject of a London Chamber was first discussed in early 1906, when a number of meetings regarding the arrangement of a Swedish exhibition, led to the establishment of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in London. The Certificate of Incorporation was granted by the Board of Trade and offices were hired at 136, Fenchurch Street. At the end of 1907 no less than 189 members had been elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scc.org.uk/about/history/|title=Swedish Chamber of Commerce {{!}} History|website=www.scc.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Thomas Anthony "Tony" Ryan''' (2 February 1936 – 3 October 2007) was an Irish billionaire, philanthropist and businessman.

He was a founder of [[Guinness Peat Aviation]] (GPA) as well as co-founder of [[Ryanair]] with Christopher Ryan and Liam Lonergan.&lt;ref name="sunday times obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2584688.ece |title=Tony Ryan: Founder of Ryanair, the budget carrier which transformed European air travel |work=The Sunday Times |date=3 October 2007 |publisher=[[News Intl]] |location=London |issn=0140-0460 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryanair was believed to be the main source of his wealth in later life: the company is now one of the biggest airlines in Europe and is valued at over 10 billion US dollars as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RYAAY |title=RYAAY: Summary for Ryanair Holdings plc- Yahoo!

==Business career==
Born in [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], Ryan worked for [[Aer Lingus]], before going on to found their aircraft leasing arm, [[wet lease|wet-leasing]] out their aircraft in the quieter winter months.

In 1975, with Aer Lingus and the Guinness Peat Group, he founded Guinness Peat Aviation (later GPA Group), an aircraft leasing company, with a $50,000 investment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ria.ie/news/tony-ryan-wizard-skies|title=Tony Ryan: wizard of the skies|date=2016-07-15|work=Royal Irish Academy|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPA grew to be the world's biggest aircraft lessor, worth $4 billion at its peak. But its value dramatically collapsed in 1992 after the cancellation of its planned [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/gpa-soared-before-crashlanding-26130164.html|title=GPA soared before crash-landing - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made €55m from the sale of [[AerFi]] (the successor to GPA) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/tony-ryan-to-pocket-47m-as-former-gpa-sold-off-26109868.html|title=Tony Ryan to pocket $47m as former GPA sold off - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was a [[tax exile]] who lived in [[Monte Carlo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/business/04ryan.html|title=Tony Ryan, Who Founded Discount Airline, Dies at 71|last=News|first=Bloomberg|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also owned a [[stud farm]] near his home in Dolla [[County Tipperary]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was the 7th wealthiest individual from Ireland in the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2007]] with over €1.5bn(£1bn).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/declan-and-shane-ryan-and-family-s02k27g2hrk|title=Declan and Shane Ryan and family|date=2008-04-27|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan over the years helped nurture two successful business protégés – [[Denis O'Brien]] and [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]] – both of whom became billionaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Woman |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/rich-list/irelands-rich-list-3140-2116348.html |title=Ireland's Rich List: 31–40 |work=The Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Ryan was an active and innovative funder of university education in Ireland. He donated a marine science institute to [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUI Galway]] in 1993 which was named the Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute in honour of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/over-1m-donated-for-marine-and-energy-research-1.1337068|title=Over €1m  donated for   marine and energy  research|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed interest in marine science and aquaculture development in the west of Ireland.

The XBRL Global Ledger Taxonomy Framework (XBRL GL) is a holistic and generic XML and XBRL-based representation of the detailed data that can be found in accounting and operational systems, and is meant to be the bridge from transactional standards to reporting standards, integrating the Business Reporting Supply Chain.

XBRL GL is developed by the XBRL GL Working Group of XBRL International.

XBRL GL can be used by [[Computer program]]s for information interchange of accounting [[General ledger]] balances (summarized information) as well as complete accounting ledgers (payables, receivables, inventory, payroll, order entry, purchasing, banking) supporting object oriented accounting, quantity accounting and transparency support. The instance documents (XML files) can also be viewed in Web browsers using [[XSL]] or programmatically; it can also be carried in Inline XBRL. [[XBRL]] is designed to standardize the data, processes and rules of Business Reporting as a whole, although most implementations focus on financial reporting. XBRL GL can support the detail and integrate to all manners of reporting, financial, tax, sustainability, statistics and otherwise, and carry both quantitative and qualitative information.

==Relation to UN/CEFACT accounting and SIE==
There are a number of other efforts that seek to standardize parts or all of the data in an ERP system, although most focus on the general ledger. Amongst the competing/complementary efforts in the space are [[UN/CEFACT]], [[OECD]] [[SAF-T|Standard Audit File]] and [[SIE (file format)]] accounting interchange file formats.

XBRL GL is an [[XML]] focused format. [[UN/CEFACT]] is UML ([[Unified Modeling Language]])-based, with standard naming and design rules to convert it to an XML file format. In Sweden the elder (1992) domestically [[SIE (file format)]] is a tagged text file format. The XML technology is much better suited to work with modern HTML and WEB-based technology and tools. The XML files are in the range 20-50 times larger than SIE files on the hard disk.

Due to the needs of the tax community in many countries, the Standard Audit File is generic, but an example of a proprietary XML format is provided.

The XML format abilities (such as validation capabilities) and the huge activities around XBRL and UN/CEFACT have created a huge potential and expectations of modern accounting technologies. XBRL GL is certainly formed from its origins, the audit and financial reporting societies in the USA and globally. UN/CEFACT is working on trade administration theme and accounting is the terminal point of trade administration and its file format is designed from a trade administration point of view. The Standard SIE from a local Swedish vendor society’s market interests.

All three file formats are however transparent and independent of any charts of accounts and tax regulations.

== Accounting information interchange issues - The accounting file standard stand-off==

=== Is a common international accounting file format possible? ===

There has been quite some file format debate. However differences in [[Chart of accounts]] between countries, represents a much bigger compatibility problem of information interchange between accounting and financial reports between accounting cultures. Tax regulations also make huge differences in the actual content of accounting and financial report information between countries.

The basic issue is if it is possible to transfer accounting data over governmental boundaries and the data would be understood by the receiver? Will it be possible for someone to read a balance sheet with a foreign chart of accounts and understand it? Will it make any difference to transfer it by computer files in standardized file formats?

The EU commission has spent large efforts into the field of tax administrative harmonisation and for instance is the main intention latest version of the [[EU VAT]] directive to achieve this and to support electronic trade documents like electronic invoices better in cross border trade especially within the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]]. But there is still a huge way to real compatible charts of accounts and international accounting information interchange.

One question is if international trade agreements have much value without a global harmonisation in VAT tax administrative legislation between the agreeing parts. The EU-agreements with countries like Norway do not include VAT union membership. And so goods are stuck in customs (to large costs) for VAT declaration and administratively it requires a lot of work. Work and halting not happening within the EU VAT union. With global VAT legislation administrative harmonisation a lot is suddenly possible. Many new international free trade agreements are in 2013 in bargain state.

===Procurement - Being a standard organisation or not?===

Another problem is the EU [[government procurement]] regulations in demands of [[standards organisation]]s specifications, of recognition of the private market efforts from many initiatives being made so far. It actually stops governmental administration to take part, contribute and use the work being done so far. UN/CEFACT is an official UN [[standards organisation]], but [[UN/CEFACT]] have big problems finalizing its project and few if any, understand the general idea on how to apply UN/CEFACT accounting, UN/CEFACT(EDIFICAS) being asked can't/don't tell. This is one of the main problems for tax authorities to make demands/providing service for the companies on electronic interchange of data. (A question is how long the world can afford modern procurement?) However XBRL looks for recognition as [[standards organisation]].

===The benefit of the data producer?===

XBRL has a general problem being designed for the receiving users of information like audits and analysers and it doesn’t look to be enough really convincing arguments for the information producers (companies doing the actual accounting) to pay for the XBRL GL file producing features in [[commercial software]]. And without support of the information producers there will be no data for the analysers and audits in XBRL GL format, and so no market for [[commercial software]] for them either.

===What defines accounting boundaries and accounting file contents?===
Accounting is originally manual work and parts of it has been computerised using accounting [[commercial software]]. But a commercial aspect of accounting is its boundaries and what should be included in accounting [[commercial software]] feature packages.

The accounting work is making accounting vouchers with entries and then check the entries are right. The major checking tools are the bank account statements to and cash (register) lists, to prove that every monetary transaction is accounted for in the accounting. Still this checking is to a large extent manual very labour-intensive work computers do much better. Secondly proving that there are evidences for what the transactions consist of by the voucher documentation. Vouchers that are incoming and outgoing invoices (and receipts), in practice a physical voucher folder. (Still the EU VAT directive and many countries VAT legislation demands keeping physical paper folders of vouchers making scanned vouchers not that smooth to work with. This despite the EU commission has a vision of electronic vouchers. Same legislation makes problems with electronic invoices and integration with accounting. So there are still much to solve.)

Another way of looking it are the legal demands and 95% of all legal demands of accounting comes from VAT legislation where the EU VAT directive ([[European Union value added tax]]) is the most fully covering documentation. By it is’s obvious that invoices and receipts are more than other things, accounting documents (required by the VAT legislation), secondly civil law documents and thirdly as general trade documents. The accounting documenting (required by the VAT legislation) is the main regulated part, actually the main regulating law of the entire accounting.

To make benefits for the producer of the data it is most likely in this field integration and atomisation features are that are worth paying for by the paying customer of commercial software producing accounting information files (like XBRL GL SIE and UN/CEFACT). To do that invoices (with [[Accounts payable]]s and [[Accounts receivable]]s) and bank account statements could be considered as accounting documents, and included in a standard file format solution. None of the present file formats do.

The lack of accounting integration is also the most likely reason for electronic invoice formats perform still very low market volumes and progress also here is slow. Mainly because the electronic invoice formats are not in first designed after accounting and VAT legislation demands, but in unregulated trade document perspectives.

Interesting is that there are no standard file formats for bank account statements and it is not (according to the UN/CEFACT banking group TBG5) in the interest of the banks, but for accounting to have, making automatic matching possible with accounting. However an international standard file format for bank account statements would make huge benefits in developing internet banking pages with new features benefitting the bank customers. Especially if integration with a standard invoice (receipt) format would be included.

===Applied use instruction set to be understood - making a commercial software market possible===

XBRL GL is also without an additional use instruction set, not tight/clear enough in of its file format, still making it very uncertain, in how to use XBRL GL. That a reading party would actually understand what data in an external XBRL GL file, really stands for.

The situation is like agreeing on using a common writing alphabet without agreeing on what language to use it for. If someone sends a letter in Portuguese in Latin letters to a Dutchman often the Dutchman do not understand Portuguese, even though he can read Latin letters. We have the same problem here. And with no general solution, agreements between every writing and reading user must be made, and that is not a smooth solution getting volumes and a market for [[commercial software]].

An issue SIE as a vendor organisation is able to solve but a [[standards organisation]] ethics do not allow UN/CEFACT or XBRL to handle. SIE could be a key player here, supplying an applied instruction layer to XBRL GL (and UN/CEFACT accounting). But at the SIE year meeting 2013 after studying XBRL GL for a year, and a representative of XBRL GL international present at the meeting, the main members argued “who is the paying customer?” and the project of making a SIE XBRL GL implementation run into the sand.

There are a number of articles in the branch would press about very expensive XBRL projects with very sparse results of volume use. The contradiction between [[standards organisation]] ethics and applied technology (a common implementation instruction set) issues, is a hard thing to solve to make such projects more likely successful.

In 1992 SIE solved the issue for the [[SIE (file format)]] as a non-[[standards organisation]] vendor society. All members but one large vendor, agreed of a common implementation agreement, including an implementation instruction set, made it available for all in the market. All other (national, future and international) vendors in the domestic Swedish accounting related [[commercial software]] market had to by customer demand to follow, or not sell any volumes. Actually the existence of the common format showed the market very good arguments for the data producing users real strong benefits. Especially the interactivity in daily accounting between the company, accounting consultant and audit, being very rational and benefitted in possible daily information feedback. Benefits and features almost impossible to convince paying customers are possible before the features are actually available, and this is a huge commercial problem for XBRL GL and UN/CEFACT solve, not being a vendor interest group society. Interesting is that the start vision of SIE was about the same as XBRL, export from accounting of data to tax declaration commercial software. But it is possible to find special benefit points data for producers, and by it make them pay to get the features of the accounting standard file format, but it is a hard commercial design issue.

SIE however refuse to go international and refuse make further development steps (because large members claim at the 2013 year meeting they can’t see the paying customer of expensive SW development projects that will come out of it).

There is a general stand-off situation in this market field. And how XBRL will solve it, is the major future question?

==XBRL International's Global Ledger Taxonomy Framework==
'''XBRL GL''', the familiar name for XBRL International's Global Ledger Taxonomy Framework, is a series of modular taxonomies developed by XBRL International and a framework for its extension for representing the information found in a typical [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system using XML and the [[XBRL]] Specification''.

== Formal models and XBRL GL ==

XBRL GL is the modeling of the semantics of information found in ERP systems using the XBRL Specification. Additional efforts to reuse the semantic of the Global Ledger using other syntaxes are also being explored.

== Tax organization interest in XBRL GL ==

XBRL GL was designed to be generic and holistic, and serve as a bridge between transaction space and reporting. As such it has gained interest from many sectors, including tax administrators in [[OASIS (organization)]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). XBRL GL has been adopted by the Turkish government for the standard for electronic bookkeeping for tax purposes. XBRL GL uniquely can track and reconcile the book-tax differences found in direct taxation regimes, including permanent and timing differences.
