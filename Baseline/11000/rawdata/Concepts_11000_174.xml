'''Akrasia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|z|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀκρασία|ἀκρασία]]}}, "lacking command"), occasionally transliterated as '''acrasia''' or Anglicised as '''acrasy''' or '''acracy''', is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one's better judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ad6grll-ak&amp;t=339s?t=5m49s | title=College Info Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjectival form is "akratic".&lt;ref&gt;Although this philosopher's technical term is usually employed in its Greek form (i.e., '''akrasia'''/'''akratic''') in English texts, it was once the philosophers' English language convention to use the precise English equivalent of '''akrasia/akratic''', '''[[wikt:incontinence|incontinence]]'''/'''incontinent'''. However, it now seems that the correct, widely established convention is to use the term '''akrasia'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical approaches==
[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|Portrait in marble of [[Socrates]], who was an early investigator of akrasia]]
The problem goes back at least as far as Plato. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' [[Socrates]] asks precisely how it is possible that, ''if'' one judges action A to be the best course of action, one would do anything other than A?

In the [[dialogue]] ''Protagoras'', Socrates attests that akrasia does not exist, claiming "No one goes willingly toward the bad" (358d). If a person examines a situation and decides to act in the way he determines to be best, he will pursue this action, as the best course is also the good course, i.e. man's natural goal.  An all-things-considered assessment of the situation will bring full knowledge of a decision's outcome and worth linked to well-developed principles of the good. A person, according to Socrates, never chooses to act poorly or against his better judgment; and, therefore, actions that go against what is best are simply a product of being ignorant of facts or knowledge of what is best or good.

[[Aristotle]], on the other hand, took a more empirical approach to the question, acknowledging that we intuitively believe in akrasia. He distances himself from the Socratic position by locating the breakdown of reasoning in an agent’s opinion, not his [[appetition]]. Now, without recourse to appetitive desires, Aristotle reasons that akrasia occurs as a result of opinion. Opinion is formulated mentally in a way that may or may not imitate truth, while appetites are merely desires of the body. Thus, opinion is only incidentally aligned with or opposed to the good, making an akratic action the product of opinion instead of reason. For Aristotle, the antonym of ''akrasia'' is ''[[enkrateia]]'', which means "in power" (over oneself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Kraut|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''akrasia'' occurs twice in the [[Koine Greek]] [[New Testament]]. In {{Bibleverse|Matthew|23:25}} [[Jesus]] uses it to describe hypocritical religious leaders, translated "self-indulgence" in several translations, including the English Standard version. [[Paul the Apostle]] also gives the threat of temptation through akrasia as a reason for a husband and wife to not deprive each other of sex ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|7:5}}). In another passage (Rom. 7:15–25) Paul, without actually using the term ''akrasia'', seems to reference the same psychological phenomenon in discussing the internal conflict between, on the one hand, "the law of God," which he equates with "the law of my mind"; and "another law in my members," identified with "the flesh, the law of sin." "For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do." (v.19)

In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', book II, Acrasia, the embodiment of intemperance dwelling in the "Bower of Bliss", had the [[Circe]]-like capacity of transforming her lovers into monstrous animal shapes.

==Contemporary approaches==
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1969–1980) attempted to solve the problem by first criticizing earlier thinkers who wanted to limit the scope of akrasia to agents who despite having reached a [[Rational choice theory|rational decision]] were somehow swerved off their "desired" tracks.  Indeed, Davidson expands akrasia to include any judgment that is reached but not fulfilled, whether it be as a result of an opinion, a real or imagined good, or a moral belief. "[T]he puzzle I shall discuss depends only on the attitude or belief of the agent…my subject concerns evaluative judgments, whether they are analyzed cognitively, prescriptively, or otherwise."  Thus, he expands akrasia to include cases in which the agent seeks to fulfill desires, for example, but ends up denying himself the pleasure he has deemed most choice-worthy.

Davidson sees the problem as one of reconciling the following apparently [[inconsistent triad]]:
* If an agent believes A to be better than B, then they want to do A more than B.
* If an agent wants to do A more than B, then they will do A rather than B if they only do one.
* Sometimes an agent acts against their better judgment.

Davidson solves the problem by saying that, when people act in this way, they temporarily believe that the worse course of action is better, because they have not made an all-things-considered judgment, but only a judgment based on a subset of possible considerations.

Another contemporary philosopher, [[Amélie Rorty]] (1980) has tackled the problem by distilling out akrasia's many forms.  She contends that akrasia is manifested in different stages of the [[practical reasoning]] process. She enumerates four types of akrasia: akrasia of direction or aim, of interpretation, of irrationality, and of character.  She separates the practical reasoning process into four steps, showing the breakdown that may occur between each step and how each constitutes an akratic state.

Another explanation is that there are different forms of [[motivation]] which can conflict with each other. Throughout the ages, many have identified a conflict between [[reason]] and [[emotion]], which might make it possible to believe that one should do A rather than B, but still end up wanting to do B more than A.

Psychologist [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] argues that akrasia results from the empirically verified phenomenon of [[hyperbolic discounting]], which causes us to make different judgements close to a reward than we will when further from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Weakness of will==
Richard Holton (1999), argues that weakness of the will involves revising one's [[wikt:resolution|resolution]]s too easily. Under this view, it is possible to act against one's better judgment (that is, be akratic), but without being weak-willed. Suppose, for example, Sarah ''judges'' that taking revenge upon a murderer is not the best course of action, but makes the resolution to take revenge anyway and sticks to that resolution.  According to Holton, Sarah behaves akratically but does not show weakness of will. &lt;!-- holds to that intention? As in she does actually make an attempt on the murderer? --&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that the [[anal stage]] of childhood [[psychosexual development]] was marked by the predominance of anal eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexological==
Since the mid-twentieth century, English speaking sex manuals like ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' have acknowledged the erogenous sensitivity of the anus, and its role in love play.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, [[Alex Comfort]], recognised that [[anal intercourse]] was part of many heterosexual as well as homosexual relationships&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; (as indeed had Freud at the start of the century).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 64-5&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort also stressed the importance (in the French tradition) of [[postillionage]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)#Anal fingering|anal fingering]] prior to orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Some decades after Comfort, [[Margot Anand]] explored how liberating anal eroticism might contribute to [[peak experience]] in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 1-2 and p. 336-345&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental==
[[D. W. Winnicott]] would speak accordingly of "the tremendous pleasure that belongs to the doing of a motion just exactly when the impulse comes...another little orgy that enriches the life of the infant".&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud in his 1908 article ''Character and Anal Erotism'' argued that, through reaction formations and sublimation, anal eroticism could turn in later life into character traits such as obstinacy, orderliness and meanness.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 208-15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sándor Ferenczi]] extended his findings to cover the sublimation of anal eroticism into aesthetic experiences such as painting and sculpture, as well as into an interest in money.&lt;ref&gt;Sandor Ferenczi, 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money' in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 264-272&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] linked anal eroticism to feelings of [[disgust]], to [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], and to [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 139, 351 and 359-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Kristeva]] would subsequently explore anal eroticism in connection with her concept of [[abjection]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Restuccia, ''Melancholics in Love'' (2000) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atopy''' ([[greek language|Greek]] ''ατοπία, atopía - placelessness, unclassifiable, of high [[original]]ity''; [[Socrates]] has often been called "átopos") describes the [[ineffability]] of things or emotions that are seldom experienced, that are outstanding and that are original in the strict sense. The term depicts a certain quality (of experience) that can be observed within oneself or within others. It does not depict an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], although it has been abused to do so, for example by the ''genius-cult'' during the era of [[romanticism]].

== Phenomenon, origin ==

A human being in love, no matter at whom or what his adoration and affection is pointed at&amp;mdash;be it a beloved person, a god in some mystical sense or an idol&amp;mdash;is not able to reduce the "item" of his love down to certain [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s, he claims his "obscure object of desire" to be unique and incomparable.

The [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] of characteristics from the banal everyday world would, in the eye of the one being seriously in love, mean betrayal ([[sacrilege]]) to the very own love itself. Up until now, no one has managed to describe and analyze this more strikingly than [[Roland Barthes]] in his famous and acclaimed collection of [[essay]]s ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'', published in 1977. But if you look at it more closely, this is an everyday phenomenon each and every mere mortal is encountering: parents can describe, praise or curse the relation between them and their children&amp;mdash;but they realize at the same time that the depth and the profoundness of their feelings for their offspring are atopical, or ineffable.

Natural religions, like [[mysticism]], therefore talk about "[[Tao]]", about the "original" and the "pristine"; in the field of ontological philosophy and  theology it is called "richness of being". The rather sensual, mundane and secular poetry speaks of [[cornucopia]] (also see: [[cornucopian]]), or, more prosaically of "[[artistic inspiration|inspiration]]". In the field of science, especially in psychological sciences, this phenomenon is being researched under the leading definition of [[creativity]] or as [[Flow (psychology)|"Flow"]].

== Occurrence ==

Most adults are familiar with atopy, having experienced the view on the world through "rose-tinted glasses" in phases of [[limerence]]. Art lovers know it as [[genius]] and as something auratic, readers as "Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol" in [[Max Frisch]]'s "Stiller", which refers to the notion of God from the "Ten Commandments", or "Geschichten von Herrn Keuner" by [[Bertold Brecht]].

'''Billy Apple''' [[New Zealand Order of Merit|ONZM]] (born '''Barrie Bates'''&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Osterwold, ''Pop Art'', Taschen, 2003, p78. {{ISBN|3-8228-2070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 1935), is an artist whose work is associated with the New York and British schools of [[Pop Art]] in the 1960s and with the [[Conceptual Art]] movement in the 1970s. He collaborated with the likes of [[Andy Warhol]] and other pop artists. His work is part of the permanent collection of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] (New Zealand), Auckland Art Gallery / [[Toi o Tamak]]i (New Zealand), the [[Christchurch]] Art Gallery / [[Te Puna o Waiwhetu]] (New Zealand), [[The University of Auckland]] (New Zealand) and the SMAK/[[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst]] ([[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]).

== Barrie Bates ==

Barrie Bates was born in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 1935. He left secondary school with no qualifications and took a job as an assistant to a paint manufacturer in 1951. Bates attended evening classes at [[Elam School of Fine Arts]], where he met [[Robert Ellis (artist)|Robert Ellis]], a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in London.

In 1959, he left [[New Zealand]] on a National Art Gallery scholarship. He studied at the [[Royal College of Art]], London, from 1959 until 1962. During his time at the Royal College of Art, Bates met several other artists who went on to become a new generation of [[pop artists]]; including [[David Hockney]], [[Derek Boshier]] [[Frank Bowling]] and [[Pauline Boty]]. He exhibited frequently during his time at the College in the ''Young Contemporaries'' and ''Young Commonwealth Artists'' exhibitions along with Frank Bowling, Jonathan Kingdon, [[Bill Culbert]], Jan Bensemann and Jerry Pethick.

== Billy Apple ==

In 1962, Bates conceived '''Billy Apple''': he bleached his hair and eyebrows with Lady Clairol Instant Creme Whip and changed his name to Billy Apple. Apple had his first solo show in 1963 – ''Apple Sees Red: Live Stills'' – in London .

Apple moved to New York in 1964: he progressed his artistic career and also found work in various advertising agencies.

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit "The American Supermarket", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it – the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc. – was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, including Billy Apple, [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jasper Johns]], Mary Inman, [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]].

Apple was one of the artists who pioneered the use of [[neon sign|neon]] in art works.&lt;ref name="SquareTIME"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941980,00.html |title= A Times Square of the Mind |author= |work= [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date= 18 March 1966 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in the 1965 exhibitions ''Apples to Xerox'' and ''Neon Rainbows'', both at The Bianchini Gallery. Then in 1967, the exhibition ''Unidentified Fluorescent Objects'' (''UFOs''), which showed a collection of neon light sculptures, was held at the Howard Wise Gallery, a fore-runner to the organisation [[Electronic Arts Intermix]] (EAI).&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, Robin (March/April 2007). "Video Installation: Characteristics of an Expanding Medium". After Image 34 (5): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Apple's ''UFO'''s was included in a 2013 exhibition that reconsidered the influence of Howard Wise Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Howard Wise Gallery: Exploring the New |url=http://www.moellerfineart.com/exhibitions/2012-04-27_howard-wise-gallery-exploring-the-new/ |accessdate=12 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701143022/http://www.moellerfineart.com/exhibitions/2012-04-27_howard-wise-gallery-exploring-the-new/ |archivedate=1 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russeth|first=Andrew|title='Howard Wise: Exploring the New’ at Moeller Fine Art|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/04/howard-wise-exploring-the-new-at-moeller-fine-art/|work=GalleristNY|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the artist established ''Apple'', one of the first [[alternative exhibition space]]s in New York at 161 West Twenty-third Street in order, as he stated, "to provide an independent and experimental alternative space for the presentation of [his] own work and the work of others." Initially the exhibition space was part of his own studio. During its four years Apple produced 35 works in the venue and hosted work by other artists including [[Geoff Hendricks]], [[Mac Adams]], [[Davi Det Hompson]], [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]] and [[Jerry Vis]]. The space was considered both an exhibition space and a forum for art and discourse.

In 1974, Apple's first major survey exhibition was held at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London: ''From Barrie Bates to Billy Apple''. In 1975 Apple returned to New Zealand for the first time in sixteen years. During the visit he embarked on a national exhibition tour with support from the [[Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council]]. Apple was then invited back by the Arts Council for a tour over the summer of 1979–1980. The exhibition he toured was called ''The Given as an Art Political Statement''. During each tour he exhibited in spaces throughout the country.

During the 1980s, Apple's practice focused on the economics of the art world. The exhibition ''Art for Sale'' at Peter Webb gallery in 1980 was made up of a series of art works that were actual receipts for the payment given to the artist. This work progressed on to a series called ''Transactions''. Other important series of work that began in the 1980s include ''Golden Rectangle'' series, and ''From the Collection''. In 1983 he produced a solid gold apple for former Auckland Coin &amp; Bullion Exchange Director, Ray Smith, valued at $(NZ)85,000 – the most expensive work made by a living New Zealander at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifford|first=Andrew|title=Tales of Gold: The Tale of Ray, at Artspace|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3572707|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=NZ Herald|date=16 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant precursor to [[Damien Hirst]]'s 2007 diamond skull titled [[For the Love of God]]. The gold apple was later exhibited at Artspace, Auckland in 2004 as part of an installation developed with regular collaborator and writer, Wystan Curnow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tales of Gold, Billy Apple with Wystan Curnow |url=http://www.artspace.org.nz/exhibitions/2004/billyapple.asp |work=Artspace |publisher=Artspace |accessdate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209134441/http://artspace.org.nz/exhibitions/2004/billyapple.asp |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to New Zealand, permanently in 1990 and currently lives in Auckland. In 1991 the Wellington City Art Gallery staged a decade survey of his work: ''As Good as Gold: Billy Apple Art Transactions 1981–1991''. Negotiations are underway between [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and the New Zealand horticulture research centre to develop an apple that could be named "Billy Apple". In 2001 Apple created a company, "Billy Apple Ltd" in anticipation of securing licensing of the marketing rights over this new apple.

The artist has a long-standing interest and involvement in motor racing, which was acknowledged with the inclusion of two vehicles from his own collection in the 1991 ''As Good as Gold'' survey, as well as in the accompanying publication.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Burke, "Exchange Value", in ''As Good As Gold: Billy Apple Art Transactions 1981–1991'' (Wellington: Wellington City Art Gallery, 1991), 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; This interest was brought to the fore with ''The Art Circuit'', a sound performance work incorporating famous bikes and riders staged on the Auckland Art Gallery forecourt in 2007. This was followed by the 2008 solo exhibition, ''The Bruce and Denny Show'',&lt;ref&gt;http://tworooms.co.nz/exhibitions/the-bruce-and-denny-show/&lt;/ref&gt; presented at Two Rooms in 2008 as a tribute to the [[McLaren Group|McLaren brand]], and particularly to the motoring triumphs of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Denny Hulme]] from 1967–1969. The exhibition included Hulme's $1.5 million McLaren M8A-2 racing car and text works that make reference to the tracks raced and the livery of the two drivers' cars.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Clifford, "Billy Apple" in ''Art World'' Issue 4 August/September 2008, 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Apple was the subject of a feature-length documentary called "Being Billy Apple".  Produced by Spacific Films and directed by award winning filmmaker, [[Leanne Pooley]], the documentary tells the story of Billy Apple's life from his POP period through his involvement with the conceptual art movement in New York during the 1970s to his current "horticultural/art" Apple endeavours.

In 2009, the [[Adam Art Gallery, Wellington]] staged the survey exhibition ''Billy Apple: New York 1969–1973'', covering the activities undertaken by the artist in the not-for-profit gallery he ran from 161 West 23rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adamartgallery.org.nz/past-exhibitions/new-york-1969-1973/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009 [[Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art]] in Amsterdam presented a major exhibition in two parts, curated by [[Nicolaus Schafhausen]]; the first ''Billy Apple: A History of the Brand'', surveys the artist's entire practice from inception as his own brand to the present day;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdw.nl/event/billy-apple-a-history-of-the-brand/&lt;/ref&gt; the second, ''Revealed/Concealed'', focuses on his works that critique the site of art through architectural interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdw.nl/event/billy-apple-revealedconcealed/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920101306/http://www.wdw.nl/event/billy-apple-revealedconcealed/ |archivedate=20 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''blesbok''' or '''blesbuck''' (''Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi'') is an [[antelope]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[South Africa]]. It has a distinctive white face and forehead which inspired the name, because ''bles'' is the [[Afrikaans]] word for a [[Wiktionary:blaze|blaze]] such as one might see on the forehead of a horse.

==Affinities and status==
The blesbok and the [[bontebok]] (''Damaliscus pygargus dorcas'') are variant subspecies of one another and can readily interbreed, the offspring being known as the bontebles or baster blesbok, the differences between the two subspecies have arisen due to preferences for different habitats in the wild. The blesbok is endemic to southern Africa and is found in large numbers in all national parks with open grasslands, from the [[Highveld]] north of the [[Vaal river]] southwards through the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], to the [[Eastern Cape]]. It is a plains species and dislikes wooded areas. It was first discovered in the 17th century, in numbers so numerous, herds reached from horizon to horizon.&lt;ref name = RGC&gt;Gordon-Cumming, Roualeyn. Five Years of a Hunter's Life in the Far Interior of South Africa. Publisher: J. Murray. ca 1850. May be downloaded from: https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Roualeyn+Gordon+-Cumming%22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Blesbok sa 2003.jpg|left|thumb|Juvenile blesboks]]
Physically, rams and ewes are remarkably similar. Their mass can be as much as 85&amp;nbsp;kg. A characteristic of the blesbok is the prominent white blaze on the face and a horizontal brown strip which divides this blaze above the eyes. Body colour is brown with a lighter-coloured saddle on the back, and the rump an even lighter shade. The legs are brown with a white patch behind the top part of the front legs. Lower legs whitish. Both sexes carry horns, ringed almost to the tip. Female horns are slightly more slender. The neck and the top of the back of the blesbok is brown. Lower down on the flanks and buttocks, the coloring becomes darker. The belly, the inside of the buttocks and the area up to the base of the tail is white. Blesbok can be easily differentiated from other antelopes because they have a distinct white face and forehead. The blesbok differs from the bontebok by having less white on the coat and the blaze on the face, which is usually divided, the coat is also a lighter yellow than that of the bontebok. The length of their [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] averages at around 38&amp;nbsp;cm. Male adult blesbok average around 70&amp;nbsp;kg; females average lower, at around 61&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pistoleros.no/animals/blesbuck/1.htm Blesbuck] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928161019/http://www.pistoleros.no/animals/blesbuck/1.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
Blesbok can be found in open [[veld]] or plains of South Africa and Namibia. Their preferred habitat is open grassland with water. They often occupy relatively small territories of 2.5 to 6.0 acres in size.
They were once one of the most abundant antelope species of the African plains, but have become scarce since 1893 due to relentless hunting for their skins and meat.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Damalicus pygargus phillipsi Dvur zoo 2.jpg|thumb|rught|250 px|ZOO Dvůr Králové, Czech Republic]]

The blesbok is a seasonal breeder, with [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]ting from March to May. Births peak during November and December after a gestation period of about 240 days (8 months). Females give birth to a single calf per breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_blesbok.html Kruger Park: Blesbok]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The blesbok was hunted nearly to extinction because of its large numbers, but having been protected since the late 19th century, it has proliferated and today it is sufficiently numerous not to be classed as endangered. In modern times, this is largely because of the commercial value of the blesbok to private land owners, and also because it is one of the few medium-sized antelope that can be contained by normal stock fencing.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} At the start of the 21st century, blesbok numbers are stable, estimated to be around 240,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/30208/0&lt;/ref&gt; However, 97% of them live outside reserves, and only 3% in national parks. They also are common in zoos, though in far smaller numbers.

==Predators==
[[Human]]s, [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[African wild dog]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s are the blesbok's main predators, while [[jackal]]s and [[eagle]]s may attack the calves. The blesbok is both farmed and hunted for the skin, meat, and trophy. Blesbok are shy and alert; they rely on speed and endurance to escape predators, but have an tendency to return to place where they were attacked after a few minutes. They can maintain a speed of {{convert|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} when chased, but, like other white-fronted damalisques, blesbok are not good jumpers or crawlers.

==Paleontology==
Fossil remains of a prehistoric relative, ''Damaliscus niro'', were found in deposits in [[Sterkfontein]]. With a weight of approximately 120&amp;nbsp;kg, it was heavier than the modern blesbok and it had slightly different horns. ''D. niro'' became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene 12 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Brett Hilton-Barber, Lee R.

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, also known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].

The three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microscopes==

[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope from the 17th century with a magnification of 300x.

[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscope]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

Extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. Later in the 1920s, the [[electron microscope]] was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]]. In this book, he gave 60 ‘observations’ in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named "cells". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe “seeds” that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"/&gt; Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these “animalcules,” which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt; Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J.H.F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|Schwann Theodore| [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells

2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archivedate = 2015-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==
The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Modern version ==
The modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:

*Heredity information ([[DNA]]) is passed on from cell to cell.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
*All cells have the same basic chemical composition.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle &amp; Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter &amp; Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks &amp; Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]
===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.&lt;ref name=w11&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s). The [[protoplasm]] of a prokaryote contains the chromosomal region that appears as [[fibrous]] deposits under the microscope, and the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=w11/&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] are the  two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes.
# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'': Eukaryotic cells are also surrounded by the plasma membrane, but  on the other hand, they  have distinct nuclei bound by a [[nuclear membrane]] or envelope. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as  ([[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[vacuoles]]).&lt;ref name=w13&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43515">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], a '''copula''' is a multivariate probability distribution for which the [[marginal probability]] distribution of each variable is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]]. Copulas are used to describe the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependence]] between [[random variable]]s. Their name comes from the Latin for "link" or "tie", similar but unrelated to grammatical [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] in [[linguistics]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.  Copulas have been used widely in quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk&lt;ref name="Banking 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Alcock|first2=J.|last3=Faff|first3=R.|last4=Brailsford|first4=T.|title=Canonical vine copulas in the context of modern portfolio management: Are they worth it?|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|date=2013|volume=37|issue=8|doi= 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portfolio optimization applications.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abe Sklar|Sklar]]'s theorem states that any multivariate [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint distribution]] can be written in terms of univariate [[marginal distribution|marginal-distribution]] functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables.

Copulas are popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.

Two-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name ''permutons'' and ''doubly-stochastic measures''.

==Mathematical definition==
Consider a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal [[Cumulative distribution function|CDFs]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(x) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x] &lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions. By applying the [[probability integral transform]] to each component, the random vector
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)=\left(F_1(X_1),F_2(X_2),\dots,F_d(X_d)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
has [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed marginals.

The copula of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint cumulative distribution function]] of &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[U_1\leq u_1,U_2\leq u_2,\dots,U_d\leq u_d] .&lt;/math&gt;

The copula ''C'' contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; contain all information on the marginal distributions.

The importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate [[pseudo-random]] samples from general classes of [[multivariate probability distribution]]s. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt; from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) = \left(F_1^{-1}(U_1),F_2^{-1}(U_2),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The inverses &lt;math&gt;F_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are unproblematic as the &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\dots,X_d\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)] .&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

In [[probability theory|probabilistic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if ''C'' is a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of a ''d''-dimensional random vector on the [[unit cube]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; with [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[marginal distribution|marginals]].&lt;ref name="nelsen"&gt;{{Citation |first=Roger B. |last=Nelsen |year=1999 |title=An Introduction to Copulas |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-98623-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Multivariable calculus|analytic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if
:* &lt;math&gt;C(u_1,\dots,u_{i-1},0,u_{i+1},\dots,u_d)=0 &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is zero if one of the arguments is zero,
:*  &lt;math&gt;C(1,\dots,1,u,1,\dots,1)=u &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is equal to ''u'' if one argument is ''u'' and all others 1,
:* ''C'' is ''d''-non-decreasing, i.e., for each [[hyperrectangle]] &lt;math&gt;B=\prod_{i=1}^{d}[x_i,y_i]\subseteq [0,1]^d &lt;/math&gt; the ''C''-volume of ''B'' is non-negative:
:*:&lt;math&gt; \int_B dC(u) =\sum_{\mathbf z\in \times_{i=1}^{d}\{x_i,y_i\}} (-1)^{N(\mathbf z)} C(\mathbf z)\ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;
::where the &lt;math&gt;N(\mathbf z)=\#\{k : z_k=x_k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, in the bivariate case, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a bivariate copula if &lt;math&gt;C(0,u) = C(u,0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(1,u) = C(u,1) = u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq u_1 \leq u_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq v_1 \leq v_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sklar's theorem==
[[File:Gaussian copula gaussian marginals.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution]]
[[File:Biv gumbel dist.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula]]

Sklar's theorem,&lt;ref name="Sklar 1959"&gt;{{citation | last=Sklar | first=A. | authorlink = Abe Sklar | title=Fonctions de répartition à n dimensions et leurs marges | journal=Publ. Inst. Statist. Univ. Paris | year=1959 | volume=8 | pages=229–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Abe Sklar]], provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.
Sklar's theorem states that every [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|multivariate cumulative distribution function]]
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq x_1,\dots,X_d\leq x_d]&lt;/math&gt;
of a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of its marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i(x_i) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x_i] &lt;/math&gt; and
a copula &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d) = C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right). &lt;/math&gt;

In case that the multivariate distribution has a density &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and this is available, it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\dots,x_d)= c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdot\dots\cdot f_d(x_d),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the copula.

The theorem also states that, given &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the copula is unique on &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Ran}(F_1)\times\cdots\times \operatorname{Ran}(F_d) &lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[cartesian product]] of the [[Range (mathematics)|ranges]] of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are continuous.

The converse is also true: given a copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; and margins &lt;math&gt;F_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right)&lt;/math&gt; defines a ''d''-dimensional cumulative distribution function.

==Fréchet–Hoeffding copula bounds==
[[File:copule ord.svg|thumb|right|Graphs of the bivariate Fréchet–Hoeffding copula limits and of the independence copula (in the middle).]]

The Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem (after [[Maurice René Fréchet]] and [[Wassily Hoeffding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hoeffding.html |title=Biography of Wassily Hoeffding |author="J J O'Connor and E F Robertson" |date= March 2011 |publisher= School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that for any Copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;(u_1,\dots,u_d)\in[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; the following bounds hold:
: &lt;math&gt;W(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq C(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq M(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''W''' is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; W(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \max\left\{1-d+\sum\limits_{i=1}^d {u_i} , 0 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''M''' is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; M(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \min \{u_1,\dots,u_d\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound is sharp: ''M'' is always a copula, it corresponds to [[comonotonicity|comonotone random variables]].

The lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed '''u''', there is a copula &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}(u) = W(u)&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''W'' is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables.

In two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem states
: &lt;math&gt;\max(u+v-1,0) \leq C(u,v) \leq \min\{u,v\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Families of copulas==

Several families of copulas have been described.

===Gaussian copula===
[[File:Copula gaussian.svg|thumb|Cumulative and density distribution of Gaussian copula with ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4]]

The Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit cube &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt;. It is constructed from a [[multivariate normal distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; by using the [[probability integral transform]].

For a given [[correlation matrix]] &lt;math&gt;R\in[-1, 1]^{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u) = \Phi_R\left(\Phi^{-1}(u_1),\dots, \Phi^{-1}(u_d) \right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_R&lt;/math&gt; is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, &lt;math&gt;C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be upper or lower bounded, and  approximated using numerical integration.&lt;ref name="bo16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botev|first1=Z. I.|title=The normal law under linear restrictions: simulation and estimation via minimax tilting|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B|date=2016|doi=10.1111/rssb.12162|arxiv=1603.04166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=TruncatedNormal|title=TruncatedNormal: Truncated Multivariate Normal|first=Zdravko I.|last=Botev|date=10 November 2015|publisher=|via=R-Packages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density can be written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philipp |last=Arbenz |year=2013 |title=Bayesian Copulae Distributions, with Application to Operational Risk Management—Some Comments |journal=Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=105–108 |doi=10.1007/s11009-011-9224-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det{R}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}^T \cdot
\left(R^{-1}-I\right) \cdot
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}
\right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix.

===Archimedean copulas===

Archimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula.
In practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence.

A copula '''C''' is called Archimedean if it admits the representation&lt;ref name="Nelsen 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelsen |first=R. B. |year=2006 |title=An Introduction to Copulas, Second Edition |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media Inc. |location=New York, NY 10013, USA |isbn=978-1-4419-2109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C(u_1,\dots,u_d;\theta) = \psi^{[-1]}\left(\psi(u_1;\theta)+\cdots+\psi(u_d;\theta);\theta\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi\!:[0,1]\times\Theta \rightarrow [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that &lt;math&gt;\psi(1;\theta)=0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter within some parameter space &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called generator function and &lt;math&gt;\psi^{[-1]}&lt;/math&gt; is its pseudo-inverse defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \psi^{[-1]}(t;\theta) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \psi^{-1}(t;\theta) &amp; \mbox{if }0 \leq t \leq \psi(0;\theta) \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if }\psi(0;\theta) \leq t \leq\infty. \end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the above formula for '''C''' yields a copula for &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[d-monotone function|d-monotone]] on &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNeil |first=A.

That is, if it is &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\psi^{-1,(k)}(t;\theta) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\dots,d-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{d-2}\psi^{-1,(d-2)}(t;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is nonincreasing and [[convex function|convex]].

====Most important Archimedean copulas====

The following tables highlight the most prominent bivariate Archimedean copulas, with their corresponding generator. Note that not all of them are [[completely monotone function|completely monotone]], i.e. ''d''-monotone for all &lt;math&gt;d\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or ''d''-monotone for certain &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt; only.

==Expectation for copula models and Monte Carlo integration==

In statistical applications, many problems can be formulated in the following way. One is interested in the expectation of a response function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; applied to some random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. McNeil, Rudiger Frey and Paul Embrechts (2005) "Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques, and Tools", Princeton Series in Finance&lt;/ref&gt; If we denote the cdf of this random vector with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity of interest can thus be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{E}\left[ g(X_1,\dots,X_d) \right] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(x_1,\dots,x_d) \,  dH(x_1,\dots,x_d).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is given by a copula model, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=C(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))&lt;/math&gt;

this expectation can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d)) \, dC(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;

In case the copula '''C''' is [[absolutely continuous]], i.e. '''C''' has a density '''c''', this equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d))\cdot c(u_1,\dots,u_d) \, du_1\cdots du_d,&lt;/math&gt;
and if each marginal distribution has the density &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}g(x_1,\dots x_d)\cdot c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdots f_d(x_d) \, dx_1\cdots dx_d.&lt;/math&gt;

If copula and margins are known (or if they have been estimated), this expectation can be approximated through the following Monte Carlo algorithm:
# Draw a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1^k,\dots,U_d^k)\sim C\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt; of size '''n''' from the copula '''C'''
# By applying the inverse marginal cdf's, produce a sample of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)=(F_1^{-1}(U_1^k),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d^k))\sim H\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt;
# Approximate &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]&lt;/math&gt; by its empirical value:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n g(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)&lt;/math&gt;

==Empirical copulas==

When studying multivariate data, one might want to investigate the underlying copula. Suppose we have observations
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1^i,X_2^i,\dots,X_d^i), \, i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
from a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; with continuous margins. The corresponding "true" copula observations would be
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1^i,U_2^i,\dots,U_d^i)=\left(F_1(X_1^i),F_2(X_2^i),\dots,F_d(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
However, the marginal distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions
:&lt;math&gt;F_k^n(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^i\leq x)&lt;/math&gt;
instead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(\tilde{U}_1^i,\tilde{U}_2^i,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i)=\left(F_1^n(X_1^i),F_2^n(X_2^i),\dots,F_d^n(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding empirical copula is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;C^n(u_1,\dots,u_d) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}\left(\tilde{U}_1^i\leq u_1,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i\leq u_d\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\tilde{U}_k^i=R_k^i/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R_k^i&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of the observation &lt;math&gt;X_k^i&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_k^i=\sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^j\leq X_k^i)&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.

In [[quantitative finance]] copulas are applied to [[risk management]], to [[investment management|portfolio management]] and [[portfolio optimization|optimization]], and to [[derivatives pricing]].

For the former, copulas are used to perform [[Stress test (financial)|stress-tests]] and robustness checks that are especially important during "downside/crisis/panic regimes" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008).  The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on [[Securitization|pools of loans or bonds]].

During a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a [[flight-to-quality]] effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.

Copulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the [[marginal distribution|marginals]] and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to [[herd behavior|herd their trading behaviour and decisions]]. (See also [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)

The users of the formula have been criticized for creating "evaluation cultures" that continued to use simple copulæ despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "MacKenzieSpears"&gt;{{cite techreport |last1= MacKenzie |first1= Donald |last2= Spears |first2= Taylor |title= "The Formula That Killed Wall Street"?

However, the recent development of [[vine copula]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=R.M.|last2=Joe|first2=H.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Dependence Modeling Vine Copula Handbook|date= January 2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn= 978-981-4299-87-9|pages=37–72|url=http://rogermcooke.net/rogermcooke_files/Vines%20Arise%20Handbook%20VCM.pdf|editor1-last=Kurowicka|editor1-first=D.|editor2-last=Joe|editor2-first=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as pair copulas) enables the flexible modelling of the dependence structure for portfolios of large dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Clayton canonical vine copula allows for the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in [[portfolio optimization]] and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of [[financial panic|panic regimes]] on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|Monte Carlo simulation]], mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As regards [[derivatives pricing]], dependence modelling with copula functions is widely used in applications of [[Financial risk modeling|financial risk assessment]] and [[actuarial analysis]] – for example in the pricing of [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Meneguzzo|first1=David|title=Copula sensitivity in collateralized debt obligations and basket default swaps|date=Nov 2003|journal=[[Journal of Futures Markets]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=37–70|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|doi=10.1002/fut.10110|id=|quote=|last2=Vecchiato|first2=Walter|authorlink=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-10-29 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the methodology of applying the Gaussian copula to [[credit derivative]]s to be one of the reasons behind the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street] ''Wired'', 2/23/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Despite this perception, there are documented attempts within the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the limitations of the Gaussian copula and of copula functions more generally, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics.  The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns.  Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of [[extreme value theory|extreme events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Solar irradiance variability===
Copulas have been used to estimate the solar irradiance variability in spatial networks and temporally for single locations.

== Notes ==

* This article uses the standard notation [[ISO 80000-2]], which supersedes [[ISO 31-11#Coordinate systems|ISO 31-11]], for [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (other sources may reverse the definitions of ''θ'' and ''φ''):
** The  polar angle is denoted by ''θ'': it is the angle between the ''z''-axis and the radial vector connecting the origin to the point in question.
** The [[azimuth|azimuthal angle]]  is denoted by ''φ'': it is the angle between the ''x''-axis and the projection of the radial vector onto the ''xy''-plane.
* The function {{nowrap|[[atan2]](''y'', ''x'')}} can be used instead of the mathematical function {{nowrap|[[arctan]](''y''/''x'')}} owing to its [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. The classical arctan function has an image of {{nowrap|(−π/2, +π/2)}}, whereas atan2 is defined to have an image of {{nowrap|(−π, π]}}.

== Unit vector conversion formula ==
The unit vector of a coordinate parameter u is defined in such a way that a small positive change in u causes the position vector '''&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;''' to change in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\partial\boldsymbol\vec{r} \over \partial u}={\partial{s} \over \partial u}{\boldsymbol\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; where s is the arc length parameter.

For two sets of coordinate systems &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;, according to [[Differential of a function|chain rule]], &lt;math&gt;d\boldsymbol\vec{r}=\sum_{i}{\partial{\boldsymbol\vec{r}}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}du_i=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}dv_j=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}\sum_{i}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}du_i&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let all of &lt;math&gt;du_i=0&lt;/math&gt; but one and then divide both sides by the corresponding differential of that coordinate parameter, we find:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19398">'''Due process''' is the legal requirement that the state must respect all [[legal rights]] that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of [[law of the land]] and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the [[rule of law]].

[[File:Attorney General Seal Variant.jpg|thumb|right|A variant of [[Lady Justice]] used in [[California Department of Justice|California]], wherein the blindfold covering her eyes represents the due process of law]]

Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting [[law]]s and [[legal process|legal proceedings]] (see [[substantive due process]]) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of [[natural justice]], and [[procedural justice]] used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.
The term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"&gt;Geoffrey Marshall, "Due Process in England", in ''Nomos XVIII: Due Process'', eds. J. Roland Pennock &amp; John W. Chapman, 69–92 (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref
name="Marshall, 69–70"&gt;Marshall, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due process developed from clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]] in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5bfrag1_user.html| title = CRS Annotated Constitution: Due Process| accessdate = June 30, 2014
| publisher = Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the [[US Constitution]].

==By jurisdiction==

===Magna Carta===
In clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]], issued in 1215, [[John of England]] promised: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."&lt;ref name="Magna"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta (1215)]&lt;/ref&gt; Magna Carta itself immediately became part of the "[[law of the land]]", and Clause 61 of that charter authorized an elected body of 25 barons to determine by majority vote what redress the King must provide when the King offends "in any respect against any man."&lt;ref name="Magna"/&gt; Thus, Magna Carta established the [[rule of law]] in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land. However, in the 13th century, the provisions may have been referring only to the rights of landowners, and not to ordinary peasantry or villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKechnie |first=William Sharp |title=Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John |publisher=Robert MacLehose and Co., Ltd. |year=1905 |location=Glasgow |pages=136–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCWIAAAAMAAJ}}: "The question must be considered an open one; but much might be said in favor of the opinion that 'freeman' as used in the Charter is synonymous with 'freeholder'...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter versions of Magna Carta were subsequently issued by British [[monarchs]], and Clause 39 of Magna Carta was renumbered "29."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html The Text of Magna Carta (1297)]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''due process of law'' first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of [[Edward III of England]], as follows: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;28 Edw. 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608, the English jurist [[Edward Coke]] wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta. Coke explained that no man shall be deprived but by ''legem terrae'', the law of the land, "that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England.... (that is, to speak it once and for all) by the due course, and process of law.."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/18th/coke2nd1797/coke2nd1797_051-100.pdf 2 ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' 46 (1608)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the clause in Magna Carta and the later statute of 1354 were again explained in 1704 (during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]) by the [[King's Bench|Queen's Bench]], in the case of ''Regina v. Paty''.&lt;ref name="paty"&gt;''Regina v. Paty'', 92 Eng. Rep. 232, 234 (1704) reprinted in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SA4wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1108&amp;lpg=PA1108&amp;dq=%22not+confined+to+the+common+law+but+takes+in+all+the+other+laws+which+are+in+force+in+this+realm%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TXaUQaHu_X&amp;sig=x3B0WSlbDv2Y0HufHcrZAfneS6U Reports of Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas: In the Reigns of the Late King William, Queen Anne, King George the First, and King George the Second]'', Vol. 2, pp. 1105, 1108.(1792).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the [[British House of Commons]] had deprived John Paty and certain other citizens of the right to vote in an election and committed them to [[Newgate Prison]] merely for the offense of pursuing a legal action in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Julius Medly, [https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22julius+medley%22+and+%22Manual+of+english+constitutional+history%22+and+1902&amp;as_brr=1 ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History'' 613 (1902)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's Bench, in an opinion by Justice Powys,{{clarification needed|date=January 2018|reason=Finding for which party?}} explained the meaning of "due process of law" as follows:
{{quote|[I]t is objected, that by Mag. Chart. c. 29, no man ought to be taken or imprisoned, but by the law of the land. But to this I answer, that lex terrae is not confined to the common law, but takes in all the other laws, which are in force in this realm; as the civil and canon law.... By the 28 Ed. 3, c. 3, there the words lex terrae, which are used in Mag. Char. are explained by the words, due process of law; and the meaning of the statute is, that all commitments must be by a legal authority; and the law of Parliament is as much a law as any, nay, if there be any superiority this is a superior law.&lt;ref name="paty"/&gt;}}

[[John Holt (judge)|Chief Justice Holt]] dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority. The House of Commons had purported to legislate unilaterally, without approval of the [[British House of Lords]], ostensibly to regulate the election of its members.&lt;ref&gt;George Godfrey Cunningham,[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22John+Paty%2C+and+four+others%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=1 4 ''Lives of Eminent and Illustrious Englishmen'' 54 (1835)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Queen's Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process, John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] Parliament.

===English law and American law diverge===

Throughout centuries of British history, many laws and treatises asserted various requirements as being part of "due process" or included in the "law of the land". That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law, rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself. As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has explained, a due process requirement in Britain was not "essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used."&lt;ref name="caselaw1"&gt;''Hurtado v. California'', {{ussc|110|516|1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the scattered references to "due process of law" in [[English law]] did not limit the power of the government; in the words of American law professor [[John V. Orth]], "the great phrases failed to retain their vitality."&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth, ''Due Process of Law: A Brief History'' ([[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence, KS]]: University Press of Kansas, 2003), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Orth points out that this is generally attributed to the rise of the doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] in the United Kingdom, which was accompanied by hostility towards [[judicial review]] as an undemocratic foreign invention.&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have occasionally interpreted Lord Coke's ruling in ''[[Dr. Bonham's Case]]'' as implying the possibility of judicial review, but by the 1870s, [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] was dismissing judicial review as "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham's Case..., a conundrum [that] ought to have been laughed at."&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lacking the power of judicial review, English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that it is nearly impossible for the legislative branch to overrule the Court's constitutional interpretations in ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997): "By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field."&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, English law and American law diverged.  Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law.  In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.

In 1977, an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term 'due process of law' in the general body of English legal writing.... Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury's ''Laws of England'', in Stephen's ''Commentaries'', or Anson's ''Law and Custom of the Constitution.'' The phrase rates no entry in such works as Stroud's ''Judicial Dictionary'' or Wharton's ''Law Lexicon.''&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two similar concepts in contemporary English law are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"/&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American conception of due process, which presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69–70"/&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Due Process Clause}}
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]] each contain a [[Due Process Clause]]. Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law.&lt;ref name="PAMadisonDPC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Madison |first=P. A. |title=Historical Analysis of the Meaning of the 14th Amendment's First Section |url=http://www.federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm#due |publisher=The Federalist Blog |accessdate=19 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] interprets the clauses as providing four protections: [[procedural due process]] (in civil and criminal proceedings), [[substantive due process]], a prohibition against [[void for vagueness|vague]] laws, and as the vehicle for the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].

===Others===
Various countries recognize some form of due process under [[custom (law)|customary]] [[international law]]. Although the specifics are often unclear, most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness. Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own [[citizens]], the doctrine of [[national treatment]], which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government. With the growth of [[international human rights law]] and the frequent use of [[treaty|treaties]] to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad, the distinction, in practice, between these two perspectives may be disappearing.

In [[sociology]], the '''East–West dichotomy''' is the perceived difference between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] worlds. [[culture|Cultural]] rather than [[geography|geographical]] in division, the boundaries of East and West are not fixed, but vary according to the criteria adopted by individuals using the term. Historically, [[Asia]] (excluding Siberia) was regarded as the East, and [[Europe]] was regarded as the West. Today, the "West" usually refers to [[Australasia]], [[Europe]], and [[Americas|America]]. Used in discussing such studies as [[management]], [[economics]], [[international relations]], and [[linguistics]], the concept is criticized for overlooking regional [[hybridity]].

== Divisions ==
Conceptually, the boundaries are cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West (despite being geographically in the east), while Islamic nations are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are a few Muslim-majority regions in Europe which do not fit this dichotomy.{{fact|date=November 2018}} The culture line can be particularly difficult to place in regions of cultural diversity such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], whose citizens may themselves identify as East or West depending on ethnic or religious background.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Further, residents of different parts of the world perceive the boundaries differently; for example, some European scholars define [[Russia]] as East, but most agree that it is the West's second complementary part,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/616571/Metaphorical_politics_Is_Russia_western&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic nations regard it and other predominantly [[Christian]] nations as the West.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Another unanswered question is whether Siberia (North Asia) is "Eastern" or "Western."

==Historical contrast between East and West==

During the [[Middle Ages]], there were many different types of civilizations that were comparable in some ways, but contrast each other in other ways. The Eastern civilizations and empires of the West are not comparable because of [[social class]] system, the way of making money and leadership. Special jobs for the people caused the rift between the East and West to grow, it was the difference between [[feudalism]] and the Eastern social system, the difference between [[trade]] and [[agriculture]] and the difference between the stability of government. The West and the Eastern Civilizations are not only different because of where they are, but also because of their social class system, the way of making money and leadership.&lt;ref name=ganshof&gt;[[François Louis Ganshof]] (1944). ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité''.  Translated into English by [[Philip Grierson]] as ''Feudalism'', with a foreword by [[F. M. Stenton]], 1st ed.: New York and London, 1952; 2nd ed: 1961; 3d ed: 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[daily life]] of the common people in the West and the Eastern Civilizations differed greatly based on how their society was run, and what it was focused on. One of the major differences between the West and the Eastern Civilizations was feudalism and [[manorialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment" ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''32'''.4 (December 1972:938–944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, "The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''31''' (December 1971:777–803).&lt;/ref&gt; They both shaped the [[social hierarchy]] and the overall life of the common person in the East. The manorial system was set up with a lord at the top who owned a large amount of land. He had [[serfs]] and [[peasants]] that he employed, the peasants in exchange for the land they got, for working, paid a rent of crop to the lord. This feudal society was every man for himself and did not help in the expansion of a civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stubbs]]. ''The Constitutional History of England''. Oxford: 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[social system]] of the West and East were different. [[Mongolia]] rose from [[nomad]]ic tribes united by [[Genghis Khan]]. He conquered much of the surrounding land and created a large empire. They would give the defenders a choice to either join them or die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Saunders|first = John Joseph|title = History of the Mongol Conquests|year = 2001|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 0-8122-1766-7|orig-year = First published 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This brutal mentality was shown when they conquered the vast majority of Asia and some of Europe and the Middle East. One thing that set the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]] apart was their increased social mobility. They had a series of tests that could be taken to better social status. Instead of the high-ranking positions being exclusively for the [[aristocrat]]s, they were easier for the poor to gain access to. In the West, it was harder to move up or down in the social classes, but in Eastern Civilizations, mobility was possible. In China, it was possible to move up in social status through tests and, in Mongolia it was possible to gain rank in the army through military skill because the society was based on its military prowess.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han|first=Mark Edward|last=Lewis|publisher=Belknap Press|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-0-674-02477-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West and the Eastern civilizations differed politically because the common people of the East were not always content with their leadership. While the West had many rulers in a short period of time, there was no [[Civil unrest|unrest]] with the people. Eastern civilizations had [[rebellion]]s and long gaps between rulers that caused unrest. In [[England]], there was a major war for the [[throne]] that lasted for almost a century. During a major war in the 14th and [[15th century]], England had many struggles for the throne that lead to much bloodshed. [[France]] also had problems in their government. Throughout all of this, England was still able to fight the French and almost win in the [[Hundred Years War]]. In Eastern civilizations the government was not always stable.&lt;ref&gt;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, ''Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, one of the deadliest events in human history occurred during the Tang dynasty. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] was very bloody and shows the instability in the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Adams|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Hall|first3=Thomas D | title = East-West Orientation of Historical Empires | journal = Journal of world-systems research|date=December 2006 |volume=12|issue=2 |page=222 |url =http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/369/381 |issn= 1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, the West and the Eastern civilizations were drastically different because of how they acquired money. In China, one of the major economic factors was the trade. They were connected to Europe with the [[Silk Road]], this was a series of trade routes from [[East Asia]] to Europe. The Silk Road was not only used to trade [[goods]], it was also a place for trading ways of thought or religion. The [[English people|English]] employed a special type of feudalism called [[bastard feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Livery and Maintenance'', ''Encyclopedia of The Wars of the Roses'', ed. John A. Wagner, (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of feudalism, prominent in the [[War of the Roses]], was different from regular feudalism because it introduces money into the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034150/feudalism "Feudalism"], by [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1i.html#Feudalism "Feudalism?"], by Paul Halsall. [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nobles could now pay their knights for their service in money instead of giving them land. This strengthened the feudal system because if there was a weak ruler, the strong government of the new nobles would support the people. The British nobles also created the [[Magna carta]] to reduce the kings power. This monetization of the class system changed how England was ruled and made it very different from the Eastern Civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034347/http://www.wku.edu/~rob.harbison/projects/Gfeudal.html "The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay"], by Robert Harbison, 1996, [[Western Kentucky University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To Western writers, in the 1940s, it became bound up with an idea of aggressive, "frustrated nationalism", which was seen as "intrinsically anti- or non-Western"; sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] wrote, "The already existing intellectual assessment of European nationalism adapted to the growth of the Third World variety by developing the couplet of mature Western versus immature Eastern nationalism.... This East-West dichotomy became an accepted part of Western political theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Füredi | first = Frank | title = Colonial wars and the politics of Third World nationalism | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year = 1994 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 1978 book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', by [[Edward Said]], was highly influential in further establishing concepts of the East–West dichotomy in the Western world, bringing into college lectures a notion of the East as "characterized by religious sensibilities, familial social orders, and ageless traditions" in contrast to Western "rationality, material and technical dynamism, and individualism."&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnett | first= Suzanne Wilson |author2=Van Jay Symons | title = Asia in the undergraduate curriculum: a case for Asian studies in liberal arts education | series = East Gate | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7656-0546-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the divide has also been posited as an Islamic "East" and an American and European "West."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrovic, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book | last = Chahuán | first = Eugenio | chapter = An East-West dichotomy: Islamophobia | title = Islamophobia and anti-Semitism | series = A Palestine-Israel Journal Book | editor1-last = Schenker | editor1-first=Hillel | editor2-last = Ziad | editor2-first = Abu Zayyad | publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-55876-403-8 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics note that an Islamic/non-Islamic East–West dichotomy is complicated by the global dissemination of [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and by cultural diversity within Islamic nations, moving the argument "beyond that of an East-West dichotomy and into a tripartite situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The East–West dichotomy has been used in studying a range of topics, including management, economics and linguistics. ''Knowledge Creation and Management'' (2007) examines it as the difference in [[organizational learning]] between [[Western culture]]s and the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Knowledge creation and management: new challenges for managers | last = Ichijō | first = Kazuo |author2=Ikujirō Nonaka | publisher = Oxford University Press US | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-19-515962-4 | page = 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely used in exploring the period of rapid economic growth that has been termed the "East-Asian miracle" in segments of [[East Asia]], particularly the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norberg | first = Johan | title = In defense of global capitalism | publisher = Cato Institute | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-930865-46-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists, in line with the West as a model of [[modernity]] posited by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], have perceived the economic expansion as a sign of the "[[Westernization]]" of the region, but others look for explanation in cultural/racial characteristics of the East, embracing concepts of fixed Eastern cultural identity in a phenomenon described as "New Orientalism".&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite book| last = Berger | first = Mark T. | chapter = The triumph of the East? The East-Asian Miracle and post-Cold War capitalism | title = The rise of East Asia: critical visions of the Pacific century | editor1-last = Borer | editor1-first = Douglas A. | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-16168-1 | pages = 260–261, 266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches to the East-West dichotomy have been criticized for failing to take into account the historical [[hybridity]] of the regions.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been brought to bear on examinations of [[intercultural communication]]. Asians are widely described as embracing an "inductive speech pattern" in which a primary point is approached indirectly, but Western societies are said to use "deductive speech" in which speakers immediately establish their point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cheng | first = Winnie | title= Intercultural conversation | volume = 118 | series = Pragmatics &amp; Beyond | publisher = [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 90-272-5360-9 | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is attributed to a higher priority among Asians in harmonious interrelations, but Westerners are said to prioritize direct communication.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 2001's ''Intercultural Communication: A Discourse Approach'' described the East–West dichotomy linguistically as a "false dichotomy", noting that both Asian and Western speakers use both forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scollon | first = Ronald | title= Intercultural communication: a discourse approach | volume = 21 | series= Language in Society | edition = 2 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-631-22418-1 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In addition to difficulties in defining regions and overlooking hybridity, the East–West dichotomy has been criticized for creating an artificial construct of regional unification that allows one voice to claim authority to speak for multitudes. In "The Triumph of the East?", Mark T. Berger speaks to the issue as relates to examination of the "East-Asian miracle": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historical power of the East-West dichotomy, and the fixed conceptions of culture/race to which it is linked, have increasingly allowed the national elites of the region to speak not only for their 'nations,' but even for Asia and Asians.... There are numerous instances of Western scholars, intent on challenging North American and/or Western hegemony in both material and discursive terms, ending up uncritically privileging the elite narratives of power-holders in Asia as authentic representatives of a particular non-Western nation or social formation (and also contributing to the continued use of the East-West dichotomy).&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[relativistic physics]], the '''electromagnetic stress–energy tensor''' is the contribution to the [[stress–energy tensor]] due to the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stress–energy tensor]] describes the flow of energy and momentum in [[spacetime]]. The '''electromagnetic stress–energy tensor''' contains the negative of the classical [[Maxwell stress tensor]] that governs the electromagnetic interactions.

== Definition ==

=== SI units ===

In free space and flat space–time, the electromagnetic stress–energy [[tensor]] in [[SI units]] is&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[ F^{\mu \alpha}F^\nu{}_{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} \eta^{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha\beta}\right] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic tensor]] and where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)#Flat spacetime|Minkowski metric tensor]] of [[metric signature]] (−+++). When using the metric with signature (+−−−), the expression for &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; will have opposite sign.  

Explicitly in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} =\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2+\frac{1}{\mu_0}B^2\right) &amp; S_\text{x}/c &amp; S_\text{y}/c &amp; S_\text{z}/c \\
S_\text{x}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{xx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{xy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{xz} \\
S_\text{y}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{yx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{yy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{yz} \\
S_\text{z}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{zx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{zy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{zz} \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B},&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Poynting vector]], 

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = \epsilon_0 E_i E_j + \frac{1}{{\mu _0}}B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu _0}B^2 \right)\delta _{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Maxwell stress tensor]], and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed and measured in SI pressure units ([[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]).

=== CGS units ===

The [[permittivity of free space]] and [[permeability of free space]] in [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]] are

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0=\frac{1}{4\pi},\quad \mu_0=4\pi\,&lt;/math&gt;

then:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{4\pi} [ F^{\mu\alpha}F^{\nu}{}_{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} \eta^{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

and in explicit matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} =\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{8\pi}(E^2+B^2) &amp; S_\text{x}/c &amp; S_\text{y}/c &amp; S_\text{z}/c \\ S_\text{x}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{xx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{xy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{xz} \\
S_\text{y}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{yx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{yy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{yz} \\
S_\text{z}/c &amp; -\sigma_\text{zx} &amp; -\sigma_\text{zy} &amp; -\sigma_\text{zz} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Poynting vector]] becomes: 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=\frac{c}{4\pi}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}. &lt;/math&gt;

The stress–energy tensor for an electromagnetic field in a [[dielectric]] medium is less well understood and is the subject of the unresolved [[Abraham–Minkowski controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;however see Pfeifer et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 79, 1197 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The element &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}\!&lt;/math&gt; of the stress–energy tensor represents the flux of the ''μ''th-component of the [[four-momentum]] of the electromagnetic field, &lt;math&gt;P^{\mu}\!&lt;/math&gt;, going through a [[hyperplane]] (&lt;math&gt; x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is constant). It represents the contribution of electromagnetism to the source of the gravitational field (curvature of space–time) in [[general relativity]].

==Algebraic properties==
The electromagnetic stress–energy tensor has several algebraic properties:
* It is a [[symmetric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=T^{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt; 

* The tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{\nu}{}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Trace (linear algebra)|traceless]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha}{}_{\alpha}= 0&lt;/math&gt;.

* The energy density is [[Positive-definite function|positive-definite]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{00}\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetry of the tensor is as for a general stress–energy tensor in [[general relativity]]. The trace of the energy-momentum tensor is a [[Lorentz scalar]]; the electromagnetic field (and in particular electromagnetica waves) has no [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz-invariant]] energy scale, so its energy-momentum tensor must have a vanishing trace. This tracelessness eventually relates to the masslessness of the [[photon]].&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Anupam. ''Classical Electromagnetism in a Nutshell'', p. 564 (Princeton University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation laws ==

{{main|Conservation laws}}

The electromagnetic stress–energy tensor allows a compact way of writing the [[conservation laws]] of linear [[momentum]] and [[energy]] in electromagnetism. The divergence of the stress–energy tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\nu T^{\mu \nu} + \eta^{\mu \rho} \, f_\rho = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the (4D) [[Lorentz force]] per unit volume on [[matter]].

This equation is equivalent to the following 4D conservation laws

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_\mathrm{em}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{S} + \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{p}_\mathrm{em}}{\partial t} - \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \sigma + \rho \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}  + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial t}\, = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} &lt;/math&gt; being the Lorentz force density),

respectively describing the flux of electromagnetic energy density

:&lt;math&gt;u_\mathrm{em} = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0}B^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and electromagnetic momentum density 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{em} = {\mathbf{S} \over {c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' is the [[electric current density]] and ''ρ'' the [[electric charge density]].

'''Exaggeration''' is a representation of something in an excessive manner. The exaggerator has been a familiar figure in Western culture since at least [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the [[alazon]]: 'the [[boaster]] is regarded as one who pretends to have distinguished qualities which he possesses either not at all or to a lesser degree than he pretends...exaggerating'.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (Penguin 1976) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opposite of [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]].

Words or expressions associated with exaggeration include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* catastrophization
* [[hyperbole]]
* laying it on thick
* magnification
* maximization
* overblowing
* overplaying
* overreacting
* overstating
* stretching the truth}}

==Everyday and psycho-pathological contexts==
Contexts of exaggeration include:

===Manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
The [[boast]]ing and bragging by [[hubris|arrogant]] or manipulative people has been sent up on stage since the first appearance of the alazon – 'a stock character in Greek [[comedy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1966)p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Inflated [[praise]] in the form of [[flattery]] and [[puffery]] has a similarly lengthy history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title="puff piece." Answers.com |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=1992 |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/puff-piece |accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplifying achievements, obstacles and problems to [[attention seeking|seek attention]] is an everyday occurrence, as 'in ''exaggerating'' what one feels by magnifying the emotional expression: this is the ploy used by the six-year-old who dramatically twists her face into a pathetic frown, lips quivering, as she runs to complain to her mother about being teased'.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exaggerating is also a type of [[Deception#Types|deception]],&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, L., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007). Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships (2nd ed.). Los Angeles: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a means of malingering – magnifying small injuries or discomforts as an excuse to [[malingering|avoid responsibilities]].&lt;ref name=Rogers3&gt;R. Rogers ''Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception'' 3rd Edition, Guilford, 2008. {{ISBN|1-59385-699-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character assassination===
{{Main|Character assassination}}
Character assassination typically involves deliberate exaggeration or manipulation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = D | title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive distortions===
{{Main|Cognitive distortion}}
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] views ''magnification'' (as opposed to ''[[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]'') as unconscious, unrealistic mental processing or cognitive distortion, which can take the form of probability overestimation or of catastrophizing. This is better known as 'making a big deal out of nothing.' 'Whereas probability overestimation refers to exaggerating the "likelihood" of an event, catastrophizing refers to exaggerating the "importance" of the event'.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Antony/P. J. Norton, ''The Anti-Anxiety Workbook'' (2008) p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related 'is ''overgeneralizing'', where one takes a single negative event and see it as a never-ending pattern of defeat'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (London 1999) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of cognitive exaggeration is inflation of the difficulty of achieving a goal after attaining it, possibly to improve [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Beth Azar [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun07/sciencewatch.aspx All puffed up] Monitor on Psychology June 2007, Vol 38, No. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[major depressive disorder|depression]], exaggerated all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called ''emotional amplifiers'' because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Here are some typical all-or-nothing thoughts:
* my efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure
* I am/other people are either all good or all bad
* if you're not with us, you're against us&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 63 and p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction formation====
[[Reaction formation]] ({{lang-de|Reaktionsbildung}}) is believed to be a [[defense mechanism]] in which emotions and impulses which are [[anxiety]]-producing or perceived to be unacceptable are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decatastrophizing====
{{Main|Decatastrophizing}}
In [[cognitive therapy]], decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a [[cognitive restructuring]] technique to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing, commonly seen in psychological disorders like [[anxiety]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ryan C. Martin, Eric R.

===Pathology===

[[Psychoanalysis]] considered that neurotic exaggerations were the products of [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1994) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; – overvaluations for example being used to maintain a repression elsewhere. Thus a conflict over [[ambivalence]] may be resolved by means of exaggerating one's love for a person so as to keep an unconscious hatred in further check.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[grandiosity|grandiose]] sense of self-importance observed in [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt; also uses exaggeration to thwart any recognition  of a moderate fallibility, seeing any departure from complete success as total and hopeless failure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-dramatization, theatricality, and ''exaggerated'' expression of emotion" can be observed in those with [[histrionic personality disorder]]&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Personality disorder#Cluster B .28dramatic.2C emotional or erratic disorders.29|Cluster B personality disorders]]; while "catastrophizing" is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depressive]], [[neurosis|neurotic]] or [[paranoid]]  behavior – focusing on the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or thinking that a situation is unbearable or impossible when it is really just uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John M.Grohol; PsyD |title=What is Catastrophizing? – Psych Central |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/what-is-catastrophizing/ |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofthefog.net/CommonBehaviors/Catastrophizing.html|title=Catastrophizing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Münchausen syndrome by proxy===
{{Main|Münchausen syndrome by proxy}}
Münchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term for a behavior pattern in which a [[caregiver]] deliberately exaggerates, fabricates, or induces physical, psychological, behavioral, or mental health problems in those who are in their care.&lt;ref name="MBPBasics"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lasher |first=Louisa |url=http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |title=MBP Definitions, Maltreatment Behaviors, and Comments |accessdate=30 January 2012 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034655/http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |archive-date=12 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alarmism==
{{Main|Alarmism}}
Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm about a real or imagined [[threat]] e.g. the increases in deaths from [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xu472710j0670176/ |title=Alarmism is an infectious disease |journal=Society |doi=10.1007/BF02912206 |volume=34 |author=David Murray, Joel Schwartz |issue=4 |pages=35 |date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alarmist person is subject to the [[cognitive distortion]] of catastrophizing – of always expecting the worst of possible futures.&lt;ref&gt;P.

'Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device'.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Draitser, ''Techniques of Satire'' (1994) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that 'the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits'.&lt;ref&gt;M. Eastman/W. Fry, ''Enjoyment of Laughter'' (2008) p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caricature====
{{Main|Caricature}}
A caricature can refer to a [[portrait]] that exaggerates or distorts the essence of a person or thing to create an easily identifiable visual likeness: 'disproportionately increasing and emphasizing the defects of the features'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Filippo Baldinucci]], quoted in Harold Osborne ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (Oxford 1992) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/literaryterms/g/caricature.htm|title=Literary Term Definition of Resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slapstick====
{{Main|Slapstick}}
Slapstick is the recourse to humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/slapstick |title=slapstick - definition of slapstick by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Slapstick-Comedy.html |title=Slapstick Comedy - film, cinema |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Slapstick+comedy |title=Slapstick comedy definition of Slapstick comedy in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exaggerated depictions are often found in cartoons, and light film comedies aimed at younger audiences.

====Paradoxical laughter====
{{Main|Paradoxical laughter}}
Paradoxical laughter is an exaggerated expression of humor which is unwarranted by external events. It may be uncontrollable laughter which may be recognised as inappropriate by the person involved. Freud considered 'the compulsive laughter which so often occurs on mournful occasions'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; the by-product of ambivalence.

====Miles Gloriosus====
[[Image:1600spanishcapitano.jpg|thumb|[[Il Capitano]] uses bravado and excessive shows of manliness to hide his true cowardly nature.]]
{{Main|Miles Gloriosus}}
The boastful soldier or Miles Gloriosus has for thousands of years formed part of the Western stage. 'The original ''miles gloriosus'' in [[Plautus]] is a son of Jove and Venus who has killed an elephant with his fist and seven thousand men in one day's fighting. In other words, he is trying to put on a good show: the exuberance of his boasting helps to put the play over'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overacting===
{{Main|Overacting}}
Overacting is the exaggeration of [[gesture]]s and speech when [[acting]]. It may be unintentional, particularly in the case of a bad [[actor]], or be required for the role. For the latter, it is commonly used in comical situations or to stress the [[evil]] characteristics of a [[villain]]. Since the perception of acting quality differs between people the extent of overacting can be subjective.

===Animation===
Exaggeration is an effect especially useful for [[animation]], as perfect imitation of reality can look static and dull in cartoons.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationtoolworks.com/library/article9.html|title=12 Principles|last=Lightfoot|first=Nataha|publisher=Animation Toolworks|accessdate=June 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609091550/http://www.animationtoolworks.com/library/article9.html|archive-date=9 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of exaggeration depends on whether one seeks realism or a particular style, like a caricature or the style of a specific artist. The classical definition of exaggeration, employed by [[Disney]], was to remain true to reality, just presenting it in a wilder, more extreme form.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston &amp; Thomas (1981), p. 65-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of exaggeration can involve the supernatural or surreal, alterations in the physical features of a character; or elements in the storyline itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|title=Exaggeration|last=Willian|date=June 29, 2006|publisher=Blender|accessdate=June 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202658/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to employ a certain level of restraint when using exaggeration.  If a scene contains several elements, there should be a balance in how those elements are exaggerated in relation to each other, to avoid confusing or overawing the viewer.&lt;ref name="PoA E"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/exaggera.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413033041/http://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/exaggera.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2001|title=Exaggeration|last=De Stefano|first=Ralph A|publisher=Electronic Visualization Laboratory, [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=June 28, 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock jock===
{{Main|Shock jock}}
A shock jock is a type of [[radio]] broadcaster or [[disc jockey]] who entertains listeners or attracts attention using [[humor]] and/or [[melodrama]]tic exaggeration that some portion of the listening audience may find offensive.

===Tragedy===
[[File:Hamlet William Morris Hunt.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of ''[[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'', by [[William Morris Hunt]]]]
Although the boaster (alazon) is primarily a comic figure, 'the ''alazon'' may be one aspect of the [[tragic]] hero as well: the touch of ''miles gloriosus'' in [[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]], even in [[Othello (character)|Othello]], is unmistakable, as is the touch of the obsessed philosopher in [[Faust]]us and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressionism===
{{Main|Expressionism}}
'"Expressionist art"...attempted to intensify the expression of feeling and attitude by exaggeration'.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Thomas Hardy'' (2010) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In its wake, even the 'new and hard [[New Objectivity|realism]]...kept much of the distortion and exaggeration which had been one of the chief devices of earlier Expressionism'.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Osborne ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (Oxford 1992) p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary analogues===
* In the [[BookWorld]], warnings are issued about {{'}}'''Poetry Island'''...any visit longer than a few hours will have an ''exaggerating'' effect on the senses. Upbeat poems will tend to have you laughing uncontrollably, while sombre poems will have you questioning your own worth in a most hideously self-obsessed manner'.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Fforde, ''One of Our Thursdays is Missing'' (London 2011) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Monty Python]] [[Dirty Fork]] sketch demonstrates an absurd level of catastrophization where restaurant staff commit suicide and murder each other because of a customer complaint of a dirty fork. Compare with the scene in the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' involving the [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight character]] which is the opposite extreme of absurdity ([[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]).

The '''green economy''' is defined as an [[economy]] that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for [[sustainable development]] without [[environmental degradation|degrading the environment]]. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]], but has a more politically applied focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/AboutGEI/WhatisGEI/tabid/29784/Default.aspx|title=-- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - Error page --|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] Green Economy Report argues "that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive."&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of [[natural capital]] and [[ecological services]] as having economic value (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] and [[Bank of Natural Capital]]'') and a [[full cost accounting]] regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bedfellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Sticker and [[ecolabel]] practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a [[globalizing]] economy.

== "Green" economists and economics ==
"Green economics" is loosely defined as any theory of [[economics]] by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after [[Lynn Margulis]]).  A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist.  Proponents of [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], the [[environmental movement]], [[peace movement]], [[Green politics]], [[green anarchism]] and [[anti-globalization]] movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to [[mainstream economics]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of [[Green parties]] which are formally organized and claim the capital-G "Green" term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of "'green economists"' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, [[biomimicry]] and a fuller accounting for [[biodiversity]].  (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and [[Bank of Natural Capital]] for a layperson's presentation of these.''){{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools.  For instance, it is regarded as [[classical economics]] where the traditional land is generalized to [[natural capital]] and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as [[canal]]s). Or, it is viewed as [[Marxist economics]] with nature represented as a form of [[Lumpenproletariat]], an exploited base of non-human workers providing [[surplus value]] to the human economy, or as a branch of [[neoclassical economics]] in which the [[price of life]] for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of [[natural capital]] and [[full cost accounting]] under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of "green economics".  As of 2010 the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions (notably the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11642538|title=World Bank to lead economic push on nature protection|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Monetary Fund]] (via its "Green Fund" initiative) responsible for global [[monetary policy]] have stated a clear intention to move towards [[biodiversity]] valuation and a more official and universal [[biodiversity finance]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the [[Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that "based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation." &lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt;

The [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap|title=Green Economy Roadmap|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505222844/http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap/|archivedate=5 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf UNDESA, (2012). A guidebook to the Green Economy.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127180157/http://uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf |date=2013-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap, containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of “green economy”. It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:

* Open and competitive markets
* Metrics, accounting, and reporting
* Finance and investment
* Awareness
* Life cycle approach
* Resource efficiency and decoupling
* Employment
* Education and skills
* Governance and partnership
* Integrated policy and decision-making

==Ecological measurements==
Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of [[Index (economics)|economic index]] indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. 
# 2010 - 2016 Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI),&lt;ref name="ggei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-2016.pdf |title=2016 Global Green Economy Index |publisher=Dual Citizen LLC |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by consultancy Dual Citizen LLC is in its 5th edition. It measures the green economic performance and perceptions of it in 80 countries and 50 cities along four main dimensions of leadership &amp; climate change, efficiency sectors, markets &amp; investment and the environment.
# 2009 - 2012 Green City Index &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/greencityindex.htm|title=Home - English - Siemens Global Website|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global study commissioned by [[Siemens]]
# 2009 - 2013 [[Circles of Sustainability]] project scored 5 cities in 5 separate countries.

[[Ecological footprint]] measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/reports/Ecological_Footprints_of_Canadian_Municipalities_and_Regions_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green energy issues ==
Green economies require [[green energy]] generation based on [[renewable energy]] to replace  [[fossil fuels]] as well as [[energy conservation]] and [[efficient energy use]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

There is justification for [[market failure]] to respond to [[environmental protection]] and [[climate protection]] needs with the excuse that high [[external costs]] and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of [[green energy]] sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;(Reinhardt, 1999; King and Lenox, 2002; Wagner, 203; Wagner, et al., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The [[German Renewable Energy Act]], legislations of many other [[member states of the European Union]] and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], all provide such market incentives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, other experts&lt;ref&gt;[[Amory Lovins]], [[Hunter Lovins]], and [[Paul Hawken]], authors of ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'', and [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] and Shel Horowitz, authors of ''Guerrilla Marketing Goes Green''&lt;/ref&gt; argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.

A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|price mechanisms to protect nature]], arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy "will spur even greater convergence of [[corporate power]] and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108015332/http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 January 2012|title=New Report: Who Will Control the Green Economy? - ETC Group|author=|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, ''Towards a Green Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/greeneconomyreport/tabid/29846/default.aspx |title=Green Economy - Green Economy Report |publisher=UNEP |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while well-intentioned "ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/report/green-economy-wolf-sheeps-clothing|title=The Green Economy: the Wolf in Sheep’s clothing|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for [[UNCTAD]] also says that the focus on Green Economy and "green growth" in particular, "based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate
change" and "may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can
bring about a U-turn of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/osgdp2011d5_en.pdf U.Hoffmann (2011), "Some reflections on climate change, green growth illusions and development space"]&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/fgml.pdf Spash, C.L. 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''Grossman model of health demand''' is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care outlined by [[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]] in a monograph in 1972 entitled: ''The demand for health: A theoretical and empirical investigation''. The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the "founding father of demand for health models".&lt;ref name="JRC2012"&gt;Jones, Andrew M. Rice, Nigel, and Contoyannis, Paul. ''The Dynamics of Health'' in Jones, Andrew M., ed. The Elgar companion to health economics. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012. p15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

==Theoretical expansions==
The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Charles E. "Demand for reimbursement insurance." In The role of health insurance in the health services sector, pp. 115-162. NBER, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, Maureen L. "Health, investment in health, and occupational choice." Journal of Political Economy 85, no. 6 (1977): 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Isaac. On the interaction between education and health and the concept of human capital. Mimeo., Jan, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, Jan Paul. "Nonmonetary factors in the demand for medical services: some empirical evidence." Journal of Political Economy 83, no. 3 (1975): 595-614.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"&gt;Grossman 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical estimation==
Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by [[Joseph Newhouse]] in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This study sought to estimate income, money price, and time price elasticities of demand for medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Willard G., Joseph P. Newhouse, Naihua Duan, Emmett B. Keeler, and Arleen Leibowitz. "Health insurance and the demand for medical care: evidence from a randomized experiment." The American economic review (1987): 251-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"/&gt; Another important study was the Oregon Health Insurance in the late 2000s and also estimated the role of public health provision on healthcare demand and was led by [[Katherine Baicker]] and [[Amy Finkelstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Amy, Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P. Newhouse, Heidi Allen, Katherine Baicker, and Oregon Health Study Group. "The Oregon health insurance experiment: evidence from the first year." The Quarterly journal of economics 127, no. 3 (2012): 1057-1106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dicotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Muurinen, Jaana-Marja. "Demand for health: a generalised Grossman model." Journal of Health economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 5-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6850">'''The Group on International Perspectives on Governmental Aggression and Peace''' [http://people.bu.edu/gipgap/ (GIPGAP)] is an international multi-disciplinary team of academics and researchers. The group has been undertaking extensive research into social attitudes to [[peace]] and [[war]], using the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, or PAIRTAPS. There is no shortage of critical literature on peace and war. However this is the first-ever global study of the attitudes of ordinary citizens to peace and war. GIPGAP is co-ordinated by [[Kathleen Malley-Morrison]] of [[Boston University]], and has its origins in an earlier group that investigated [[domestic violence]] within a project entitled International Perspectives on Family Violence and Abuse. The GIPGAP project involves surveying and analysis of the views of citizens from more than 30 countries —covering [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Western Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], the [[Asia Pacific]], [[South Asia]], [[Australia]], and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Research Instrument==
The basic research instrument, the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, is an online survey, utilizing aspects of both [[qualitative research]] and [[quantitative research]]. Respondents are encouraged to indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with certain propositions and the instrument also encourages respondents to make specific comment upon issues. The survey is available to respondents in a range of language versions, including English, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese.

==Research Findings==
Preliminary findings for individual countries can be found in the publications list and especially the 4-volume publication in 2009 by Praeger International. In general, there was disapproval for the notion that nations should have a right to invade other nations, disapproval for the use of torture, disapproval for the killing of [[civilians]], approval for the right to protest war, and tentative approval for the notion of a right to peace.  Women were very much in support of the notion of the right of children to grow up in a world of peace. Further research, analysis and scholarly publication is planned for the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5505">'''Higher self''' is a term associated with multiple belief systems, but its basic premise describes an eternal, omnipotent, conscious, and intelligent [[being]], who is one's [[real self]]. [[Blavatsky]] formally defined the higher self as "[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]] the inseparable ray of the Universe and one self. It is the God above, more than within, us". Each and every individual has a Higher self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-9.htm The Key to Theosophy], H.P. Blavatsky, 1889, p175. {{ISBN|0-8356-0427-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The Higher Self is generally regarded as a form of being only to be recognized in a union with a divine source. In recent years the New Age faith has encouraged the idea of the Higher Self in contemporary culture, though the notion of the Higher Self has been interpreted throughout numerous historical spiritual faiths. Some denominations believe that the higher self is a part of an individual's metaphysical identity, while others teach that the higher self is essentially our tie to the heavens. Similar to the notion of the soul, the higher self can be defined by many different sects, while also being a topic of interest in the scientific and philosophical fields.

== Religious views ==

'''Christianity:''' In the Christian interpretation, all beings contain a fragment of the [[Holy Spirit]], which ties them to their Higher Self. The concept of the Holy Spirit is widely taught by various Christian sects, but the idea of the individual higher consciousness is discussed less frequently. Christian theology adheres that the Higher Self is what connects one to God, and thus one must honor and keep one's Higher Self pure by following the ethical guidelines outlined in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Holcombe, Alfred D., and Suzanne M. Holcombe. "Biblically-Derived Concept of Mankind's Higher-Self-Lower Self Nature." Journal of Religion &amp; Psychical Research 28.1 (2005): 20-25. EBSCOhost. Web. 10 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41); a central tenet of Christianity is that the body is still under the bondage of sin and is therefore imperfect, unlike the Higher Self, which remains untainted.

'''Buddhism:''' In Buddhism, the [[Nirvana Sutra]] describes the notion of Higher self.

'''Islam:''' In Sufism and some esoteric Shia sects (Batiniyya), the [[Higher Self]] has an important role, which is connected with notion of al-Insān al-Kāmil, the six organs, Al-Nafsul Mud’ma’inah and Fana'.


'''Hinduism:''' In Hinduism, the higher self is one and the same with the  [[Jiva]] or individual self. With this perspective, the Hindu faith generally teaches that the higher self, or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is not an object possessed by an individual, rather the self is the subject which perceives. In his book, ''The Higher Self'', Deepak Chopra utilizes the views of the Hindi denomination to support his claims concerning the divine force that is acquired with the awareness of the self. Hinduism teaches that through the  examination of self-knowledge, or “atma jnana,” one can attain salvation by comprehending the true self.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, D. (2001). The Higher Self. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age:''' Most New Age literature defines the Higher self as an extension of the self to a godlike state. This Higher Self is essentially an extension of the worldly self. With this perspective, New Age text teaches that in exercising your relationship with the higher self, you will gain the ability to manifest your desired future before you. In other words, the self creates its own reality when in union with the Higher Self.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff, Woutner J. "New Age Spiritualities as Secular Religion: A Historian's Perspective." Social Compass 46.2 (1999): 145-60. Scp.sagepub. Web. 10 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher self meditation and channeling ==

In numerous reports concerning the Higher Self, the practice of meditation or channeling to contact the Higher Self is highly encouraged. Most of this ideology agrees with the concept that with mindful awareness of the higher self, peace, salvation, or enlightenment may be procured. This is due to the idea that the Higher Self contains an advanced amount of insight into man’s most taxing questions, such as the purpose of existence or death, etc.  
Evidence of this insight is found within the book, ''Open to Channel: How To Connect With Your Guide'', where dual authors [http://www.orindaben.com/pages/home/aboutsr/ Sanaya Roman] and [http://www.orindaben.com/pages/home/aboutdp/ Duane Packer] report a collective and educational account of the practice and benefits of existing in alignment with the Higher Self. This piece cites views from numerous practitioners of meditation and channeling who claim a consistent result of newly acquired peace and intuition. Essentially, the idea behind this practice is that through spiritual exposure, a person can make a conscious connection with their higher self or other higher beings. In this state, the meditator is free to tap into this higher intelligence in order to develop a more enlightened perspective on world matters.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Sanaya, and Duane Packer. Opening To Channel: How To Connect With Your Guide. Tiburon: HJ Kramer, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">[[File:Image-based flow visualization.png|thumb|Image-based flow visualization where a grid image is advected by the flow field.]]

In [[scientific visualization]], '''image-based flow visualization''' (or '''visualisation''') is a computer modelling technique developed by [[Jarke van Wijk]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Wijk|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack van Wijk|title=Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings ACM SIGGRAPH 2002, San Antonio, Texas|year=2002|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/ibfv/ibfv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to visualize two dimensional flows of liquids such as water and air, like the wind movement of a [[tornado]]. Compared with integration techniques it has the advantage of producing a whole image at every step, as the technique relies upon graphical computing methods for frame-by-frame capture of the model of advective transport of  a decaying dye. It is a method from the [[texture advection]] family.

==Principle==
The core idea is to create a noise texture on a regular grid and then bend this grid according to the flow (the vector field). The bent grid is then sampled at the original grid locations. Thus, the output is a version of the noise, that is displaced according to the flow.

[[File:Image-Based Flow Visualization.svg|Warping of the grid and resampling at original locations]]

The advantage of this approach is that it can be accelerated on modern graphics hardware, thus allowing for real-time or almost real-time simulation of 2D flow data. This is particularly handy if one wants to visualise multiple scaled versions of the vector field to first gain an overview and then concentrate on the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiscale Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings of SPIE's Conference on Visualization and Data Analysis (VDA) 2006|volume=6060|pages=606001|year=2006|url=http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~strzodka/papers/public/TeSt06MIBFV.pdf |bibcode=2006SPIE.6060E..01T|last1=Telea|first1=Alexandru|last2=Strzodka|first2=Robert|doi=10.1117/12.640425|series=Visualization and Data Analysis 2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.72.3457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Integrated Chain Management''' (ICM), also known as '''Integral Chain Management''', is an approach for the reduction of environmental impact of product chains. Such a product chain exists out of an extraction phase, a production phase, a use phase and a waste phase. The ultimate goal of ICM is a reduction of environmental load over the whole chain. Integrated Chain Management is one of the approaches that can be used to come to [[sustainable development]]. Other approaches in this line are the [[Ecological Footprint]] and the [[DTO approach]]. 

Within the ICM approach all phases within the chain must be considered.  Therefore it can be seen as a "cradle to grave" approach. 
Several inputs and outputs can be taken into account when applying the ICM approach. Such as: Energy flows, mass flows, materials, waste flows and emissions.  Within ICM material cycles should be closed where possible and the remainder flows of [[air pollution|emissions]] and waste should be brought within acceptable boundaries. Also the use of resources should be kept to a minimum.  

Integrated chain management should not be mixed up with [[Supply Chain Management]] or [[Integrated Supply Chain Management]]. These concepts do not have the reduction of environmental load as their main goal. 

An important aspect of ICM is that shifting to other phases in the product chain is avoided. For instance, a producer of chairs can choose to leave off an environment unfriendly material in a new product. The producer can even see this as an extra selling point for the customer, but as a consequence the supplier of raw materials has to use much more energy to produce a material with the same qualities. The result of this is that there may no longer be a net environmental reduction across the whole chain. Within the integrated chain management approach this is avoided. 

The chain can be managed by developing new policies and economical or political incentives. Therefore one must have insight into the inputs and outputs of the production chain. Before these policies can be developed one must engage in several actions.  

*Analyse the processes into a preferred level of detail
*Determine the boundaries of the chain. Should links outside the companies be involved as well? 
*Determine whether there should be a focus on just one or on several environmental problems
*Determine on which material flows or energy flows there should be a focus. 

Effective supply chain management can impact virtually all business and production processes

==Example==
An example of applying the ICM approach would be to develop policies in a particular product area. The responsibility of problems caused by the waste stage can be assigned to the producers of these products. This leads to improved product design and new insight in how to put these products in the market. For instance the product can be sold with a disposal contribution. On the price tag of a radio nowadays can be printed:  "this radio costs 25 $ not including the 3 $ disposal contribution" 
The effects can be seen within the whole chain. The producer will try to choose non-polluting materials, as they increase the costs of the waste-stage. The producer of raw materials will try to improve its production process in order to meet the increased demand for 'clean' primary products. And the consumer will be aware that some products give more pressure on the environment than others when its economical lifespan has run out.

A separate concept was introduced by the linguist and public intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]] in an essay published as a special supplement by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' on 23 February 1967, entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]". Chomsky argues that [[intellectuals]] should make themselves responsible for searching for the [[truth]] and the exposing of lies.

'''Irreducible complexity''' ('''IC''') is the idea that certain [[biological system]]s cannot [[evolution|evolve]] by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through [[natural selection]]. Irreducible complexity is central to the [[creationism|creationist]] concept of [[intelligent design]], but it is rejected by the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"&gt;"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."

The theological [[teleological argument|argument from design]] was presented in [[creation science]] with assertions that evolution could not explain complex molecular mechanisms, and in 1993 [[Michael Behe]], a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, presented these arguments in a revised version of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; In his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' he called this ''irreducible complexity'' and said it made evolution through natural selection of random mutations impossible.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael |title= Darwin's Black Box |publisher= Free Press |location= New York |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-0-684-82754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the mistaken assumption that evolution relies on improvement of existing functions, ignoring how complex adaptations originate from changes in function, and disregarding published research.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; [[evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] have published rebuttals showing how systems discussed by Behe can evolve,&lt;ref name="thornton2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redundant Complexity"/&gt; and examples documented through [[comparative genomics]] show that complex molecular systems are formed by the addition of components as revealed by different temporal origins of their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602072257/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |archivedate=2014-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-341|title=Evolution of xyloglucan-related genes in green plants|first1=Luiz Eduardo V.|last1=Del Bem|first2=Michel GA|last2=Vincentz|date=5 November 2010|publisher=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=10|pages=341|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=BioMed Central|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Michael Behe]] defined irreducible complexity in natural selection in his book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Black Box'' page 39 in the 2006 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second definition given by Behe (his "evolutionary definition") is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex evolutionary pathway is one that contains one or more unselected steps (that is, one or more necessary-but-unselected mutations). The degree of irreducible complexity is the number of unselected steps in the pathway.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison'', July 31, 2000, [http://www.discovery.org/a/442 Discovery Institute article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906193225/http://www.discovery.org/a/442 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Intelligent design advocate [[William A. Dembski]] gives this definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system.&lt;ref&gt;''No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence.'' by William Dembski pp. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The argument from irreducible complexity is a descendant of the [[teleological argument]] for God (the argument from design or from complexity). This states that because certain things in nature appear very complicated, they must have been designed. [[William Paley]] famously argued, in his 1802 [[watchmaker analogy]], that complexity in nature implies a God for the same reason that the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker.&lt;ref name="paley"/&gt; This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ii.34,&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature of the Gods'', translated by Francis Brooks, London: Methuen, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Henry Hallam]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpDzTASTVwsC&amp;pg=PA385 ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1854] volume 2 page 385 part iii chapter iii section i paragraph 26 footnote ''u''&lt;/ref&gt; written in 45 BC.

====Up to the 18th century====

[[Galen]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) wrote about the large number of parts of the body and their relationships, which observation was cited as evidence for creation.&lt;ref&gt;''De Formatione Foetus''=''The Construction of the Embryo'', chapter 11 in ''Galen: Selected Works'', translated by P. N. Singer, ''The World's Classics'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-19-282450-9}}. One 18th-century reference to Galen is [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm#A13 [[David Hume]] ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', 1779, Part 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122134556/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm |date=2005-11-22 }}, &amp;sect; 3, page 215. Also see Galen's ''De Usu Partium''=''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'', translated and edited by Margaret Tallmadge May, Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1968, especially book XVII.

Adelmann, ''Marcello Malpighi and the Evolution of Embryology'' Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1966, volume 2, pages 811-812.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John Wilkins]] (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree."&lt;ref&gt;John Wilkins,''Of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion'', London, 1675, book I, chapter 6, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th-century, [[Thomas Burnet]] referred to "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" to argue against the [[eternity]] of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm ''The Sacred Theory of the Earth''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020060523/http://sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm |date=2007-10-20 }}, 2nd edition, London: Walter Kettilby, 1691.

====19th century====
Chapter XV of Paley's ''Natural Theology'' discusses at length what he called "relations" of parts of living things as an indication of their design.&lt;ref name="paley"&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 William Paley:''Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity.

[[Georges Cuvier]] applied his principle of the ''correlation of parts'' to describe an animal from fragmentary remains. For Cuvier, this  related to another principle of his, the ''conditions of existence'', which excluded the possibility of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially chapters VI and VII of {{cite book|author= William Coleman |title= Georges Cuvier, Zoologist: A Study in the History of Evolution Theory |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1964}} See also the discussion of these principles in the Wikipedia article on [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While he did not originate the term, [[Charles Darwin]] identified the argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction of the theory of evolution at the outset. In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), he wrote, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=207 page 189, Chapter VI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930011159/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=207 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite book|author= Alan R.

In the late 19th century, in a dispute between supporters of the adequacy of [[natural selection]] and those who held for [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], one of the arguments made repeatedly by [[Herbert Spencer]], and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as ''co-adaptation'' of ''co-operative'' parts, as in: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We come now to Professor [[August Weismann|Weismann]]'s endeavour to disprove my second thesis — that it is impossible to explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in "The Principles of Biology." In §166, I instanced the enormous horns of the extinct [[Irish elk]], and contended that in this and in kindred cases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other parts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to suppose that they can have all spontaneously varied in the required proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Page 594 in: {{cite journal|author= Herbert Spencer|title= Weismannism Once More|journal= [[The Contemporary Review]]|date= October 1894|volume= 66 |pages= 592–608}} Another essay of Spencer's treating this concept is: {{cite journal|author= Herbert Spencer |title= The Inadequacy of "Natural Selection" |journal= The Contemporary Review |volume= 63 |year= 1893 |pages= 153–166}} (Part I: February) and pages 439-456 (Part II: March).

However, far from seeing this as a problem for evolution, he described the "interlocking" of biological features as a consequence to be expected of evolution, which would lead to irreversibility of some evolutionary changes.&lt;ref name="Muller_1918"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors |journal= Genetics |volume= 3 |issue= 5 |pages= 422–99 |year= 1918 |url= http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |pmid= 17245914 |pmc= 1200446 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518220445/http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |archivedate= 2007-05-18 |df=  }}, especially pages 463–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics |journal= Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= 14 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–80, quotation from 272 |year= 1939 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1939.tb00934.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] introduced a similar concept in his book ''Scientific Creationism'', in which he wrote; "This issue can actually be attacked quantitatively, using simple principles of mathematical probability. The problem is simply whether a complex system, in which many components function unitedly together, and in which each component is uniquely necessary to the efficient functioning of the whole, could ever arise by random processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Henry M. Morris|Morris, Henry]] |title= Scientific creationism |publisher= Creation-Life Publishers |location= San Diego, Calif |year= 1974 |page= 59 |isbn= 0-89051-003-2 |edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 [[Thomas H. Frazzetta]] published a book-length study of a concept similar to irreducible complexity, explained by gradual, step-wise, non-teleological evolution. Frazzetta wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A complex adaptation is one constructed of ''several'' components that must blend together operationally to make the adaptation "work". It is analogous to a machine whose performance depends upon careful cooperation among its parts. In the case of the machine, no single part can greatly be altered without changing the performance of the entire machine."&lt;/blockquote&gt; The machine that he chose as an analog is the [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]], and one biological system given extended description was the jaw apparatus of a python. The conclusion of this investigation, rather than that evolution of a complex adaptation was impossible, "awed by the adaptations of living things, to be stunned by their complexity and suitability", was "to accept the inescapable but not humiliating fact that much of mankind can be seen in a tree or a lizard."&lt;ref&gt;T.

In 1981, Ariel Roth, in defense of the [[creation science|creation-science]] position in the trial ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'', said of "complex integrated structures": "This system would not be functional until all the parts were there ... How did these parts survive during evolution ...?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Keough, Mark J. |author2= Geisler, Norman L. |title= The Creator in the courtroom "Scopes II": the 1981 Arkansas creation-evolution trial |publisher= Mott Media |location= Milford, Mich |year= 1982 |page= 146 |isbn= 0-88062-020-X |url= http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070623192424/http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |archivedate= 2007-06-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Cairns-Smith]] wrote of "interlocking": "How can a complex collaboration between components evolve in small steps?" and used the analogy of the scaffolding called [[centring|centering]] - used to [[arch#Construction|build an arch]] then removed afterwards: "Surely there was 'scaffolding'.

An essay in support of [[creationism]] published in 1994 referred to bacterial [[flagella]] as showing "multiple, integrated components", where "nothing about them works unless every one of their complexly fashioned and integrated components are in place".

An early concept of irreducibly complex systems comes from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901-1972), an Austrian biologist.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1952). ''Problems of Life: An Evaluation of Modern Biological and Scientific Thought, pg 148'' {{ISBN|1-131-79242-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that complex systems must be examined as complete, [[irreducibility|irreducible]] systems in order to fully understand how they work. He extended his work on biological complexity into a general theory of systems in a book titled ''[[systems theory|General Systems Theory]]''.

After [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published the structure of [[DNA]] in the early 1950s, General Systems Theory lost many of its adherents in the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Monod, Jacques 
|title= Chance and necessity: an essay on the natural philosophy of modern biology |publisher= Vintage Books |location= New York |year= 1972 |isbn= 0-394-71825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Systems theory remained popular in the social sciences long after its demise in the physical and biological sciences.

===Origins===
[[File:Darwinsblackbox.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Michael Behe]]'s controversial book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' popularized the concept of irreducible complexity.]]

[[Michael Behe]] developed his ideas on the concept around 1992, in the early days of the '[[wedge strategy|wedge movement]]', and first presented his ideas about "irreducible complexity" in June 1993 when the "Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars" met at Pajaro Dunes in California.&lt;ref name=bfwedge&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm#I The Wedge at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=2014-09-05 }}. Talk Reason.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |author=Forrest B |editor=Pennock RT |chapter=1: The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism is Wedging its way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream |title=Intelligent design creationism and its critics: philosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2001 |pages=5–54 |isbn=0-262-66124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set out his ideas in the second edition of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' published in 1993, extensively revising Chapter 6 ''Biochemical Similarities'' with new sections on the complex mechanism of blood clotting and on the origin of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/new-pandas-has-creationist-scholarship-improved The New Pandas: Has Creationist Scholarship Improved?] Comments on 1993 Revisions by Frank J. Sonleitner (1994)&lt;br/&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/critique-pandas-people Introduction: Of Pandas and People, the foundational work of the 'Intelligent Design' movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229222228/http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/critique-pandas-people |date=2008-12-29 }} by Nick Matzke 2004,&lt;br/&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/rncse/26/1-2/design-trial Design on Trial in Dover, Pennsylvania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229192206/http://ncseweb.org/rncse/26/1-2/design-trial |date=2008-12-29 }} by Nicholas J Matzke, NCSE Public Information Project Specialist&lt;/ref&gt;

He first used the term "irreducible complexity" in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', to refer to certain complex biochemical [[cell (biology)|cellular]] systems. He posits that evolutionary mechanisms cannot explain the development of such "irreducibly complex" systems. Notably, Behe credits philosopher [[William Paley]] for the original concept (alone among the predecessors) and suggests that his application of the concept to biological systems is entirely original.

Intelligent design advocates argue that irreducibly complex systems must have been deliberately engineered by some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]].

In 2001, [[Michael Behe]] wrote: "[T]here is an asymmetry between my current definition of irreducible complexity and the task facing natural selection. I hope to repair this defect in future work." Behe specifically explained that the "current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system", but the "difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Behe MJ |title=Reply to My Critics: A Response to Reviews of Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=685–709 |date=November 2001 |url=http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |doi=10.1023/A:1012268700496 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040554/http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe testified under oath that he "did not judge [the asymmetry] serious enough to [have revised the book] yet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am2.html Behe's testimony in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629222457/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am2.html |date=2006-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behe additionally testified that the presence of irreducible complexity in organisms would not rule out the involvement of evolutionary mechanisms in the development of organic life. He further testified that he knew of no earlier "peer reviewed articles in scientific journals discussing the intelligent design of the blood clotting cascade," but that there were "probably a large number of peer reviewed articles in science journals that demonstrate that the blood clotting system is indeed a purposeful arrangement of parts of great complexity and sophistication."&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael 2005 [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 88 of 139|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science (p. 88)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The judge ruled that "intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature".)&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 6: Conclusion, section H]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of evolution, genetic variations occur without specific design or intent. The environment "selects" the variants that have the highest fitness, which are then passed on to the next generation of organisms. Change occurs by the gradual operation of natural forces over time, perhaps slowly, perhaps more quickly (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]). This process is able to [[adaptation|adapt]] complex structures from simpler beginnings, or convert complex structures from one function to another (see [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]). Most intelligent design advocates accept that evolution occurs through mutation and natural selection at the "[[microevolution|micro level]]", such as changing the relative frequency of various beak lengths in finches, but assert that it cannot account for irreducible complexity, because none of the parts of an irreducible system would be functional or advantageous until the entire system is in place.

===The mousetrap example===
[[File:Mausefalle 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Behe]] believes that many aspects of life show evidence of design, using the [[mousetrap]] in an analogy disputed by others.&lt;ref name=trap&gt;[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html A reducibly complex mousetrap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041104/http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html |date=2014-02-22 }} (graphics-intensive, requires [[JavaScript]])&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.

In his 2008 book ''[[Only A Theory]]'', biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] challenges Behe's claim that the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=Only /&gt; Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls that one of his classmates&lt;blockquote&gt;...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly.... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap.... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the hold-down bar and catch-- off the trap to make it easier to conceal and more effective as a catapult... [leaving] the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher.... I realized why [Behe's] mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.&lt;ref name=Only&gt;{{cite book |title= Only A Theory |first= Kenneth R. |last= Miller |location= New York |year= 2008 |publisher= Viking Penguin |pages= 54–55 |isbn= 978-0-670-01883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other systems identified by Miller that include mousetrap components include the following:&lt;ref name= Only/&gt;
*use the spitball launcher as a tie clip (same three-part system with different function)
*remove the spring from the spitball launcher/tie clip to create a two-part key chain (base + hammer)
*glue the spitball launcher/tie clip to a sheet of wood to create a clipboard (launcher + glue + wood)
*remove the hold-down bar for use as a toothpick (single element system)

The point of the reduction is that - in biology - most or all of the components were already at hand, by the time it became necessary to build a mousetrap. As such, it required far fewer steps to develop a mousetrap than to design all the components from scratch.

Thus, the development of the mousetrap, said to consist of five different parts which had no function on their own, has been reduced to one step: the assembly from parts that are already present, performing other functions.

The Intelligent Design argument focuses on the functionality to catch mice. It skips over the case that many, if not all, parts are already available in their own right, at the time that the need for a mousetrap arises.

===Consequences===

Supporters of intelligent design argue that anything less than the complete form of such a system or organ would not work at all, or would in fact be a ''detriment'' to the organism, and would therefore never survive the process of natural selection. Although they accept that some complex systems and organs ''can'' be explained by evolution, they claim that organs and biological features which are ''irreducibly complex'' cannot be explained by current models, and that an intelligent designer must have created life or guided its evolution. Accordingly, the debate on irreducible complexity concerns two questions: whether irreducible complexity can be found in nature, and what significance it would have if it did exist in nature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Behe's original examples of irreducibly complex mechanisms included the bacterial [[flagellum]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[coagulation|the blood clotting cascade]], [[cilia]], and the [[adaptive immune system]].

Behe argues that organs and biological features which are irreducibly complex cannot be wholly explained by current models of [[evolution]]. In explicating his definition of "irreducible complexity" he notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irreducible complexity is not an argument that evolution does not occur, but rather an argument that it is "incomplete". In the last chapter of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', Behe goes on to explain his view that irreducible complexity is evidence for [[intelligent design]]. Mainstream critics, however, argue that irreducible complexity, as defined by Behe, can be generated by known evolutionary mechanisms. Behe's claim that no scientific literature adequately modeled the origins of biochemical systems through evolutionary mechanisms has been challenged by [[TalkOrigins Archive|TalkOrigins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html Claim CA350: Professional literature is silent on the subject of the evolution of biochemical systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304172657/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html |date=2007-03-04 }} TalkOrigins Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael J. |authorlink= Michael Behe |title= Darwin's black box: the biochemical challenge to evolution |isbn= 0-684-82754-9 |page= 72 |chapter= |quote= "Yet here again the evolutionary literature is totally missing.

Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..."&lt;ref name=kitz74&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 74 of 139|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], December 2005. Page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stated examples==
Behe and others have suggested a number of biological features that they believe may be irreducibly complex.

===Blood clotting cascade===
The process of blood clotting or [[coagulation]] cascade in vertebrates is a complex biological pathway which is given as an example of apparent irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Action, George [http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html "Behe and the Blood Clotting Cascade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050605075004/http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html |date=2005-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary, and therefore could not have been added sequentially. However, in evolution, something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boudry |first=Maarten |authorlink=Maarten Boudry |last2=Blancke |first2=Stefaan |last3=Braeckman |first3=Johan |authorlink3=Johan Braeckman |title=Irreducible Incoherence and Intelligent Design: A Look into the Conceptual Toolbox of a Pseudoscience |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=473–82 |publisher= |date=September 2010 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |issn= |doi=10.1086/656904 |accessdate= |pmid=21243965 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095300/http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= |hdl=1854/LU-952482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural selection]] can lead to complex biochemical systems being built up from simpler systems, or to existing functional systems being recombined as a new system with a different function.&lt;ref name=kitz74/&gt; For example, one of the clotting factors that Behe listed as a part of the clotting cascade ([[Factor XII]], also called Hageman factor) was later found to be absent in whales, demonstrating that it is not essential for a clotting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semba U, Shibuya Y, Okabe H, Yamamoto T |title=Whale Hageman factor (factor XII): prevented production due to pseudogene conversion |journal=Thromb Res |year=1998 |pages=31–7 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pmid=9678675 |doi= 10.1016/S0049-3848(97)00307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many purportedly irreducible structures can be found in other organisms as much simpler systems that utilize fewer parts. These systems, in turn, may have had even simpler precursors that are now extinct. Behe has responded to critics of his clotting cascade arguments by suggesting that [[homology (biology)|homology]] is evidence for evolution, but not for natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael [http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm "In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917181325/http://arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm |date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "improbability argument" also misrepresents natural selection. It is correct to say that a set of simultaneous mutations that form a complex protein structure is so unlikely as to be unfeasible, but that is not what Darwin advocated. His explanation is based on small accumulated changes that take place without a final goal. Each step must be advantageous in its own right, although biologists may not yet understand the reason behind all of them—for example, [[jawless fish]] accomplish blood clotting with just six proteins instead of the full ten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 Creationism special: A sceptic's guide to intelligent design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506100626/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 |date=2015-05-06 }}, New Scientist, 9 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[eye]] is an example of a supposedly irreducibly complex structure, due to its many elaborate and interlocking parts, seemingly all dependent upon one another. It is frequently cited by intelligent design and creationism advocates as an example of irreducible complexity. Behe used the "development of the eye problem" as evidence for intelligent design in ''Darwin's Black Box''. Although Behe acknowledged that the evolution of the larger anatomical features of the eye have been well-explained, he pointed out that the complexity of the minute biochemical reactions required at a molecular level for light sensitivity still defies explanation. Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] has described the eye as evolutionary biologists' "greatest challenge as an example of superb 'irreducible complexity' in God's creation", specifically pointing to the supposed "vast complexity" required for transparency.&lt;ref name="aig"&gt;[[Jonathan Sarfati|Sarfati, Jonathan]] (2000).

However, the quote in context shows that Darwin actually had a very good understanding of the evolution of the eye (see [[fallacy of quoting out of context]]). He notes that "to suppose that the eye ... could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree". Yet this observation was merely a [[procatalepsis|rhetorical device]] for Darwin. He goes on to explain that if gradual evolution of the eye could be shown to be possible, "the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection ... can hardly be considered real".

Since Darwin's day, the eye's ancestry has become much better understood. Although learning about the construction of ancient eyes through fossil evidence is problematic due to the soft tissues leaving no imprint or remains, genetic and comparative anatomical evidence has increasingly supported the idea of a common ancestry for all eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=New perspectives on eye evolution |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=602–9 |date=October 1995 |pmid=8664548 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |doi=10.1016/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507170439/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |archivedate=2018-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=Induction of ectopic eyes by targeted expression of the eyeless gene in Drosophila |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5205 |pages=1788–92 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7892602 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7892602 |doi=10.1126/science.7892602 |bibcode=1995Sci...267.1788H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomarev SI, Callaerts P, Kos L, etal |title=Squid Pax-6 and eye development |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2421–6 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9122210 |pmc=20103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9122210 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2421 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2421T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current evidence does suggest possible evolutionary lineages for the origins of the anatomical features of the eye. One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of [[photoreceptor cell]]s that could detect the presence or absence of light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be "selected for" as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken [[aperture]] of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how [[collimated]] the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a [[pinhole camera]] which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes—the [[nautilus]] is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images.&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, Russell D. (2001).

Behe maintains that the complexity of light sensitivity at the molecular level and the minute biochemical reactions required for those first "simple patches of photoreceptor[s]" still defies explanation, and that the proposed series of infinitesimal steps to get from patches of photoreceptors to a fully functional eye would actually be considered great, complex leaps in evolution if viewed on the molecular scale. Other intelligent design proponents claim that the evolution of the entire visual system would be difficult rather than the eye alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Meaningful World|year=2006|author1=Benjamin Wiker |author2=Jonathan Witt |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flagella===
{{Main article|Evolution of flagella}}

The [[flagella]] of certain bacteria constitute a [[molecular motor]] requiring the interaction of about 40 different protein parts. Behe presents this as a prime example of an irreducibly complex structure defined as "a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning", and argues that since "an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional", it could not have evolved gradually through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Flagellum Unspun"/&gt;

'''Reducible complexity'''. In contrast to Behe's claims, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, even though sometimes at reduced efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajagopala SV, Titz B, Goll J, Parrish JR, Wohlbold K, McKevitt MT, Palzkill T, Mori H, ((Finley RL Jr)), Uetz P |year= 2007 |title= The protein network of bacterial motility |url= |journal= Mol Syst Biol |volume= 3 |issue= |page= 128 |doi= 10.1038/msb4100166 |pmid= 17667950 |pmc=1943423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the composition of flagella is surprisingly diverse across bacteria with many proteins only found in some species but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Titz B, Rajagopala SV, Ester C, Häuser R, Uetz P |date= Nov 2006 |title= Novel conserved assembly factor of the bacterial flagellum |journal= J Bacteriol |volume= 188 |issue= 21 |pages= 7700–6 |doi= 10.1128/JB.00820-06 |pmid= 16936039 |pmc=1636259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components.

===Cilium motion===

The [[cilium]] construction of [[axoneme]] microtubules movement by the sliding of [[dynein]] protein was cited by Behe as an example of irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;page 90: "Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules, connectors, and motors.  Therefore we can conclude that the cilium is irreducibly complex - an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian evolution."{{cite book | title = Signs of Intelligence, article Darwin's Breakdown: Irreducible Complexity and Design at the Foundation of Life | author = [[Michael Behe|Behe, Michael]]| year = 1999

{{main|Bombardier beetle}}

The [[bombardier beetle]] is able to defend itself by directing a spray of hot fluid at an attacker.

A computer model of the co-evolution of proteins binding to DNA in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'' consisted of several parts (DNA binders and DNA binding sites) which contribute to the basic function; removal of either one leads immediately to the death of the organism. This model fits the definition of irreducible complexity exactly, yet it evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Thomas D. Schneider|Schneider TD]] |title=Evolution of Biological Information |journal= Nucleic Acids Research |year=2000 |pages=2794–2799 |volume=28 |issue=14 |pmid=10908337 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.14.2794 |pmc=102656}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The program can be run from [http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/ Ev program].)

In addition, research published in the peer-reviewed journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] has shown that computer simulations of evolution demonstrate that it is possible for complex features to evolve naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Richard Lenski|Lenski RE]], Ofria C, Pennock RT, Adami C |title= The evolutionary origin of complex features |journal= Nature |year= 2003 |pages= 139–44 |volume= 423 |issue= 6936 |pmid= 12736677 |doi= 10.1038/nature01568|bibcode= 2003Natur.423..139L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can compare a mousetrap with a cat in this context. Both normally function so as to control the mouse population. The cat has many parts that can be removed leaving it still functional; for example, its tail can be bobbed, or it can lose an ear in a fight. Comparing the cat and the mousetrap, then, one sees that the mousetrap (which is not alive) offers better evidence, in terms of irreducible complexity, for intelligent design than the cat. Even looking at the mousetrap analogy, several critics have described ways in which the parts of the mousetrap could have independent uses or could develop in stages, demonstrating that it is not irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;

Moreover, even cases where removing a certain component in an organic system will cause the system to fail do not demonstrate that the system could not have been formed in a step-by-step, evolutionary process. By analogy, stone arches are irreducibly complex&amp;mdash;if you remove any stone the arch will collapse—yet humans [[arch#Construction|build them]] easily enough, one stone at a time, by building over [[centring|centering]] that is removed afterward. Similarly, [[natural arch|naturally occurring arches]] of stone form by the weathering away of bits of stone from a large concretion that has formed previously.

Evolution can act to simplify as well as to complicate. This raises the possibility that seemingly irreducibly complex biological features may have been achieved with a period of increasing complexity, followed by a period of simplification.

A team led by [[Joseph Thornton (biologist)|Joseph Thornton]], assistant professor of biology at the [[University of Oregon]]'s Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, using techniques for resurrecting ancient genes, reconstructed the evolution of an apparently irreducibly complex molecular system. The April 7, 2006 issue of ''Science'' published this research.&lt;ref name="thornton2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridgham JT, Carroll SM, Thornton JW |title=Evolution of hormone-receptor complexity by molecular exploitation |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5770 |pages=97–101 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16601189 |doi=10.1126/science.1123348 |bibcode= 2006Sci...312...97B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033744/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 |date=2007-09-30 }} University of Oregon, April 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreducible complexity may not actually exist in nature, and the examples given by Behe and others may not in fact represent irreducible complexity, but can be explained in terms of simpler precursors. The theory of [[facilitated variation]] challenges irreducible complexity. [[Marc W. Kirschner]], a professor and chair of Department of Systems Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[John C. Gerhart]], a professor in Molecular and Cell Biology, [[University of California, Berkeley]], presented this theory in 2005. They describe how certain mutation and changes can cause apparent irreducible complexity. Thus, seemingly irreducibly complex structures are merely "very complex", or they are simply misunderstood or misrepresented.

===Gradual adaptation to new functions===
{{Main article|Exaptation}}
The precursors of complex systems, when they are not useful in themselves, may be useful to perform other, unrelated functions. Evolutionary biologists argue that evolution often works in this kind of blind, haphazard manner in which the function of an early form is not necessarily the same as the function of the later form. The term used for this process is [[exaptation]]. The [[evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|mammalian middle ear]] (derived from a jawbone) and the [[giant panda|panda]]'s thumb (derived from a wrist bone spur) provide classic examples. A 2006 article in ''Nature'' demonstrates intermediate states leading toward the development of the ear in a [[Devonian]] fish (about 360 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature |volume= 439 |pages= 318–21 |date= January 19, 2006 |author1=M.

Ahlberg |doi= 10.1038/nature04196 |issue= 7074 |title= Tetrapod-like middle ear architecture in a Devonian fish |pmid= 16421569|bibcode= 2006Natur.439..318B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, recent research shows that viruses play a heretofore unexpected role in evolution by mixing and matching genes from various hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boto|first=Luis|date=October 28, 2009|title=Horizontal gene transfer in evolution: facts and challenges|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1683/819|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=|pages=|via=The Royal Society Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments for irreducibility often assume that things started out the same way they ended up&amp;mdash;as we see them now. However, that may not necessarily be the case. In the ''Dover'' trial an expert witness for the plaintiffs, Ken Miller, demonstrated this possibility using Behe's mousetrap analogy. By removing several parts, Miller made the object unusable as a mousetrap, but he pointed out that it was now a perfectly functional, if unstylish, [[tie clip]].&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVAChapter8&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |title= NOVA: Transcripts: Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial Chapter 8 |date= November 13, 2007 |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate= 2008-12-17 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081123085214/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |archivedate= November 23, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods by which irreducible complexity may evolve===
{{further|Evolvability}}

Irreducible complexity can be seen as equivalent to an "uncrossable valley" in a [[fitness landscape]]. A number of mathematical models of evolution have explored the circumstances under which such valleys can, nevertheless, be crossed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Desai|first2=Michael M.|last3=Fisher|first3=Daniel S. |last4=Feldman |first4=Marcus W.|title=The rate at which asexual populations cross fitness valleys|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 2009 |volume=75 |issue=4|pages=286–300|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2009.02.006|pmid=19285994|pmc=2992471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=D.

===Falsifiability and experimental evidence===
Some critics, such as [[Jerry Coyne]] (professor of [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]) and [[Eugenie Scott]] (a [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] and former executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]]) have argued that the concept of irreducible complexity and, more generally, [[intelligent design]] is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] and, therefore, not [[scientific]].

Behe argues that the theory that irreducibly complex systems could not have evolved can be falsified by an experiment where such systems are evolved. For example, he posits taking bacteria with no [[flagella|flagellum]] and imposing a selective pressure for mobility. If, after a few thousand generations, the bacteria evolved the bacterial flagellum, then Behe believes that this would refute his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolutionnews.org/2016/10/philosophical_o/|title=Philosophical Objections to Intelligent Design: A Response to Critics|last=Behe|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2016|website=Evolution News &amp; Science Today|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=August 2018}}

Other critics take a different approach, pointing to experimental evidence that they believe falsifies the argument for Intelligent Design from irreducible complexity. For example, [[Kenneth R. Miller|Kenneth Miller]] cites the lab work of Barry G. Hall on [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], which he asserts is evidence that "Behe is wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Miller K |title= Finding Darwin's God: a scientist's search for common ground between God and evolution |publisher= Cliff Street Books |location= New York |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-06-093049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence that irreducible complexity is not a problem for evolution comes from the field of [[computer science]], which routinely uses computer analogues of the processes of evolution in order to automatically design complex solutions to problems. The results of such [[genetic algorithm]]s are frequently irreducibly complex since the process, like evolution, both removes non-essential components over time as well as adding new components. The removal of unused components with no essential function, like the natural process where rock underneath a [[natural arch]] is removed, can produce irreducibly complex structures without requiring the intervention of a designer. Researchers applying these algorithms automatically produce human-competitive designs—but no human designer is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|title=Human Competitive|author=|date=|website=www.genetic-programming.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708052427/http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|archivedate=8 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from ignorance===
Intelligent design proponents attribute to an intelligent designer those biological structures they believe are irreducibly complex and therefore they say a natural explanation is insufficient to account for them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Behe. [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 Evidence for Intelligent Design from Biochemistry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185728/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 |date=2006-09-03 }} 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics view irreducible complexity as a special case of the "complexity indicates design" claim, and thus see it as an [[argument from ignorance]] and as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument.&lt;ref name="isaak_ci101"&gt;Index to Creationist Claims. Mark Isaak. The Talk.Origins Archive. "Irreducible complexity and complex specified information are special cases of the "complexity indicates design" claim; they are also arguments from incredulity." {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI101.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031017/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc//CI/CI101.html |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }} "The argument from incredulity creates a god of the gaps." {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020072309/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugenie Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent-design proponents are arguments from ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenie C. Scott]] and Glenn Branch, [http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists "Intelligent Design" Not Accepted by Most Scientists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330203658/http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |date=2009-03-30 }}, National Center for Science Education website, September 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Behe has been accused by critics &lt;ref&gt;Patheos.com essay: An argument premised on the author's lack of imagination.{{cite web |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715212827/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amerikanbeat.net: A Critique of Behe, Dembski on "Irreducible Complexity"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100910063051/http://amerikanbeat.net/contact-amerikanbeat/a-critique-of-behe-dembski-on-%E2%80%9Cirreducible-complexity%E2%80%9D/]&lt;/ref&gt; of using an "argument by lack of imagination".

===False dilemma===
Irreducible complexity is at its core an argument against evolution. If truly irreducible systems are found, the argument goes, then [[intelligent design]] must be the correct explanation for their existence. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that current [[evolution]]ary theory and intelligent design are the only two valid models to explain life, a [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html IC and Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813171254/http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html |date=2004-08-13 }} makes the point that: if "irreducible complexity" is tautologically redefined to allow a valid argument that [[intelligent design]] is the correct explanation for life then there is no such thing as "irreducible complexity" in the mechanisms of life; while, if we use the unmodified original definition then "irreducible complexity" has nothing whatever to do with evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover]]'' noted that this implicit assumption of the defendant school board created a "flawed and illogical contrived dualism" (Opinion p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Dover trial==
While testifying during the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex [[molecular]] systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed nor are there any peer-reviewed articles supporting his argument that certain complex molecular structures are "irreducibly complex."&lt;ref name="Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science"/&gt;

In the final ruling of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Judge Jones specifically singled out Behe and irreducible complexity:&lt;ref name=Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science|Memorandum Opinion, Judge John E. Jones III, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Professor Behe admitted in "Reply to My Critics" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address "the task facing natural selection." and that "Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to "repair this defect in future work..." (Page 73)
*"As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by "irreducible complexity" renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. (3:40 (Miller)). In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exaptation as a well-recognized, well-documented explanation for how systems with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means." (Page 74)
*"By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of exaptation by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument. Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..." (Page 75)
*"As irreducible complexity is only a negative argument against evolution, it is refutable and accordingly testable, unlike ID [Intelligent Design], by showing that there are intermediate structures with selectable functions that could have evolved into the allegedly irreducibly complex systems. (2:15-16 (Miller)). Importantly, however, the fact that the negative argument of irreducible complexity is testable does not make testable the argument for ID. (2:15 (Miller); 5:39 (Pennock)). Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe's assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex." (Page 76)
*"...on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not "good enough." (23:19 (Behe))." (Page 78)
*"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. (17:45-46 (Padian); 3:99 (Miller)). Additionally, even if irreducible complexity had not been rejected, it still does not support ID as it is merely a test for evolution, not design. (2:15, 2:35-40 (Miller); 28:63-66 (Fuller)). We will now consider the purportedly "positive argument" for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the "purposeful arrangement of parts." Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the [[William Paley|Reverend William Paley]]'s argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller))." (Pages 79–80)

[[File:2007 Sakura of Fukushima-e 007 rotated.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cherry blossoms]]  are a symbol of ''isagiyosa'' in the sense of embracing the transience of the world]]
In [[Japanese society]], particularly in historical [[Edo society|feudal Japan]], '''''isagiyosa''''' ({{lang|ja|潔さ}}, "purity") is a [[virtue]], translated with "resolute composure" or "[[manliness]]".{{fact|date=August 2015}} 
Isagiyosa is the capability of accepting death with composure and equanimity.{{citation needed|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} It stands besides other central virtues such as public-spiritedness (''kō no seishin''), loyalty (''seijitsusa''), diligence (''kinbensa'') and steadiness (''jimichisa'').

[[Cherry blossom]]s, because of their ephemeral nature, are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Berenson, [[Neil deMause]], ''The complete illustrated guidebook to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden'' (2001), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Honda (2001) maintains that these virtues are not Japanese in particular but form a [[moral code]] common to all [[Asia]]n agricultural societies.&lt;ref&gt;Honda Yoshihiko, 2001, ‘Taiwan de “Taiwanron” wa dô yomareta ka,’ Sekai 688: pp. 220-228, cited after  Ulrike Wöhr, ''Japan’s “Return to Asia”: History, Diversity, Gender'', “[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/ICAS2/Woehr.pdf Images of Asia in Japanese Mass Media, Popular Culture and Literature]”, Papers Presented at ICAS 2, Berlin, Germany, 9–12 August 2001ü .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Joseph Patrick McShane''' (March 17, 1909 - December 23, 1968) was the former chief [[United States Marshal]] during part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

==Biography==
He was born in 1909 in [[New York City]]. 

As head of the Executive Office for U.S. Marshals, he supervised federal agents during the [[Freedom Rides]] of 1961, but is most known for his role in leading the federal agents who escorted [[James Meredith]], the first African American student at [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Personal Papers of James J.P. McShane (1909-1968)| work = | publisher = John F.

In November of 1962 McShane was indicted by a Lafayette County Mississippi grand jury on charges that he "did incite a riot" in relation to his decision to fire tear gas into crowds of violent protesters during the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. McShane subsequently gave himself up for arrest, was processed, and released. The US District Court found that McShane acted under orders and statutory authority and "had reasonable cause to believe ... that the use of tear gas ... was a proper measure to be taken". The court granted summary judgment in favor of McShane. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court | litigants=Petition of James P. McSHANE for a Writ of Habeas Corpus | court=United States District Court N. D. Mississippi, W. D | date=September 16, 1964 | url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1455034/in-re-mcshanes-petition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before being a U.S. Marshal, he worked for the Senate's select [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|McClellan Committee]], was chief of security and the personal bodyguard for President [[John F. Kennedy]] and a [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detective.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He died on December 23, 1968, from pneumonia in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = James McShane, Chief Marshal Who Escorted Meredith, Is Dead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">In [[mathematics]] the '''Karoubi envelope''' (or '''Cauchy completion''' or '''idempotent completion''') of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''C''' is a classification of the [[idempotent]]s of '''C''', by means of an auxiliary category. Taking the Karoubi envelope of a [[preadditive category]] gives a [[pseudo-abelian category]], hence the construction is sometimes called the pseudo-abelian completion. It is named for the French mathematician [[Max Karoubi]].

Given a category '''C''', an idempotent of '''C''' is an [[endomorphism]] 

:&lt;math&gt;e: A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;

with 

:&lt;math&gt;e\circ e = e&lt;/math&gt;.

An idempotent ''e'': ''A'' → ''A'' is said to '''split''' if there is an object ''B'' and morphisms ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'',
''g'' : ''B'' → ''A'' such that ''e'' = ''g'' ''f'' and 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' ''g''.

The '''Karoubi envelope''' of '''C''', sometimes written '''Split(C)''', is the category whose objects are pairs of the form (''A'', ''e'') where ''A'' is an object of '''C''' and &lt;math&gt;e : A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; is an idempotent of '''C''', and whose [[morphism]]s are the triples

: &lt;math&gt;(e, f, e^{\prime}): (A, e) \rightarrow (A^{\prime}, e^{\prime})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f: A  \rightarrow A^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism of '''C''' satisfying &lt;math&gt;e^{\prime} \circ f = f = f \circ e&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;f=e'\circ f\circ e&lt;/math&gt;).

Composition in '''Split(C)''' is as in '''C''', but the identity morphism 
on &lt;math&gt;(A,e)&lt;/math&gt; in '''Split(C)''' is &lt;math&gt;(e,e,e)&lt;/math&gt;, rather than
the identity on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The category '''C''' embeds fully and faithfully in '''Split(C)'''. In '''Split(C)''' every idempotent splits, and '''Split(C)''' is the universal category with this property.
The Karoubi envelope of a category '''C''' can therefore be considered as the "completion" of '''C''' which splits idempotents.

The Karoubi envelope of a category '''C''' can equivalently be defined as the [[full subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[presheaf (category theory)|presheaves]] over '''C''') of retracts of [[representable functor]]s. The category of presheaves on '''C''' is equivalent to the category of presheaves on '''Split(C)'''.

== Automorphisms in the Karoubi envelope ==

An [[automorphism]] in '''Split(C)''' is of the form &lt;math&gt;(e, f, e): (A, e) \rightarrow (A, e)&lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt;(e, g, e): (A, e) \rightarrow (A, e)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying:

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = e = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f \circ g = g&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f \circ g \circ f = f&lt;/math&gt;

If the first equation is relaxed to just have &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is a partial automorphism (with inverse ''g''). A (partial) involution in '''Split(C)''' is a self-inverse (partial) automorphism.

==Examples==

* If '''C''' has products, then given an [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; the mapping &lt;math&gt;f \times f^{-1}: A \times B \rightarrow B \times A&lt;/math&gt;, composed with the canonical map &lt;math&gt;\gamma:B \times A \rightarrow A \times B&lt;/math&gt; of symmetry, is a partial [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].
* If '''C''' is a [[triangulated category]], the Karoubi envelope '''Split'''('''C''') can be endowed with the structure of a triangulated category such that the canonical functor '''C''' → '''Split'''('''C''') becomes a [[triangulated functor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations| last1=Balmer | last2=Schlichting | year=2001 | nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Karoubi envelope is used in the construction of several categories of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]].
*The Karoubi envelope construction takes semi-adjunctions to [[adjoint functors|adjunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* The category of [[projective module]]s over any ring is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of free modules.
* The category of [[vector bundle]]s over any paracompact space is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of trivial bundles. This is in fact a special case of the previous example by the [[Serre-Swan theorem]] and conversely this theorem can be proved by first proving both these facts, the observation that the [[global section]]s functor is an equivalence between trivial vector bundles over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and projective modules over &lt;math&gt;C(X)&lt;/math&gt; and then using the universal property of the Karoubi envelope.

"'''Keep Your Eyes on the Prize'''" is a [[folk song]] that became influential during the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. It is based on the traditional song, "[[Gospel Plow]]," also known as "Hold On," "Keep Your Hand on the Plow," and various permutations thereof.

An early reference to the older song, "Gospel Plow," is in [[Alan Lomax]]'s 1949 book "''Our Singing Country''."&lt;ref name="Lomax"&gt;Lomax, John and Alan, ''Our Singing Country, A Second Volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs'', The Macmillan Company, New York, 1949. p 44 - 45&lt;br&gt;http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/our-singing-country/our-singing-country%20-%200007.htm&lt;br&gt;Roud Folk Song Index&lt;br&gt;http://www.vwml.org.uk/search/search-roud-indexes?qtext=10075&amp;ts=1377893044534&amp;collectionfilter=RoudFS;RoudBS#record=1&lt;/ref&gt; The book references a 1937 recording by Elihu Trusty of Paintsville, Kentucky, which is in the Library of Congress (Ref No .1397 A1). Lomax's references for Gospel Plow cite two earlier works. The first is from ''English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians'' &lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Cecil J., and Campbell, O., English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians. 2 vols. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1917. Vol. 2 p. 292 &lt;br&gt;Internet Archives - https://archive.org/details/englishfolksongs00camp&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1917, indicating that Gospel Plow dates from at least the early twentieth century. The second reference is to a 1928 book, ''American Negro Folk-Songs'',&lt;ref&gt;White, N. L, American Negro Folk-Songs. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1928. P115 &lt;br&gt;Google Books - https://books.google.com/books?id=WCuuV-kRe70C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; which shows an African-American heritage for the original song.

== Lyricist(s) ==

The lyrics to the modern Civil Rights version of the song, "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" are often attributed to Alice Wine from [[Johns Island, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;previous unsubstantiated internet references to "lyrics by Mrs. Alice Wine":&lt;br&gt;
http://www.acousticmusicarchive.com/eyes-on-the-prize-chords-lyrics&lt;br&gt;
http://folkmusic.about.com/od/folksongs/qt/KeepYourEyes.htm&lt;br&gt;
http://raymondfolk.wikifoundry.com/page/Gospel+Songs&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Wine was a member of the Moving Star Hall and the Progressive Club on Johns Island. The book ''Ain't You Got the Right to the Tree of Life'' by [[Guy Carawan|Guy and Candie Carawan]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy and Candie Carawan, ''Ain't You Got a Right to the Tree of Life?: The People of Johns Island South Carolina-Their Faces, Their Words, and Their Songs'', revised edition, University of Georgia Press (1994). 
&lt;br&gt;Original edition: Simon and Schuster, 1966
&lt;/ref&gt; documents songs of the Moving Star Hall and the lives of African Americans on Johns Island in the early sixties.

It is doubtful that Mrs. Wine actually composed the lyrics herself. More likely she had heard the revised refrain and variations on the verses of the older song from the congregation at the praise hall. The leading "Paul and Silas" stanzas in the modern "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" lyrics were already present in some versions of the older "Keep Your Hand on the Plow." ''Our Singing Country''&lt;ref name="Lomax" /&gt; shows these lyrics were already in use in 1949 and before. [[Odetta]] used them in her 1960 Carnegie Hall appearance and recording. Mrs Wine is credited by Candie Carawan only with having passed onto Guy Carawan the revision of the title from "Keep Your Hand on the Plow" to "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalstudio.ucr.edu/studio_projects/carawan/seaislands3.html University of California Digitial Studio Archives.]&lt;br&gt;
Also email from Candie Carawan to Johns Island Schoolhouse Museum, February 15, 2013, re. ''Tree of Life Exhibit'':&lt;br&gt;‘There is one thing we would like to correct on the panel of Alice Wine at the Progressive Club. It is not accurate to say that she is credited with writing the lyrics to "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize." She is credited with passing the phrase "eyes on the prize" to Guy who then incorporated it into the song. When Guy worked with Mrs. [[Septima Clark|Clark]] in the Citizenship program on Johns Island, he used songs in the classes. One of the songs was "Keep Your Hand on the Plow, Hold On" which he knew from the Labor Movement. Mrs. Wine took him aside and said "We know a different echo to that song --keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." Guy loved that and began to use it as he traveled around the South and met with groups at [[Highlander Folk School|Highlander]]. Later on Mrs. Wine found it hard to believe that she had made such an impact on the song.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrics for traditional American folk songs and African-American spirituals are often changed, improvised and traded between songs by different artists and at different performances. This was and is especially true in the call and response of African American religious music. For example, [[Mahalia Jackson]], in her 1958 performance of "Keep Your Hand on the Plow", begins with the couplet "''Mary had three links of chain, Every link bearin' Jesus name''." [[Bob Dylan]] also sings these lyrics in his upbeat version of "Gospel Plow." [[Carl Sandburg]], in his 1927 book ''The American Songbag'',&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg Carl, The American Songbag, Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York, 1927. x p 474&lt;/ref&gt; attributes these lyrics to yet another song entirely, "Mary Wore Three Links of Chain." Modern choral arrangements of this song sound entirely different from either the Eyes-Prize or Hand-Plow songs.&lt;ref&gt;The San Joaquin Chorale. December 4th, 2011 at the 1st Congregational Church of Fresno, CA. Director, Roy Klassen.&lt;br&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQEe4t6mUoY&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sandberg in the preface to his book and folk singer [[Pete Seeger]] in the opening remarks to his [[We Shall Overcome (Pete Seeger album)|Carnegie Hall performance of "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize"]] note the malleability of American and African-American folk music. No one artist can be historically credited with "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."

== Biblical references ==

The title of the modern song may be a reference to the [[Bible]] verse in [[Phillipians]] 3:17 "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A17-4%3A1&amp;version=NIV keep your eyes on those who live as we do]" and verse 14, "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A14&amp;version=NIV I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.]"

The "Gospel Plow" title is also shown as a reference to [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 9:62: "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A62&amp;version=NIV%20 No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.]"

The "Paul and Silas" lyrics are clearly a Biblical reference to [[Acts]] 16:19-26. Here are the lyrics minus refrain:

Paul and Silas, bound in jail&lt;br&gt;
Had no money for to go their bail&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Paul and Silas began to shout&lt;br&gt;
Doors popped open, and all walked out&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Well, the only chains we can stand&lt;br&gt;
Are the chains between hand and hand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
----
And the biblical passages:
&lt;br&gt;
'''Acts 16:19-26''' &lt;br&gt;
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A16-40&amp;version=NIV%20 New International Version]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
… they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. 20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar 21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. 23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. 24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5566">In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], the '''Kuratowski closure axioms''' are a set of [[axiom]]s that can be used to define a [[topological structure]] on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. They are equivalent to the more commonly used [[open set]] definition. They were first introduced by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1966|loc=p. 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar set of axioms can be used to define a topological structure using only the dual notion of [[Interior (topology)#Interior operator|interior operator]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; its [[power set]].&lt;br /&gt;
A '''Kuratowski Closure Operator''' is an assignment &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}:\mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kuratowski|1966}} has a fifth (optional) axiom stating that singleton sets are their own closures. He refers to topological spaces which satisfy all five axioms as T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces in contrast to the more general spaces which only satisfy the four listed axioms.&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Nullary Union)
# &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(A) \text{ for every subset }A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; (Extensivity)
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{cl}(A) \cup \operatorname{cl}(B) \text{ for any subsets }A,B \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Binary Union)
# &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{cl}(A)) = \operatorname{cl}(A) \text{ for every subset }A \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; ([[Idempotent function|Idempotence]])

If the last axiom, idempotence, is omitted, then the axioms define a [[preclosure operator]].

A consequence of the third axiom is: &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(B) &lt;/math&gt; (Preservation of Inclusion).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four Kuratowski closure axioms can be replaced by a single condition, namely,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup \operatorname{cl}(A) \cup \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{cl}(B)) = \operatorname{cl}(A \cup B) \setminus \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) \text{ for all subsets }A, B \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection to other axiomatizations of topology ==

=== Induction of Topology ===
'''Construction'''&lt;br /&gt;
A closure operator naturally induces a topology as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
A subset &lt;math&gt; C\subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; is called '''closed''' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(C) = C &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Empty Set and Entire Space are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
By extensitivity, &lt;math&gt; X\subseteq\operatorname{cl}(X) &lt;/math&gt; and since closure maps the power set of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into itself (that is, the image of any subset is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(X)\subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; X = \operatorname{cl}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is closed.&lt;br /&gt;
The preservation of nullary unions states that &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl}(\varnothing) = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

'''Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary set of indices and &lt;math&gt; C_i &lt;/math&gt; closed for every &lt;math&gt; i\in\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
By extensitivity, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, by preservation of inclusions, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i \subseteq C_i \forall i\in\mathcal{I} \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(C_i) = C_i \forall i\in\mathcal{I} \Rightarrow \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) \subseteq \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i = \operatorname{cl}(\bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \bigcap_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

'''Finite unions of closed sets are closed:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of indices and let &lt;math&gt; C_i &lt;/math&gt; be closed for every &lt;math&gt; i\in\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
From the preservation of binary unions and using [[mathematical induction|induction]] we have &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i = \operatorname{cl}(\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}C_i &lt;/math&gt; is closed.

=== Induction of closure ===
In any induced topology (relative to the subset ''A'') the closed sets induce a new closure operator that is just the original closure operator restricted to ''A'': &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cl_A}(B) = A \cap \operatorname{cl_X}(B) \text{ for all } B \subseteq A. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1964|loc=p. 49, Theorem 3.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovering notions from topology ===

'''Closeness'''&lt;br /&gt;
A point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is [[Closeness (topology)|close]] to a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;p\in\operatorname{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Continuity'''&lt;br /&gt;
A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] at a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;p\in\operatorname{cl}(A) \Rightarrow f(p)\in\operatorname{cl}(f(A))&lt;/math&gt;.

'''lebenslaute''' (motto: "classical music – political action") is an open [[direct action]] group that combines concerts of [[classical music]] with [[civil disobedience]], mostly by [[Open air concert|open-air]] protest concerts in unexpected locations. ''lebenslaute'' organizes several nonviolence performances per year on both national and regional levels in Germany.

In 2014, ''lebenslaute'' was awarded the renowned [[Peace Prize of Aachen]], Germany, together with the American organization [[Code Pink|Code Pink – Women for Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachener-friedenspreis.de/preistraeger/archiv/jahr-2014.html CodePink and Lebenslaute to be awarded the Peace Prize of Aachen] (de), ''aachener-friedenspreis.de'', 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded in the [[Aula Carolina]] in the city of [[Aachen]] each year on 1 September, the date on which [[International Day of Peace]] is celebrated in Germany, warningly commemorating the day on which [[Nazi Germany]] started [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939.

Since 1986, ''lebenslaute'' has been turning up in places where classical concerts are least expected, with group sizes between three and over one hundred and in professional black outfit. Locations are chosen in the eye of by-laws that would prohibit any activity of this kind in this spot, so political confrontation is consciously sought. Where possible, lebenslaute gives support to and cooperates with local civil disobedience groups. Direct action is deployed in places that are threatening to people or that design and manufacture objects used for killing, with the aim to protest against the official function of such organizations and locations in principle and in practise: any government agency where people are threatened, e.g. [[refugee]]s, any business of the [[arms industry]], any [[airport]] or [[prison]] used for [[deportation]], any [[nuclear power plant]], any [[military base]] and any other location that may have the aim of preparing for or conducting [[warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from http://www.lebenslaute.net, main page, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Every lebenslaute activity is prepared in groups and decisions are taken accordance in [[Grassroots democracy]]. [[Nonviolence]] as a principle is followed inside the groups, too: None of the activists is asked to do more than they want to. In case of legal proceedings following suit, individuals can be sure to be shown solidarity by other group members and by the group itself in cooperation with allied organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from [http://www.lebenslaute.net?page_id=17 About us], ''lebenslaute.net'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political action by ''lebenslaute'' took place in 1986 when a huge classical orchestra blocked the entrance to the US military base of [[Pershing II]] [[ballistic missile]]s near the town of [[Mutlangen]] in a rural area of [[Baden-Württemberg]], South-Western Germany.

[[File:Flag of France.svg|thumb|200px|[[Flag of France]] which represents ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'']]
'''''Liberté, égalité, fraternité''''' ({{IPA-fr|libɛʁte eɡalite fʁatɛʁnite|pron}}), [[French language|French]] for "[[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]]",&lt;ref name="FrEmb"&gt;{{cite web| title=Liberty, Égalité, Fraternité |publisher=Embassy of France in the US |accessdate=2014-09-18|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[national motto]] of [[France]] and the [[Republic of Haiti]], and is an example of a [[tripartite motto]]. Although it finds its origins in the [[French Revolution]], it was then only one motto among others and was not institutionalized until the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Ozouf&gt;{{Citation |first=Mona |last=Ozouf |author-link=Mona Ozouf |contribution=Liberté, égalité, fraternité stands for peace country and war |title=Lieux de Mémoire |trans-title=Places of memory |editor-first=Pierre |editor-last=Nora |editor-link=Pierre Nora |volume=tome III |publisher=Quarto Gallimard |year=1997 |pages=4353–89 |language=French}} (abridged translation, ''Realms of Memory'', Columbia University Press, 1996–98).&lt;/ref&gt; Debates concerning the compatibility and order of the three terms began at the same time as the Revolution. It is also the motto of the [[Grand Orient de France]] and the [[Grande Loge de France]].

==Origins during the French Revolution==
[[File:LibertyEqualityorDeath.jpg|thumb|Text displayed on a placard announcing the sale of ''[[biens nationaux]]'' (1793). Soon after the Revolution, the motto was sometimes written as "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death". The "death" part was later dropped for being too strongly associated with the [[Reign of Terror]].]]
The first to express this motto was [[Maximilien Robespierre]] in his speech ''"On the organization of the National Guard"'' ({{lang-fr|Discours sur l'organisation des gardes nationales}}) on 5 December 1790, article XVI, and disseminated widely throughout France by the popular Societies.

{{quote|'''Discours sur l'organisation des gardes nationales'''&lt;br /&gt;Article XVI.&lt;br /&gt;On their uniforms engraved these words: FRENCH PEOPLE, &amp; below: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY. The same words are inscribed on flags which bear the three colors of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;({{lang-fr|XVI. Elles porteront sur leur poitrine ces mots gravés : LE PEUPLE FRANÇAIS, &amp; au-dessous : LIBERTÉ, ÉGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ. Les mêmes mots seront inscrits sur leurs drapeaux, qui porteront les trois couleurs de la nation.}})|Maximilien Robespierre, 1790&lt;ref name="FrEmb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Maximilien |last=Robespierre |title=OEUVRES DE MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE |volume=Tome VI |year=1950 |publisher=PRESSES UNIVERSITAIRES DE FRANCE |page=643 |url=https://archive.org/details/oeuvrescomplte06robeuoft |accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From Robespierre's speech to the National Assembly on 5 December 1790. Cited in Triomphe et mort du droit naturel en Révolution, 1789-1795-1802, Florence Gauthier, éd. PUF/ pratiques théoriques, 1992, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Credit for the motto has been given also to [[Antoine-François Momoro]] (1756–94), a Parisian printer and [[Hébertists|Hébertist]] organizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Famous Sayings and Their Authors |last=Latham |first=Edward |year=1906 |publisher=Swan Sonnenschein |location=London |oclc=4697187 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvkNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Amable Guillaume P.

it was modified to "Unity, indivisibility of the Republic; liberty, equality, brotherhood or death" ({{lang-fr|Unité, Indivisibilité de la République; Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ou la mort}}) and suggested by a resolution of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] (member of which Momoro was elected by his [[section du Théâtre-Français]]) on 29 June 1793 to be inscribed on Parisian house-fronts and imitated by the inhabitants of other cities. In 1839, the philosopher [[Pierre Leroux]] claimed it had been an anonymous and popular creation.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} The historian Mona Ozouf underlines that, although ''Liberté'' and ''Égalité'' were associated as a motto during the 18th century, ''Fraternité'' wasn't always included in it, and other terms, such as ''Amitié'' (Friendship), ''Charité'' (Charity) or ''Union'' were often added in its place.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The emphasis on ''Fraternité'' during the French Revolution led [[Olympe de Gouges]], a female journalist, to write the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=World History |contribution=The Modern Era |last1=Ellis |last2=Esler |type=textbook}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} as a response. The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really institutionalized by the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; As soon as 1789, other terms were used, such as "''la Nation, la Loi, le Roi''" (The Nation, The Law, The King), or "''Union, Force, Vertu''" (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used beforehand by [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], or "''Force, Égalité, Justice''" (Strength, Equality, Justice), "''Liberté, Sûreté, Propriété''" (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

[[File:Enseigne Alsacienne revolutionnaire.jpg|thumb|upright|Alsatian sign, 1792:&lt;br /&gt;
''Freiheit Gleichheit Brüderlichk. od. Tod'' (Liberty Equality Fraternity or Death)&lt;br /&gt;
''Tod den Tyranen'' (Death to Tyrants)&lt;br /&gt;
''Heil den Völkern'' (Long live the Peoples)]]
In other words, ''liberté, égalité, fraternité'' was only one slogan among many others.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; During the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] revolutionary period itself, various mottos were used, such as ''liberté, unité, égalité'' (liberty, unity, equality); ''liberté, égalité, justice'' (liberty, equality, justice); ''liberté, raison, égalité'' (liberty, reason, equality), etc.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The only solid association was that of ''liberté'' and ''égalité'', ''fraternité'' being ignored by the ''[[Cahiers de doléances]]'' as well as by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. It was only alluded to in the 1791 [[French Constitution|Constitution]], as well as in [[Robespierre]]'s draft Declaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) ''égalité, liberté, sûreté'' and ''propriété'' (equality, liberty, safety, property — though it was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration), as the possibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: "Men of all countries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy of all."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Les hommes de tous les pays sont frères, celui qui opprime une seule nation se déclare l'ennemi de toutes.''"}} Finally, it did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 defined liberty in Article 4 as follows:

{{quote|Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.}}

Equality, on the other hand, was defined by the 1789 Declaration in terms of judicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):

{{quote|[The law] must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, shall be equally eligible to all high offices, public positions and employments, according to their ability, and without other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.}}

''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'' actually finds its origins in a May 1791 proposition by the ''[[Cordeliers|Club des Cordeliers]]'', following a speech on the Army by the [[marquis de Guichardin]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; A British marine held prisoner on the French ship ''Le Marat'' in 1794 wrote home in letters published in 1796:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Letters Written in France: To a Friend in London, Between the Month of November 1794, and the Month of May 1795 |first=Watkin |last=Tench |place=London |publisher=J Johnson |year=1796 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztMuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |page=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The republican spirit is inculcated not in songs only, for in every part of the ship I find emblems purposely displayed to awaken it. All the orders relating to the discipline of the crew are hung up, and prefaced by the words ''Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la Mort'', written in capital letters.}}

The compatibility of ''liberté'' and ''égalité'' was not doubted in the first days of the Revolution, and the problem of the antecedence of one term on the other not lifted.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, the [[Abbé Sieyès]] considered that only liberty ensured equality, unless the latter was to be the equality of all dominated by a [[Despotism|despot]]; while liberty followed equality ensured by the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The abstract generality of law (theorized by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in ''[[The Social Contract]]'') thus ensured the identification of liberty to equality, liberty being negatively defined as an independence from arbitrary rule, and equality considered abstractly in its judicial form.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

This identification of liberty and equality became problematic during the Jacobin period, when equality was redefined (for instance by [[François-Noël Babeuf]]) as [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]], and not only judicial equality of rights.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, [[Marc Antoine Baudot]] considered that French temperament inclined rather to equality than liberty, a theme which would be re-used by [[Pierre Louis Roederer]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], while [[Jacques Necker]] considered that an equal society could only be found on coercion.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The third term, ''fraternité'', was the most problematic to insert in the triad, as it belonged to another sphere, that of moral obligations rather than rights, links rather than statutes, harmony rather than [[Freedom of contract|contract]], and community rather than individuality.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Various interpretations of ''fraternité'' existed. The first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of "''fraternité de rébellion''" (Fraternity of Rebellion),&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; that is the union of the deputies in the ''[[Tennis Court Oath|Jeu de Paume Oath]]'' of June 1789, refusing the dissolution ordered by the King [[Louis XVI]]: "We swear never to separate ourselves from the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations." Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty and oriented by a common cause.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Another form of ''fraternité'' was that of the patriotic Church, which identified social link with religious link and based fraternity on Christian brotherhood.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; In this second sense, ''fraternité'' preceded both ''liberté'' and ''égalité'', instead of following them as in the first sense.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Thus, two senses of Fraternity: "one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object of a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its work of the divine craftsman."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Another hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from the opposition between liberty and equality as [[Individualism|individualistic]] values, and fraternity as the realization of a happy community, devoided of any conflicts and opposed to any form of [[egotism]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of [[Self-ownership|individual autonomy]] and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

In this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in ''Fraternité, ou la Mort!'' (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by establishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who were not (in the sense of "[[You're either with us, or against us|you are with me or against me]]", brother or foe).&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Louis de Saint-Just]] thus stigmatized [[Anarchasis Cloots]]' [[cosmopolitanism]], declaring "Cloots liked the universe, except France."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

With [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]] and the execution of Robespierre, ''fraternité'' disappeared from the slogan, reduced to the two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial equality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf/&gt; The [[First Consul]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]) then established the motto ''liberté, ordre public'' (liberty, public order).

==19th century==
Following Napoleon's rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed possible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]] and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The idea of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]] possessed by man before being united in the collectivity contradicted the possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Liberalism|Liberals]] accepted liberty and equality, defining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

[[Utopian socialism|Early socialists]] rejected an independent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised equality, as they considered, as [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to harmonize them, or they believed, as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], that equality contradicted [[Equity (economics)|equity]] by a brutal levelling of individualities.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Utopian socialism thus only valued fraternity, which was, in [[Etienne Cabet|Cabet]]'s [[Icarians|Icarie]] the sole commandment.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

This opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival historical interpretations of the Revolution, liberals admiring 1789, and socialists 1793.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The [[July Revolution]] of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], substituted ''ordre et liberté'' (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto ''Liberté, Ordre public''.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Despite this apparent disappearance of the triptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in Republican [[secret societies]], masonic lodges such as the "Indivisible Trinity," far-left booklets or during the [[Canuts Revolt]] in Lyon.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; In 1834, the lawyer of the [[Society of the Rights of Man]] (Société des droits de l'homme), [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure|Dupont]], a liberal sitting in the far-left during the [[July Monarchy]], associated the three terms together in the ''[[Revue Républicaine]]'' which he edited:

{{quote|Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he can not achieve it without the assistance of other men, without fraternity&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Tout homme aspire à la liberté, à l'égalité, mais on ne peut y atteindre sans le secours des autres hommes, sans la fraternité.''"}}}}

The triptych resurfaced during the 1847 ''[[Campagne des Banquets]]'', upheld for example in [[Lille]] by [[Ledru-Rollin]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Two interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic traditionalists, such as [[Chateaubriand]] or [[Ballanche]], the other by socialist and republicans such as [[Pierre Leroux]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his ''Mémoires d'outre-tombe'':

{{quote|Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality, fraternity&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Loin d'être à son terme, la religion du Libérateur entre à peine dans sa troisième période, la période politique, liberté, égalité, fraternité.''"}}}}

Neither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be antagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of Christianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the difficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering liberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Leroux thus ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; an order also supported by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], such as [[Buchez]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Against this new order of the triptych, [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial importance of an original individualistic right.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Michelet attempted to conciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, "right beyond right",&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} and thus the rival traditions of socialism and liberalism.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The [[republicanism|republican]] tradition would strongly inspire itself from Michelet's synchretism.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

===1848 Revolution===

}}
With the [[1848 February Revolution]], the motto was officially adopted,&lt;ref name="Frenchsymbols"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/discovering-france_2005/france-from-to-z_1978/the-symbols-of-the-republic-and-bastille-day_2002/ |title=The symbols of the Republic and Bastille Day |accessdate=2006-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly under the pressure of the people who had attempted to impose the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] over the [[Flag of France|tricolor flag]] (the 1791 red flag was, however, the symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection).&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Lamartine]] opposed popular aspirations, and in exchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican motto of ''Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité'', written on the flag, on which a red rosette was also to be added.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Fraternity was then considered to resume and to contain both Liberty and Equality, being a form of civil religion (which, far from opposing itself to Christianity, was associated with it in 1848&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}) establishing social link (as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the ''Social Contract'').&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

However, Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between brothers and foes, images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian publications, taking in [[Lamennais]]' themes.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, the newspaper ''[[Le Christ républicain]]'' (The Republican Christ) developed the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to the rich.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Christ républicain'' n°7, quoted by Mona Ozouf: "''Nous, pauvres prolétaires, nous sommes rouges, parce que le Christ a versé son sang pour nous racheter, son sang par lequel nous voulons nous régénérer. Nous sommes rouges, parce que l'ange exterminateur a marqué le haut de nos portes avec le sang de l'agneau, pour distinguer, au jour de la vengeance, les élus d'avec les réprouvés.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as 6 January 1852, the future [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], first President of the Republic, ordered all [[prefects of France|prefects]] to erase the triptych from all official documents and buildings, conflated with insurrection and disorder.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Auguste Comte]] applauded Napoleon, claiming equality to be the "symbol of metaphysical anarchism", and preferring to it his diptych "''ordre et progrès''" ("order and progress", which would then become the motto of Brazil, [[Ordem e Progresso]]).&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;{{Citation |trans-title=Flags &amp; meanings |url=http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 |title=Bandeiras e significados |newspaper=História net |accessdate=2010-10-09 |language=Portuguese}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Proudhon]] criticized fraternity as an empty word, which he associated with idealistic dreams of [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; He preferred to it the sole term of liberty.

===Paris Commune and Third Republic===
Pache, mayor of the [[Paris Commune]], painted the formula "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la mort" on the walls of the commune. It was only under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] that the motto was made official. It was then not dissociated with insurrection and revolutionary ardours, [[Opportunist Republicans]] such as [[Jules Ferry]] or [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]] adapting it to the new political conditions.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Pierre Larousse|Larousse]]'s ''Dictionnaire universel'' deprived fraternity of its "evangelistic halo" (Mona Ozouf), conflating it with solidarity and the [[welfare state|welfare role]] of the state.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Some still opposed the Republican motto, such as the nationalist [[Charles Maurras]] in his ''Dictionnaire politique et critique'', who claimed liberty to be an empty dream, equality an insanity, and only kept fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Charles Péguy]], renewing with Lamennais' thought, kept fraternity and liberty, excluding equality, seen as an abstract repartition between individuals reduced to homogeneity,&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; opposing "fraternity" as a sentiment put in motion by "misery", while equality only interested itself, according to him, to the mathematical solution of the problem of "poverty."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Péguy identified Christian charity and socialist solidarity in this conception of fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; On the other hand, [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]], the most important French author of [[scientific racism|pseudo-scientific racism]] and supporter of [[eugenism]], completely rejected the republican triptych, adopting another motto, "''déterminisme, inégalité, sélection''" (determinism, inequality, selection). But, according to Ozouf, the sole use of a triptych was the sign of the influence of the republican motto, despite it being corrupted in its opposite.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

==20th century==
During the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], this motto was replaced by the reactionary phrase "''[[travail, famille, patrie]]''" (work, family, fatherland)&lt;ref name="WHKLMA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vichy Government |work=World History |place=[[Germany|DE]] |publisher=KMLA | url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/france/vichy.html |accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]], who became the leader of the new [[Vichy France|Vichy]] French government in 1940. Pétain had taken this motto from the [[colonel de la Rocque]]'s ''[[Parti social français]]'' (PSF), although the latter considered it more appropriate for a movement than for a regime.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Following the Liberation, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) re-established the Republican motto ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'', which is incorporated into both the 1946 and the 1958 French constitutions.&lt;ref name="FrEmb" /&gt;

==Other nations==
Many other nations have adopted the French slogan of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" as an ideal. These words appear in the [[Preamble to the Constitution of India|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of India]], enforced in 1950. Since its founding, "Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood" has been the lemma of the Social Democratic Party of Denmark. In the [[United Kingdom]] the political party the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] refer to "the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community" in the preamble of the party's Federal Constitution, and this is printed on party membership cards.&lt;ref name="LDFC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Liberal Democrats |title=Federal Constitution |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/constitution.aspx |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]] |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that
consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty,
equality, and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace,
truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism
and valor . In the center of the white triangle is an eight-
rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's
democracy, and sovereignty.

The idea of the slogan "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" has also given an influence as [[natural law]] to the First Article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:

{{quote|All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter=Article 1 |title=The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Culture==
[[File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] of a state-owned [[Church (building)|church]]]]

At one point the motto was used to mark churches which were controlled by the state, rather than the Catholic Church.

Some former colonies of the French Republic (such as [[Haiti]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], and [[Gabon]]) have adopted similar three-word mottos.

The terms are also referred to in the film trilogy [[Three Colors]] by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]].

'''Male expendability''' is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman.

[[Øystein Gullvåg Holter]] argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovan War|Kosovo]], [[Timorese War|Timor]], [[Rwandan War|Rwanda]], and [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holter |first=Øystein Gullvåg |authorlink=Øystein Gullvåg Holter |title=A theory of gendercide |journal=[[Journal of Genocide Research]] |date=March 2002 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=11–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of [[sex object]] to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivana Milojević |title=Why the Creation of a Better World is Premised on Achieving Gender Equity and on Celebrating Multiple Gender Diversities |journal=[[Journal of Futures Studies]] |date=June 2012 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' or ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' often are about all-male combat teams.

In economics, '''marginal cost''' is the change in the [[opportunity cost]] that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the [[cost]] of producing one more unit of a good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = O'Sullivan| first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin| title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| page = 111| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, marginal cost at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered [[fixed cost|fixed]]. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the [[fixed cost]]s of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.

If the [[cost curve|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], the marginal cost &lt;math&gt;MC&lt;/math&gt; is the first derivative of the cost function with respect to the quantity &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Carl|last2=Blume|first2=Lawrence|title=Mathematics for Economists|date=1994|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0393957330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC(Q) = \frac{\ dC}{\ dQ}&lt;/math&gt;
The marginal cost can be a function of quantity if the cost function is non-linear.  If the cost function is not differentiable, the marginal cost can be expressed as follows.
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denotes an incremental change of one unit.

==Cost functions and relationship to average cost==
In the simplest case, the total cost function and its [[derivative]] are expressed as follows, where Q represents the production quantity, VC represents variable costs, FC represents [[fixed cost]]s and TC represents total costs.

Since (by definition) fixed costs do not vary with production quantity, it drops out of the equation when it is differentiated.  The important conclusion is that marginal cost ''is not related to'' fixed costs. This can be compared with [[average total cost]] or ATC, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced and ''does'' include fixed costs.

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=\frac{C_0 + \Delta C}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

For discrete calculation without calculus, marginal cost equals the change in total (or variable) cost that comes with each additional unit produced. In contrast, '''incremental cost''' is the composition of total cost from the surrogate of contributions, where any increment is determined by the contribution of the cost factors, not necessarily by single units.

For instance, suppose the total cost of making 1 shoe is $30 and the total cost of making 2 shoes is $40. The marginal cost of producing the second shoe is $40 – $30 = $10.

Marginal cost is not the cost of producing the "next" or "last" unit.&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg &amp; Suen, The Structure of Economics, A Mathematical Analysis 3rd ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 181.&lt;/ref&gt; As Silberberg and Suen note, the cost of the last unit is the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit. In the short run, increasing production requires using more of the variable input &amp;mdash; conventionally assumed to be labor. Adding more labor to a fixed capital stock reduces the marginal product of labor because of the [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]]. This reduction in productivity is not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit – the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced. Thus the costs of producing the marginal unit of output has two components:
the cost associated with producing the marginal unit
and the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the "damage" to the entire productive process (∂AC/∂q)q. 
The first component is the per unit or average cost. The second unit is the small increase in costs due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units of sold.

Marginal costs can also be expressed as the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labor.&lt;ref&gt;See http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2007/lecture-notes/14_01_lec13.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta VC = {w \Delta L}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w \Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of labor that affects a one unit change in output, this implies that this equals &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt;.

where MPL is the ratio of increase in the quantity produced per unit increase in labour i.e. ΔQ/ΔL.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chia-Hui Chen, course materials for 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics, Fall 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [12 Sept 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wage rate is assumed constant, marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship&amp;mdash;if marginal cost is increasing  (decreasing) the marginal product of labor is decreasing (increasing).&lt;ref&gt;Note also that AVC = VC/Q=wL/Q = w/(Q/L) OR w/AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economies of scale==
Economies of scale applies to the long run, a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs.  Production may be subject to [[economies of scale]] (or [[diseconomies of scale]]). Economies of scale are said to exist if an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units&amp;mdash; that is, if long-run marginal cost is below long-run average cost, so the latter is falling.  Conversely, there may be levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost, and the average cost is an increasing function of output.  For this generic case, minimum average cost occurs at the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal (when plotted, the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below); this point will ''not'' be at the minimum for marginal cost if fixed costs are greater than 0.

==Perfectly competitive supply curve==

The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]]. (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shutdown point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly "has" an MC curve it does not have a supply curve.  In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price – for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve.

==Decisions taken based on marginal costs==
In perfectly competitive markets, firms decide the quantity to be produced based on marginal costs and sale price. If the sale price is higher than the marginal cost, then they supply the unit and sell it. If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price. In other words, firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is greater than the market price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/glossary/refusaltosell.htm "Piana V. (2011), Refusal to sell - a key concept in Economics and Management, Economics Web Institute."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to fixed costs==

Marginal costs are not affected by changes in fixed cost. Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently, the profit-maximizing quantity and price would not change.  This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short-run variable cost curve. The shapes of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance of the origin of the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.

==Private versus social marginal cost==
{{main|Social cost}}
Of great importance in the theory of marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal ''private'' and ''social'' costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their [[profit maximization]] goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but ''also'' any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive [[externalities]], of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.

Externalities are costs (or benefits) that are not borne by the parties to the economic [[Financial transaction|transaction]]. A producer may, for example, [[pollution|pollute]] the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level.

===Negative externalities of production===
[[Image:NegativeExt.svg|thumb|right|Negative Externalities of Production]]

Much of the time, private and social costs do not diverge from one another, but at times social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When marginal social costs of production are greater than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[negative externality]] of production. Productive processes that result in [[pollution]] are a textbook example of production that creates negative externalities.

Such externalities are a result of firms externalizing their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalizing such costs, we see that members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, we see that an increased cost of production in society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.

In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed.

===Positive externalities of production===
[[Image:PositiveExt.svg|thumb|right|Positive Externalities of Production]]

When marginal social costs of production are less than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[positive externality]] of production. Production of [[public good]]s are a textbook example of production that create positive externalities. An example of such a public good, which creates a divergence in social and private costs, includes the production of [[education]]. It is often seen that education is a positive for any whole society, as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market.

Examining the relevant diagram we see that such production creates a social cost curve that is less than that of the private curve. In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating positive externalities of production will underproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed.

{{Main|History of Samoa}}

The '''Mau''' was a [[nonviolence|non-violent]] movement for [[Samoa]]n independence from [[colony|colonial]] rule during the first half of the 20th century. ''Mau'' means 'opinion,' 'unwavering,' 'to be decided,' or 'testimony' denoting 'firm strength' in [[Samoan language|Samoan]]. The motto for the Mau were the words '''Samoa mo Samoa''' (Samoa for the Samoans). Similarly in Hawaii'an ''Mau'' means to strive or persevere, and is often linked with Hawaii'an poetry relating to independence and sovereignty struggles.

The movement had its beginnings on the island of [[Savai'i]] with the ''Mau a Pule'' resistance in the early 1900s with widespread support throughout the country by the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/samoa/rise-of-mau |title=The rise of the Mau movement - NZ in Samoa &amp;#124; NZHistory.net.nz, New Zealand history online |publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the movement grew, leadership came under the country's chiefly elite, the customary ''[[Fa'amatai|matai]]'' leaders entrenched in Samoan tradition and [[fa'a Samoa]].&lt;ref name=aw&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WenGua-c4.html] Guardians of the West by Albert Wendt. Retrieved 21 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mau included women who supported the national organisation through leadership and organisation as well as taking part in marches. Supporters wore a Mau uniform of a navy blue [[lava-lava|lavalava]] with a white stripe which was later banned by the colonial administration.&lt;ref name=jc&gt;{{cite book

The Mau movement culminated on 28 December 1929 in the streets of the capital [[Apia]], when the [[New Zealand]] military police fired on a procession who were attempting to prevent the arrest of one of their members. The day became known as Black Saturday. Up to 11 Samoans were killed, including Mau leader and high chief [[Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III]] with many others wounded. One New Zealand constable was clubbed to death by protesters.&lt;ref name=nzetc&gt;{{cite web

The Mau movement's efforts would ultimately result in the political independence of Samoa in 1962 but the height of the movement's activity in the Western Islands occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

==History==
[[File:Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Exile [[Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe|Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe]] (photo by [[Thomas Andrew (photographer)|Thomas Andrew]]).]]

Broadly, the history of the Mau movement can be seen as beginning in the 19th century with European contact and the advent of Western  powers, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[United States]] and [[German Empire|Germany]], vying for control of the Pacific nation. The country became [[German Samoa]] (1900–1914) followed by [[New Zealand]] colonial rule during which the Mau gathered national support.  
 
{{quote|The Mau was a revolt of Old Samoa against foreign domination, and, therefore, originated in the nineteenth century. Samoan author and Professor [[Albert Wendt]].&lt;ref name=aw /&gt;}}

A key event occurred in 1908, in a dispute between the [[Germany|German]] colonial administration and the ''Malo o Samoa'', or Samoan Council of Chiefs, over the establishment of a [[copra]] business owned and controlled by native Samoans.

The dispute led to the eventual formation of a resistance movement called ''Mau a Pule'' on Savai'i by [[Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe|Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe]], one of the Samoan leaders from [[Safotulafai]] who was deposed by the German Governor of Samoa, [[Wilhelm Solf]]. As well as deposing members of the ''Malo o Samoa'', Solf called in two German warships as a show of strength. Lauaki returned with his warriors from Savai'i for battle. The German governor convinced Mata'afa to set up a "peace talk meeting" with Lauaki but that Lauaki had to disperse his army before the meeting. Unbeknown to Mata'afa was the intent of the German governor to rid of Lauaki. Lauaki, a man of honor, returned with his warriors to Savai'i as they were reluctant to leave Upolu without him. After ensuring his warriors' arrival to their villages, Lauaki returned to Upolu. As it took Lauaki several days to disperse his army, the German governor set up his trap. Days later upon their return to Upolu, Lauaki and some of the Chiefs were betrayed at this "peace talk", held aboard the German ship. In 1909, Lauaki and the other senior leaders of the ''Mau a Pule'' were exiled to the German colonies in the [[Marianas]] (North West Pacific) where they were to stay until 1914, when New Zealand took over Samoa as part of its Empire duties at the outbreak of World War I. Many of those exiled died before returning to Samoa. Lauaki died en route back to Samoa in 1915.

===Influenza epidemic===
[[File:Talune.jpg|thumb|right|200px|SS ''Talune'' in Port Chalmers graving dock in New Zealand c. 1890s]]
The Samoan independence movement would not gain strength again until after [[New Zealand]] forces, unopposed by the German rulers, annexed [[Western Samoa]] in 1914, at the beginning of [[World War I]]. Military rule continued after the war ended, and in 1919, some 7,500 Samoans, around 22 per cent of the population, died during an [[influenza]] epidemic. It was already known that Samoans were susceptible to the smallest European diseases, as they had never encountered them before. When the ship ''[[SS Talune]]'' arrived in Apia with its crew and passengers obviously sick with influenza, they were allowed to dock by the New Zealanders.

Two days later the first deaths were reported. No attempt was made by the New Zealand administrators to quell or contain the spread, and after one week it had spread through the whole of Samoa. Whole families were killed, with such alarming speed that corpses lay around for weeks without being buried. They were either thrown in mass graves or left in houses which were torched. However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the current situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Logan who was in charge; Logan was British born and hated Americans. He destroyed the telegram and cut off any other contact to American Samoa. The Americans had a large medical team who could have saved many lives.
 
This catastrophic event was to lay a new foundation for discontent with an administration already perceived as incompetent and dishonest by many Samoans. The clumsy handling of Samoa's governance, the slow and deliberate erosion of traditional Samoan social structures by successive administrators, and a general failure to understand and respect Samoan culture also sowed the seeds for a revitalised resistance to colonial rule. Logan was replaced by Colonel Robert Tate.

===Mau leadership===
[[File:Mau prisoners and sailors in Apia 1930.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mau prisoners being transported in the capital [[Apia]]]]
The groundswell of support among Samoans for the Mau came from the leadership of Samoan ''[[Fa'amatai|matai]]'', the heads of families in Samoa's traditional socio-political structure. Family and chiefly title connections, a central part of Samoan culture, were used to harness support. The success of the Mau in gathering national support showed that ''fa'a Samoa'' was still strong &lt;ref name=aw/&gt; despite [[colonialism]].

Samoans of mixed parentage, facing discrimination from both cultures but with the advantage of cross-cultural knowledge, also played a key role in the new movement.

[[Olaf Frederick Nelson]], one of the leaders of the new Mau movement, was a successful merchant of mixed [[Sweden|Swedish]] and Samoan heritage. Nelson was the richest man in Samoa at the time and well-travelled. He was frustrated by the colonial administration's exclusion of native and part-Samoans from governance. Notably, he was one of many who had lost a child to the influenza epidemic of 1919 in addition to his mother, sister, only brother, and sister in-law. Although classified as a European, he considered himself Samoan "by birth blood and sentiment."

In 1926, Nelson visited [[Wellington]] to lobby the New Zealand government on the issue of increased self-rule. During his visit, the Minister for External Affairs, [[William Nosworthy]], promised to visit Samoa to investigate. When Nosworthy postponed his trip, Nelson organised two public meetings in Apia, which were attended by hundreds, and The Samoan League, or ''O le Mau'', was formed.
[[File:NZ sailors removing white band, insignia of the Mau, from lavalava 1930.jpg|thumb|right|200px|New Zealand sailors removing the white strip from [[lava-lava]], the Mau uniform, circa 1930]]
The Mau published the ''Samoa Guardian'' newspaper as a mouthpiece for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2015/05/samoa-guardian.html Heritage et AL: Samoa Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the extent of popular support for the Mau, Nelson organised a sports meeting for movement members on the King's Birthday, in parallel with the official event, and held a well-attended ball at his home on the same night. Movement members had begun to engage in acts of noncooperation: neglecting the compulsory weekly search for the [[rhinoceros beetle]], enemy of the [[coconut]] palm, thereby threatening the lucrative copra industry. When New Zealand administrators imposed a per-capita beetle quota, many Samoan villages resisted by breeding the insects in tightly-woven baskets rather than comply with the orders to scour the forests and collect them.

In 1927, alarmed at the growing strength of the Mau, [[George Spafford Richardson|George Richardson]], the administrator of Samoa, changed the law to allow the deportation of Europeans or part-Europeans charged with fomenting unrest. This action was presumably taken on the assumption that the growing movement was merely a product of self-interested Europeans agitating the native Samoans.

In reality, however, the Mau was built upon the traditional forms of Samoan political organisation. In each village that joined the movement, a committee was formed, consisting of the chiefs and "talking men". These committees formed the basic element of an alternative system of governance, and the tendency of Samoans to unite under traditional leadership meant that by the mid- to late 1920s, around 85% of the Samoan population was involved in open resistance.

Following another visit to New Zealand to petition the Government, Nelson was exiled from Samoa along with two other part-European Mau leaders. The petition, which led to the formation of a joint select committee to investigate the situation in Samoa, quoted an ancient Samoan proverb: "We are moved by love, but never driven by intimidation."

===Civil disobedience===
The Mau remained true to this sentiment, and despite the exile of Nelson, continued to use [[civil disobedience]] to oppose the New Zealand administration. They boycotted imported products, [[Tax resistance|refused to pay taxes]] and formed their own "police force", picketing stores in Apia to prevent the payment of customs to the authorities. Village committees established by the administration ceased to meet and government officials were ignored when they went on tour. Births and deaths went unregistered. Coconuts went unharvested, and the banana plantations were neglected.

As the select committee was forced to admit, "a very substantial proportion of Samoans had joined the Mau, a number quite sufficient, if they determined to resist and thwart the activities of the Administration, to paralyse the functions of government."

Richardson sent a warship and a 70-strong force of marines to quell the largely non-violent resistance. 400 Mau members were arrested, but others responded by giving themselves up in such numbers that there were insufficient jail cells to detain them all, and the prisoners came and went as they pleased. One group of prisoners found themselves in a three-sided "cell" which faced the ocean, and were able to swim away to tend to their gardens and visit their families.

With his attempt at repression turning to ridicule, Richardson offered pardons to all those arrested; however, arrestees demanded to be dealt with by the court, and then refused to enter pleas to demonstrate their rejection of the court's jurisdiction.

===Black Saturday, 28 December 1929===
[[File:Mau demonstration in Apia 1929.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mau demonstration in Apia, 1929]]
The new administrator, [[Stephen Allen (New Zealand)|Stephen Allen]], replaced the marines with a special force of New Zealand police, and began to target the leaders of the movement.

[[Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III]], who had led the movement following the exile of Nelson, was arrested for non-payment of taxes and imprisoned for six months.

On 28 December 1929 — which would be known thereafter as "Black Saturday" — New Zealand military police fired upon a peaceful demonstration which had assembled to welcome home [[A.G. Smyth]], a European movement leader returning to Samoa after a two-year exile. Reports of the massacre are sketchy because the official cover-up for the incident was so effective. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III had rushed to the front of the crowd and turned to face his people; he called for peace from them because some were throwing stones at the police. With his back to the police calling for peace he was shot in the back; another Samoan who rushed to help him was shot in both legs while cradling his head. Another who had attempted to shield his body from the bullets was shot. Two more rushing to help were killed before they could reach him.

Shooting stopped at around 6.30 am. Eight had died, three would later die, and about 50 were wounded. One policeman had also been clubbed to death.

Among the wounded were terrified women and children who had fled to a market place for cover from New Zealand police firing from the verandah of the station, one of them wielding a Lewis machine-gun.

As he lay dying, Tamesese III made this statement to his followers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My blood has been spilt for Samoa. I am proud to give it. Do not dream of avenging it, as it was spilt in peace. If I die, peace must be maintained at any price.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gravestone of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, Samoa.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Grave of [[Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III]] in [[Lepea]] village with inscription of his last words in the [[Samoan language]].]]

Following the massacre, male Mau members fled to the mountains, the traditional retreat of those defeated in war. The resistance continued by other means, with the emergence of a women's Mau to continue the councils, parades and symbolic protests that the men now could not. For the women's movement, even the game of [[cricket]] represented an act of defiance inviting official harassment.
[[File:Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III lying in state at Vaimoso 1930 - AJ Tattersall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III lying in state at Vaimoso village, 1930.]]
The day after his funeral, his village was raided by New Zealand military police; they ransacked houses, including those of the Tamasese's mourning widow and children. Colonel Allen requested reinforcements from New Zealand after he claimed 2000 Mau had caused a riot. On 12 January 1930 the Royal New Zealand Navy flagship ''Dunedin'' brought marines to hunt down members of The Mau. The Mau, who were fully committed to Passive Resistance, easily slipped through the jungle; the marines were slow because they were carrying too much weaponry and didn't know the bush like The Mau. The Mau no longer trusted New Zealand police, and this fear only got worse after a 16-year-old un-armed Samoan was shot and killed while running away from a marine, whose excuse he thought the boy was going to throw a stone was accepted as an adequate defence and no charges were laid.

A truce was declared on 12 March 1930, after another child was killed by New Zealand marines who were now suffering heat exhaustion and tropical infections. The male Mau members returned to their homes, on the condition that they retain their right to engage in non-cooperation. Meanwhile, Nelson and other exiled leaders continued to lobby the New Zealand Government and communicate their progress to the Mau. In 1931, news of the growing resistance to the British rule of [[India]] reached many Samoan villages.

==Moving towards independence==

The Mau movement had not gone unnoticed by the population of New Zealand, and the treatment of Samoans at the hands of the administration had become a contentious issue in some New Zealand electorates during the 1929 election. 1936 marked a turning point for Samoa, with the election of a [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Government]] in New Zealand and the subsequent relaxation of  repression by the Samoan administration. Under the new Government, there was slow movement towards greater involvement of Samoans in the administration of their own country.

==1962 independence==
When Western Samoa gained its independence in 1962, Tupua Tamasese Meaole, son of the Mau movement leader, became its first co-head of state with [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]].

[[Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II]] (1921–1975), the son of another high chief and Mau leader [[Mata'afa Faumuina Fiame Mulinu'u I]], became the first [[Prime Minister of Samoa]].

In July 1997, the Samoa Constitution was amended to change the country's name to Samoa, and officially the Independent State of Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1842.htm |title=Samoa |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand apology to Samoa===
In 2002, [[Helen Clark]], Prime Minister of New Zealand made an unprecedented move and apologised to Samoa for New Zealand's treatment of Samoans during the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2025041.stm | work=BBC News | title=Apology to Samoa surprises New Zealand | date=4 June 2002 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark made the apology in the capital [[Apia]] during the 40th anniversary of Samoa's independence. The apology covered the influenza epidemic of 1918, the shooting of unarmed Mau protesters by New Zealand police in 1929 and the banishing of matai (chiefs) from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/tapu-misa/news/article.cfm?a_id=11&amp;objectid=2044999 |title=Emotions high as Clark seeks closure in Samoa - Tapu Misa - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2002-06-05 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An American Samoa Mau==
The Mau had manifestations in both the Western and Eastern Samoan island groups.
The Mau movement emerged as an articulated of an indigenous response to the U.S. annexation of the eastern Samoan islands in 1899. It featured the signing of petitions in efforts to enact political transformation vis-a-vis American colonial government, and included effort to resist taxation of copra.

There was an American Samoa Mau that took place in Tutuila in [[American Samoa]] in the 1920s. It emerged as a result of fluctuating prices of copra and represented an open affront to the American Navy and its patterns of treatment of the indigenous Samoan people and failure to respect Samoan customs, conceptions of self-government and the Samoan way of life.
This movement received a lot of press in the United States, both favourable and unfavourable. The leader of the movement, Samuel Ripley of Leone, Tutuila, was in effect exiled from American Samoa, when he was barred by the US Navy authorities from disembarking from a ship returning to Pagopago from California, and he was never allowed to return to his homeland. He eventually became the mayor of Richmond, California. The United States sent a committee to American Samoa in 1930, including US citizens from [[Hawaii]] who had a prominent role in the overthrow of the [[Hawaiian kingdom]] and [[Queen Lili'uokalani]]. Their report, favourable to the US position, had a considerable influence on US policy, and the American Samoa Mau was totally suppressed by the US. Its influence however continued to be felt.

==Contemporary influences==
A Samoan hip hop group that was founded in 1990 by Kosmo, MC Kha [[Tha Feelstyle]] Orator and DJ Rockit V. The Mau was named for the Mau movement. The motto of the group became the same as the motto of the Mau movement; Samoa Mo Samoa, or Samoa for Samoans. The Mau has now reformed as the group Rough Opinion. The group still carries the message of the Mau movement as their theme.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, April K. "Dancing Between Islands: Hip Hop and the Samoan Diaspora."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51459">'''Modal logic''' is a type of [[mathematical logic#Formal logic|formal logic]] primarily developed in the 1960s that extends classical [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[predicate logic]] to include operators expressing [[Linguistic modality|modality]]. A modal—a word that expresses a modality—qualifies a statement. For example, the statement "John is happy" might be qualified by saying that John is [[usually]] happy, in which case the term "usually" is functioning as a modal. The traditional [[alethic modality|alethic modalities]], or modalities of truth, include [[Logical possibility|possibility]] ("Possibly, ''p''", "It is possible that ''p''"), necessity ("Necessarily, ''p''", "It is necessary that ''p''"), and impossibility ("Impossibly, ''p''", "It is impossible that ''p''").&lt;ref&gt;"Formal Logic", by A. N. Prior, Oxford Univ. Press, 1962, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Other modalities that have been formalized in modal logic include [[Temporal Logic|temporal]] modalities, or modalities of time (notably, "It was the case that ''p''", "It has always been that ''p''", "It will be that ''p''", "It will always be that ''p''"),&lt;ref&gt;"Temporal Logic", by Rescher and Urquhart, Springer-Verlag, 1971, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Past, Present and Future", by A. N. Prior, Oxford Univ. Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deontic logic|deontic]] modalities (notably, "It is obligatory that ''p''", and "It is permissible that ''p''"), [[Epistemic logic|epistemic]] modalities, or modalities of knowledge ("It is known that ''p''")&lt;ref&gt;"Knowledge and Belief", by Jaakko Hinntikka, Cornell Univ. Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doxastic logic|doxastic]] modalities, or modalities of belief ("It is believed that ''p''").&lt;ref&gt;"Topics in Philosophical Logic", by N. Rescher, Humanities Press, 1968, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A formal modal logic represents modalities using [[modal operator]]s. For example, "It might rain today" and "It is possible that rain will fall today" both contain the notion of possibility. In a modal logic this is represented as an operator, "Possibly", attached to the sentence "It will rain today".

It is fallacious to confuse necessity and possibility. In particular, this is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

The basic [[Unary operation|unary]] (1-place) modal operators are usually written "□" for "Necessarily" and "◇" for "Possibly". In a [[classical modal logic]], each can be expressed by the other with [[negation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Diamond P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Box \lnot P;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Box P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Diamond \lnot P.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus it is ''possible'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not necessary'' that it will ''not'' rain today, and it is ''necessary'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not possible'' that it will ''not'' rain today. Alternative symbols used for the modal operators are "L" for "Necessarily" and "M" for "Possibly".&lt;ref&gt;So in the standard work ''A New Introduction to Modal Logic'', by G. E. Hughes and  M. J. Cresswell, Routledge, 1996, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of modal logic==
In addition to his non-modal syllogistic, [[Aristotle]] also developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (chs 8–22), which [[Theophrastus]] attempted to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=logic-ancient |title=Ancient Logic |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with [[potentiality]] and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians [[Diodorus Cronus]], [[Philo the Dialectician]] and the Stoic [[Chrysippus]] each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom '''T''' (see [[#Axiomatic systems|below]]), and combined elements of modal logic and [[temporal logic]] in attempts to solve the notorious [[Diodorus Cronus#Master Argument|Master Argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobzien, S. (1993). "Chrysippus' Modal Logic and its Relation to Philo and Diodorus", in K. Doering &amp; Th. Ebert (eds), ''Dialektiker und Stoiker'', Stuttgart 1993, pp. 63–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] modal" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]].

[[C. I. Lewis]] founded modern modal logic in his 1910 Harvard thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type=Ph.D. thesis | url= | author=Clarence Irving Lewis | title=The Place of Intuition in Knowledge | institution=Harvard University | year=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912. This work culminated in his 1932 book ''Symbolic Logic'' (with [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= | isbn= | author=Clarence Irving Lewis and Cooper Harold Langford | title=Symbolic Logic  | location= | publisher=Dover Publications | edition=1st | year=1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the five systems ''S1'' through ''S5''.

Ruth C. Barcan (later [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]]) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic — first and second order extensions of Lewis' ''S2'', ''S4'', and ''S5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ruth C. Barcan | title=A Functional Calculus of First Order  Based on Strict Implication | journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=11 | number=1 | pages=1&amp;mdash;16 | date=Mar 1946 | doi=10.2307/2269159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ruth C.

Barcan | title=The Identity of Individuals in a  Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order | journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=12 | number=1 | pages=12&amp;mdash;15 | date=Mar 1947 | doi=10.2307/2267171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when [[Saul Kripke]] (then only a 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] undergraduate) introduced the now-standard [[Kripke semantics]] for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as "possible worlds" semantics. Kripke and [[A. N. Prior]] had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or [[analytic tableaux]], as explained by [[Evert Willem Beth|E. W. Beth]].

[[A. N. Prior]] created modern [[temporal logic]], closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators [F] and [P] meaning "eventually" and "previously". [[Vaughan Pratt]] introduced [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] in 1976. In 1977, [[Amir Pnueli]] proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include [[propositional dynamic logic]] (PDL), [[propositional linear temporal logic]] (PLTL), [[linear temporal logic]] (LTL), [[computation tree logic]] (CTL), [[Hennessy–Milner logic]], and ''T''.{{clarify|reason=Add a wikilink, give a longer name, or give a reference for the 'T' logic.|date=November 2016}}

The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s augmented with [[unary operation]]s (often called [[modal algebra]]s), began to emerge with [[J.C.C. McKinsey|J. C. C. McKinsey]]'s 1941 proof that ''S2'' and ''S4'' are decidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKinsey, J. C. C.|title=A Solution of the Decision Problem for the Lewis Systems S2 and S4, with an Application to Topology|journal=J. Symb. Log.|year=1941|volume=6|issue=4|pages=117–134|jstor=2267105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached full flower in the work of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his student [[Bjarni Jónsson]] (Jónsson and Tarski 1951–52). This work revealed that ''S4'' and ''S5'' are models of [[interior algebra]], a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the [[interior operator|interior]] and [[closure operator]]s of [[topology]]. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[topology]]. For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see [[Robert Goldblatt]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldbaltt, [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~rob/papers/modalhist.pdf Mathematical Modal Logic: A view of it evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==

===Model theory===
The semantics for modal logic are usually given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fitting and Mendelsohn. ''First-Order Modal Logic''. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998. Section 1.6&lt;/ref&gt; First we define a ''frame'', which consists of a non-empty set, ''G'', whose members are generally called possible worlds, and a binary relation, ''R'', that holds (or not) between the possible worlds of ''G''. This binary relation is called the ''[[accessibility relation]]''.  For example, ''w R u'' means that the  world ''u'' is accessible from world ''w''. That is to say, the state of affairs known as ''u'' is a live possibility for ''w''. This gives a pair, &lt;math&gt;\langle G, R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Some formulations of modal logic also include a constant term in ''G'', conventionally called "the actual world", which is often symbolized as &lt;math&gt;w*&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, the ''frame'' is extended to a ''model'' by specifying the [[truth-value]]s of all propositions at each of the worlds in ''G''. We do so by defining a relation ''v'' between possible worlds and positive literals. If there is a world ''w'' such that &lt;math&gt;v(w, P)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''P'' is true at ''w''. A model is thus an ordered triple, &lt;math&gt;\langle G, R, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world in a model:

* if &lt;math&gt;v(w, P)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;w \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \neg P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w \not \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models (P \wedge Q) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w \models P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w \models Q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \Box P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every element ''u'' of ''G'', if ''w R u'' then &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that ''w R u'' and &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\models P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w* \models P&lt;/math&gt;

According to these semantics, a truth is ''necessary'' with respect to a possible world ''w'' if it is true at every world that is accessible to ''w'', and ''possible'' if it is true at some world that is accessible to ''w''. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation ''R'', which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is ''another'' world accessible from ''those'' worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.

It should also be noted that the definition of □ makes vacuously true certain sentences, since when it speaks of "every world that is accessible to ''w''" it takes for granted the usual mathematical interpretation of the word "every" (see [[vacuous truth]]). Hence, if a world ''w'' doesn't have any accessible worlds, any sentence beginning with □ is true.

The different systems of modal logic are distinguished by the properties of their corresponding accessibility relations. There are several systems that have been espoused (often called ''frame conditions''). An accessibility relation is:

* '''[[reflexive relation|reflexive]]''' [[iff]] ''w R w'', for every ''w'' in ''G''
* '''[[symmetric relation|symmetric]]''' iff ''w R u'' implies ''u R w'', for all ''w'' and ''u'' in ''G''
* '''[[transitive relation|transitive]]''' iff ''w R u'' and ''u R q'' together imply ''w R q'', for all ''w'', ''u'', ''q'' in ''G''.
* '''[[serial relation|serial]]''' iff, for each ''w'' in ''G'' there is some ''u'' in ''G'' such that ''w R u''.
* '''[[euclidean relation|Euclidean]]''' iff, for every ''u'', ''t'', and ''w'', ''w R u'' and ''w R t'' implies ''u R t'' (note that it also implies: ''t R u'')

The logics that stem from these frame conditions are:
*'''K''' := no conditions
*'''D''' := serial
*'''T''' := reflexive
*'''B''' := reflexive and symmetric
*'''S4''' := [[preorder|reflexive and transitive]]
*'''S5''' := reflexive and [[euclidean relation|Euclidean]]

The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. (The Euclidean property can be obtained, as well, from symmetry and transitivity.) Hence if the accessibility relation ''R'' is reflexive and Euclidean, ''R'' is provably [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] as well. Hence for models of S5, ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]], because ''R'' is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of ''W'' (''i.e.'', where ''R'' is a "total" relation). This gives the corresponding ''modal graph'' which is total complete (''i.e.'', no more edges (relations) can be added). For example, in any modal logic based on frame conditions:
: &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt; and ''w R u''.

If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that
: &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;.
We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all ''w'' and ''u'' that ''w R u''. But note that this does not have to be the case in all S5 frames, which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other.

All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms &lt;math&gt;P \implies \Box\Diamond P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Box P \implies \Box\Box P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box P \implies P&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to ''symmetry'', ''transitivity'' and ''reflexivity'', respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics.

===Axiomatic systems===
The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic. Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since [[C. I. Lewis]] began working in the area in 1910. [[George Edward Hughes|Hughes]] and [[Max John Cresswell|Cresswell]] (1996), for example, describe 42 [[normal modal logic|normal]] and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit.

Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the [[propositional calculus]] with two unary operations, one denoting "necessity" and the other "possibility". The notation of [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]], much employed since, denotes "necessarily ''p''" by a prefixed "box" (□''p'') whose scope is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed "diamond" (◇''p'') denotes "possibly ''p''". Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic:
* □''p'' (necessarily ''p'') is equivalent to {{math|¬◇¬''p''}} ("not possible that not-''p''")
* ◇''p'' (possibly ''p'') is equivalent to {{math|¬□¬''p''}} ("not necessarily not-''p''")
Hence □ and ◇ form a [[duality (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual pair]] of operators.

In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of [[de Morgan's laws]] from [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]:

:"It is '''not necessary that''' ''X''" is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to "It is '''possible that not''' ''X''".
:"It is '''not possible that''' ''X''" is logically equivalent to "It is '''necessary that not''' ''X''".

Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the [[propositional calculus]] to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model.  Many modal logics, known collectively as [[normal modal logic]]s, include the following rule and axiom:
* '''N''', '''Necessitation Rule''': If ''p'' is a [[theorem]] (of any system invoking '''N'''), then □''p'' is likewise a theorem.
* '''K''', '''Distribution Axiom''': {{math|□(''p'' → ''q'') → (□''p'' → □''q'').}}

The weakest [[normal modal logic]], named ''K'' in honor of [[Saul Kripke]], is simply the [[propositional calculus]] augmented by □, the rule '''N''', and the axiom '''K'''. ''K'' is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of ''K'' that if □''p'' is true then □□''p'' is true, i.e., that necessary truths are "necessarily necessary". If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of ''K'' is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic.

Adding axioms to ''K'' gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in ''K'' that if "''p'' is necessary" then ''p'' is true. The axiom '''T''' remedies this defect:
*'''T''', '''Reflexivity Axiom''': {{math|□''p'' → ''p''}} (If ''p'' is necessary, then ''p'' is the case.) 
'''T''' holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as ''S1&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Other well-known elementary axioms are:
*'''4''': &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Box \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''B''': &lt;math&gt; p \to \Box \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''D''': &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''5''': &lt;math&gt; \Diamond p \to \Box \Diamond p &lt;/math&gt;

These yield the systems (axioms in bold, systems in italics):
*''K'' := '''K''' + '''N'''
*''T'' := ''K'' + '''T'''
*''S4'' := ''T'' + '''4'''
*''S5'' :=  ''S4'' + '''5'''
*''D'' := ''K'' + '''D'''.
''K'' through ''S5'' form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of [[normal modal logic]]. But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in deontic logic, &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; (If it ought to be that ''p'', then it is permitted that ''p'') seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that &lt;math&gt; p \to \Box \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, to do so is to commit the [[naturalistic fallacy]] (i.e. to state that what is natural is also good, by saying that if ''p'' is the case, ''p'' ought to be permitted).

The commonly employed system ''S5'' simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if ''p'' is possible, then it is "necessary" that ''p'' is possible. Also, if ''p'' is necessary, then it is necessary that ''p'' is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because ''S5'' does not describe every kind of modality of interest.

===Structural proof theory===
Sequent calculi and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics, but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good [[structural proof theories]], such as purity (the proof theory does not introduce extra-logical notions such as labels) and analyticity (the logical rules support a clean notion of [[analytic proof]]).  More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality.

===Decision methods===
[[Analytic tableaux]] provide the most popular decision method for modal logics.

==Alethic logic==
{{main|Alethic modality}}
Modalities of necessity and possibility are called ''alethic'' modalities.  They are also sometimes called ''special'' modalities, from the [[Latin]] ''species''. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others.  For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as ''the'' subject matter of modal logic. Moreover, it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, nomological, epistemic, and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions.

In [[classical modal logic]], a proposition is said to be
*'''possible''' if it is ''not necessarily false'' (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false);
*'''necessary''' if it is ''not possibly false'' (i.e. true and necessarily true);
*'''contingent''' if it is ''not necessarily false'' and ''not necessarily true'' (i.e. possible but not necessarily true);
*'''impossible''' if it is ''not possibly true'' (i.e. false and necessarily false).

In classical modal logic, therefore, the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of [[De Morgan duality]]. [[Intuitionistic modal logic]] treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric.

For example, suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich's house, and observe that the lights are off. On the way back, we observe that they have been turned on.
* "Somebody or something turned the lights on" is ''necessary''.
* "Friedrich turned the lights on", "Friedrich's roommate Max turned the lights on" and "A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich's house and turned the lights on" are ''contingent''.
* All of the above statements are ''possible''.
* It is ''impossible'' that [[Socrates]] (who has been dead for over two thousand years) turned the lights on.
(Of course, this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a ''truly'' rigorous fashion; for it to do so, it would have to axiomatically make such statements as "human beings cannot rise from the dead", "Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire", and "we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on", ''ad infinitum''. Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as "it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides" and "all bachelors are unmarried".)

For those with difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple "possible worlds" (in the sense of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) or "alternate universes"; something "necessary" is true in all possible worlds, something "possible" is true in at least one possible world.  These "possible world semantics" are formalized with [[Kripke semantics]].

===Physical possibility===
Something is physically, or nomically, possible if it is permitted by the [[physical law|laws of physics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} For example, current theory is thought to allow for there to be an [[atom]] with an [[atomic number]] of 126,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Superheavy Element 114 Confirmed: A Stepping Stone to the Island of Stability|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2009/09/24/114-confirmed/|work=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|date=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if there are no such atoms in existence.  In contrast, while it is logically possible (i.e. probably via [[Alcubierre drive]] or [[worm holes]]){{Clarify|date=February 2014}} to accelerate beyond the [[speed of light]],&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=G. |year=1967 |title=Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=1089–1105 |bibcode=1967PhRv..159.1089F |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089}} See also Feinberg's later paper: Phys. Rev. D 17, 1651 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = Albert | authorlink = Albert Einstein | title = Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 17 | pages = 891–921 | date = 1905-06-30|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..891E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19053221004 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical possibility===
[[Philosophers]]{{who|date=April 2012}} ponder the properties that objects have independently of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate [[physicalism]] have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stoljar|first1=Daniel|title=Physicalism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can experience the passage of [[time]]. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Kripke. ''Naming and Necessity''. Harvard University Press, 1980. pg 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Judith and Alex Byrne|title=Content and Modality : Themes from the Philosophy of Robert Stalnaker|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXeOkXnCwb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers{{who|date=April 2012}} also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely "by definition", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.

==Epistemic logic==
{{Main|Epistemic logic}}

'''Epistemic modalities''' (from the Greek ''episteme'', knowledge), deal with the ''certainty'' of sentences.  The □ operator is translated as  "x knows that…", and the ◇ operator is translated as "For all x knows, it may be true that…"  In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help:

A person, Jones, might reasonably say ''both'': (1) "No, it is ''not'' possible that [[Bigfoot]] exists; I am quite certain of that"; ''and'', (2) "Sure, it's ''possible'' that Bigfoots could exist". What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the ''metaphysical'' claim that it is ''possible for'' Bigfoot to exist, ''even though he does not'': there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, "it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad" is ''metaphysically'' true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not ''alethically'' true unless you match that description, and not ''epistemically'' true if it's known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed.

From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) "It is ''possible'' that [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true; but also ''possible'' that it is false", and ''also'' (4) "if it ''is'' true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false". Here Jones means that it is ''epistemically possible'' that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there ''is'' a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not ''logically'' possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of ''alethic'' possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself.  It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach's conjecture is both true and unprovable.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Goldbach's conjecture#Origins|Goldbach's conjecture – Origins]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world ''might have been,'' but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world ''may be'' (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me "it is ''possible that'' it is raining outside" – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that "it is ''possible for'' it to rain outside" – in the sense of ''metaphysical possibility'' – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.

Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if ''x'' knows that ''p'', does ''x'' know that it knows that ''p''? That is to say, should □''P'' → □□''P'' be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Blindsight]] and [[Subliminal perception]] for negative empirical evidence&lt;/ref&gt; there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see [[Modal logic#Axiomatic systems|the section on axiomatic systems]]):
* '''K''', ''Distribution Axiom'': &lt;math&gt; \Box (p \to q) \to (\Box p \to \Box q)&lt;/math&gt;.

It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between "the truth in the world" (alethic) and "the truth in an individual's mind" (epistemic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Eschenroeder |first=Erin |author2=Sarah Mills |author3=Thao Nguyen |title=The Expression of Modality|editor=William Frawley|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter| date=2006-09-30 |series=The Expression of Cognitive Categories|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=72URszHq2SEC&amp;pg=PT18| isbn=3-11-018436-2 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a [[grammatical mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuyts|first=Jan|title=Epimestic Modality, Language, and Conceptualization: A Cognitive-pragmatic Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co|date=November 2000|series=Human Cognitive Processing|page=28|isbn=90-272-2357-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal logic==
{{Main|Temporal logic}}

Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with [[Grammatical tense|tense]], that is, expressions with qualifications of when.  Some expressions, such as  '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes.

In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use ''two'' pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example:

:'''F'''''P'' : It will sometimes be the case that ''P''
:'''G'''''P'' : It will always be the case that ''P''
:'''P'''''P'' : It was sometime the case that ''P''
:'''H'''''P'' : It has always been the case that ''P''

There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' is the case at some time ''t''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' is the case at every time ''t''

Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond_1 P &lt;/math&gt; = '''F'''''P''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box_1 P &lt;/math&gt; = '''G'''''P''

or,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond_2 P&lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' and/or '''F'''''P''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box_2 P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' and '''G'''''P''

The operators '''F''' and '''G''' may seem initially foreign, but they create [[normal modal logic|normal modal systems]]. Note that '''F'''''P'' is the same as ¬'''G'''¬''P''. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, '''P'''''P'' → □'''P'''''P'' says (effectively), ''Everything that is past and true is necessary''.

It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it won't; on the other hand, since we can't change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it probably isn't true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is "fixed", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as [[accidental necessity]]. But if the past is "fixed", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too.

Similarly, the [[problem of future contingents]] considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true?  Considering this thesis led [[Aristotle]] to reject the [[principle of bivalence]] for assertions concerning the future.

Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics, ''q.v.'' [[Linear Temporal Logic]].

Versions of temporal logic can be used in [[computer science]] to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ◇''P'' means "at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true"; □''P'' means "at all future times in the computation P will be true". In another version, ◇''P'' means "at the immediate next state of the computation, ''P'' might be true"; □''P'' means "at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true". These differ in the choice of [[Accessibility relation]]. (P always means "P is true at the current computer state".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms.

==Deontic logic==
{{Main|Deontic logic}}

Likewise talk of morality, or of [[obligation]] and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] generally, seems to have a modal structure.  The difference between "You must do this" and "You may do this" looks a lot like the difference between "This is necessary" and "This is possible".  Such logics are called ''[[deontic logic|deontic]]'', from the Greek for "duty".

Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom '''T''' semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in [[Kripke semantics]]: in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\Box\phi\to\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Interpreting □ as "it is obligatory that", '''T''' informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then '''T''' implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false.

Instead, using [[Kripke semantics]], we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., '''T''' holds at these worlds). These worlds are called idealized worlds. ''P'' is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, ''P'' holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Hansson |title=Ideal Worlds—Wishful Thinking in Deontic Logic |journal=Studia Logica |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=329–336 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11225-006-8100-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is ''D'', &lt;math&gt;\Box\phi\to\Diamond\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that "ought implies can". (Clearly the "can" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.)

===Intuitive problems with deontic logic===
When we try and formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition ''K'': you have stolen some money, and another, ''Q'': you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that "if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money". There are two likely candidates,
: (1) &lt;math&gt;(K \to \Box Q)&lt;/math&gt;
: (2) &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to Q)&lt;/math&gt;

But (1) and ''K'' together entail □''Q'', which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely isn't right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) doesn't work either: If the right representation of "if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount" is (2), then the right representation of (3) "if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount" is &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to (K \land \lnot Q))&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or &lt;math&gt;\Box \lnot K&lt;/math&gt;. But then we can deduce &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to (K \land \lnot Q))&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\Box (\lnot K) \to \Box (K \to K \land \lnot K)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \land \lnot K \to (K \land \lnot Q)) &lt;/math&gt; (the [[contrapositive]] of &lt;math&gt;Q \to K&lt;/math&gt;); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that can't be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Sider's ''Logic for Philosophy'', unknown page. http://tedsider.org/books/lfp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doxastic logic ==
{{Main|Doxastic logic}}

''Doxastic logic'' concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] ''doxa'' which means "belief". Typically, a doxastic logic uses □, often written "B", to mean "It is believed that", or when relativized to a particular agent s, "It is believed by s that".

==Other modal logics==
{{See also|Intensional logic}}
Significantly, modal logics can be developed to accommodate most of these idioms; it is the fact of their common logical structure (the use of "intensional" sentential operators) that make them all varieties of the same thing.

== The ontology of possibility ==
{{Further| Accessibility relation|Possible worlds}}
In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers "[[logically possible]] worlds". If a statement is true in all [[possible worlds]], then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.

Under this "possible worlds idiom," to maintain that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, "There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist". However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? [[Saul Kripke]] believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer – that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity''. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 43–5.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the sentences "you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6" and "there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world" are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity''. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as ''actual'' is simply that it is indeed our world – ''[[Indexicality|this]]'' world.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis, ''On the Plurality of Worlds'' (1986; Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt; That position is a major tenet of "[[modal realism]]". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2214751 ''Theories of Actuality'']. Noûs, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), particularly pp. 225–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed.  In place of "all worlds", you may have "all possible next states of the computer", or "all possible future states of the computer".

==Controversies==
[[Nicholas Rescher]] has argued that [[Bertrand Russell]] rejected modal logic, and that this rejection led to the theory of modal logic languishing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Bertrand Russell Memorial Volume|year=1979|publisher=George Allen and Unwin|location=London|pages=146|editor=George W. Roberts|chapter=Russell and Modal Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jan Dejnozka]] has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls ''MDL'' is described in Russell's works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to "come from confusing propositions with [[propositional function]]s," as he wrote in ''The Analysis of Matter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dejnozka |first=Jan|title=Ontological Foundations of Russell's Theory of Modality|journal=Erkenntnis| year=1990| volume=32| pages=383–418 |url=http://www.members.tripod.com/~Jan_Dejnozka/onto_found_russell_modality.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-22|doi=10.1007/bf00216469}}; quote is cited from {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=The Analysis of Matter|year=1927|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Norman Prior]] warned [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], due to the biases against modal logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], ''Modalities: Philosophical Essays'', Oxford University Press, 1993, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12845">'''NAACP in Kentucky''' is very active with branches all over the state, largest being in Louisville and Lexington.  The Kentucky State Conference of NAACP continues today to fight against injustices and for the equality of all people.

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] was founded in 1909 as a civil rights organization for African-Americans during some of the most violent times of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the [[United States]].  With locations across the United States, it grew to ensure the rights for all people within the country no matter race or ethnicity: "to fight for social justice for all Americans.".&lt;ref&gt;"Our Mission." National Association for the Advancement of Colored     People. Accessed 16 November 2010. [http://www.naacp.org/pages/our-mission http://www.naacp.org/pages/our-mission].&lt;/ref&gt;  Branches are set up in different states and work together for the common goal of equality.  There are also different branches within the states.  In Kentucky, there are over 55 branches located throughout the entire state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kynaacp.org/localunit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the NAACP in Kentucky==

Kentuckians played a large role in the NAACP. [[William English Walling]] from [[Louisville, Kentucky]] (1877–1936), an American labor reformer and socialist educated at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Hull House]] and [[Harvard Law School]], brought his interest in [[women's rights]] to his work with the [[American Federation of Labor]] and founded the [[National Women's Trade Union League]].  A few years later, the [[Springfield race riot of 1908|Springfield Race Riot of 1908]] in Illinois informed his work with [[Mary White Ovington]] and [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]] to form the NAACP.

The Kentucky branch of the NAACP gained national recognition as early as 1940 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].  The NAACP had already supported several court cases to protest the unequal pay of African Americans teachers.  Vallateen Virginia Dudley Abbington (1907–2003), one of several school teachers in Louisville who petitioned against the differential in pay, became a plaintiff in a NAACP suit argued by [[Thurgood Marshall]] that led to the removal of a 15 percent salary discrepancy between black and white teachers in the Louisville public schools. The case, Abbington v Board of Education of Louisville (KY), filed on December 5, 1940, caused the School board to agree to equal pay, but only if Mrs. Abbington from Jackson Junior High School dropped the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/NKAA/record.php?note_id=1790&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dropped and the salaries of teachers in Louisville no longer differed on the basis of race.&lt;ref&gt;For more see Papers of the NAACP, Part 3, The Campaign for Educational Equality: Legal Department and Central Office Records, 1913–1950 / Series B, 1940–1950 / Reel 8; see "Kentucky Cases" in The Negro Handbook 1946–1947, edited by F. Murray; "Alumna, 96, remembered as strong-willed activist," Exemplar (Eastern Michigan University), Winter 2004, Special Annual Report Issue; and "Vallateen Abbington, social worker, civic leader," St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 10/19/2003, Metro section, p.

The Kentucky branch of the NAACP also fought against other discrimination through the [[civil rights movement]] and beyond.  In the case of Eilers ''v.'' Eilers, attorney James Crumlin, Sr. of the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], helped Anna sue for custody of her five children from her ex-husband, George Eilers of [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=kLgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22anna+frances+anderson%22&amp;ei=tZJ3Sd3vBIPKkQSXx8W8Bg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anna%20frances%20anderson%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/NKAA/record.php?note_id=8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 Eilers had successfully sued his former wife (a white woman from [[New Haven, Kentucky]]) after she married Marshall C. Anderson, an African American man, gaining custody of their children since interracial marriage was illegal in Kentucky at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Frances Eilers (now Anna Anderson), Appellant, ''v.'' George F. Eilers, Appellee, Court of Appeals of Kentucky, 412 S.W.2d 871: 1967 Ky, March 17, 1967. See the "Eilers v. Eilers" entry in the [http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/NKAA/subject.php?sub_id=153 Notable Kentucky African Americans] Database, University of Kentucky Libraries, Lexington, Kentucky.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important leadership role of the NAACP in Kentucky was in the 1970s when the NAACP of Louisville and the [[Suzy Post|Kentucky Civil Liberties Union]] worked together to fight [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the Jefferson County Public Schools.&lt;ref&gt;See more on this in [[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]], [[Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education]] and John E.

==Women in the Kentucky NAACP==

Women had leadership roles in the state and local branches.   Osceola A.

With the help of Julia Etta Lewis, Grevious was able to join the Lexington [[Congress of Racial Equality]] together to increase their efforts towards equality.  Other notable African American women in Kentucky's NAACP throughout history include:

&lt;/ref&gt;

Women within the Kentucky branches of the NAACP also received several notable awards in the organization such as the NAACP Magistrate Daniel Massie award for NAACP Involvement Above and Beyond the Call of Duty and the NAACP Herman E. Floyd Award along with other community awards for their participation.  Women in the NAACP also helped to organize fundraisers and other events to help fund their causes and struggle.

'''The Offences Against the Person Act 1837''' (7 Will.4 &amp; 1 Vict. c.85) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. It reformed the law relating to [[offences against the person]].

It repealed a number of offences under the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]] and the corresponding Irish Act (10 Geo.4 c.34) and re-enacted them in different terms.

Section 4 replaced section 12 of the 1828 Act and abolished the death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent. 

Section 6 replaced section 13 of the 1828 Act and abolished the death penalty for post-[[quickening]] abortions. Unlike the previous Act, this provision made no distinction between pre- and post- quickening abortions.

The Act has been wholly replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

'''Opower''' was a company that provided a software-as-a-service customer engagement platform for utilities. It existed as an independent corporation until its acquisition by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2016. The Opower product line are now marketed by Oracle under the Oracle Utilities moniker.

== History and growth ==
Founded in 2007 by long-time friends Dan Yates and [[Alex Laskey]], Opower is headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia. As of February 2014, it employed more than 500 people in five offices: Arlington, San Francisco, London, Singapore, and Japan.

In June 2010, [[iLike]] founder [[Hadi Partovi]] joined Opower's board to advise on its [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/opower-growth/ "Opower to Expand to West Coast, Names iLike Founder Hadi Partovi to Advisory Board,"] TechCrunch, June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Opower opened a second office in [[San Francisco]] and had Fred Butler, a former president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and commissioner of the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]], join its advisory board.

In 2013, Opower added former utility CEOs John Rowe and Dick Kelly, and former White House Director, Carol Browner, to its advisory board. Tom Brady, former chairman of BGE, was named chairman of the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elp.com/articles/2013/06/former-ceos-of-xcel--exelon-join-opower.html "Former CEOs of Xcel, Exelon Join Opower], ''Electric Light &amp; Power'', June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Opower added Marcus Ryu, CEO of Guidewire, and Deep Nishar, SVP of Products and User Experience at LinkedIn, to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allthingsd.com/20130916/opower-adds-guidewires-marcus-ryu-and-linkedins-deep-nishar-to-board/ "Opower adds Guidewire's Marcus Ryu and Linkedin's Deep Nishar to board,"]"All Things Digital", September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] announced the company as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/NR_TP2011 Thirty-One Visionary Companies Selected as Technology Pioneers 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the company announced its third round of venture capital funding, a $50 million investment led by [[Accel Partners]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], to accelerate its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113000021.html "Opower plans expansion with $50 million investment,"] ''The Washington Post'', Nov. 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to Opower headquarters in Arlington in 2010, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said the company's growth is "a model of what we want to be seeing all across the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House press release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Opower was named to the Inaugural CNBC Disruptors 50 List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100637276 "CNBC Disruptor 50"] CNBC, May 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Opower was named the #1 fastest-growing tech company in the DC region, and #20 in the US, by Deloitte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/TMT_us_tmt/us_tmt_fast500_rankings_110713.pdf "Technology Fast 500 2013 Ranking"], Deloitte, November 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Dan Yates gave the keynote address at the Cleantech Group's Cleantech Forum in San Francisco in March 2014. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1378&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=p-N2&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=156690981409924149615&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=193&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A156690981409924149615%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1378%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary/"Opower CEO Dan Yates #CFSF14 Keynote - Passion, Science, Incremental Change], Vimeo, March 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower held its [[initial public offering]] on April 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2014/04/04/opower-ipo-opens-up-strong-starts-trading-at-25-per-share/ "Opower IPO: Opens up strong, starts trading at $25 per share"], Gigaom, April 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Opower laid off&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2016/04/11/layoffs-at-arlington-based-opower/;|title=ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. Local News|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7.5 % of its global workforce on April 8, 2016.

On May 2, 2016, Opower announced that it was being acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://opower.com/oracle/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/oracle-agrees-to-buy-arlington-energy-data-firm-opower-for-532-million/2016/05/02/83739416-107f-11e6-93ae-50921721165d_story.html|title=Oracle agrees to buy Arlington energy data firm Opower for $532 million|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/opower/index.html|title=Oracle and Opower|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and technology ==
Opower's software uses statistical [[algorithm]]s to perform [[pattern recognition]] analysis from data in order to derive information for utility customers. Without any devices installed in the home, the platform can perform usage-disaggregation analysis, presenting end users information such as heating or cooling usage apart from overall usage, and thus allowing them to spot additional opportunities to save money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/opower-separates-heat-light-in-home-energy/ "Opower Separates Heat, Light in Home Energy,"] ''Greentech Media'', December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The average customer receiving the Opower platform has cut energy usage by more than 2.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-11-09/energy-use-neighbor-vs-dot-neighbor Energy Use: Neighbor vs. Neighbor]", ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] concluded in a June 2010 ''report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceee.org/pubs/e105.htm "Advanced Metering Initiatives and Residential Feedback Programs: A Meta-Review for Household Electricity-Saving Opportunities,"] American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that customer-feedback programs, like Opower, could boost [[energy security]], help the environment and save consumers money.

Opower's Energy Reports incorporate the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]] techniques of [[Robert Cialdini]], Opower's chief scientist and the author of ''Influence'', a 1984 book on persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/21/21climatewire-finding-the-weapons-of-persuasion-to-save-ene-8137.html?pagewanted=1;title "Finding the 'Weapons' of Persuasion to Save Energy,"] ''New York Times'', June 21, 2010, originally published in ClimateWire&lt;/ref&gt; The reports include targeted tips that seek to motivate customers to lower their energy consumption to the "normal" neighborhood rate. The reports also feature [[Smiley|smiley-face emoticons]] for the most energy-efficient homes, a feature that Opower added after research showed that some consumers who used less energy than average started using more once they knew the norm. The reports also compare energy usage among neighbors with similarly sized houses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-01-homeenergy01_ST_N.htm "Do you use more energy than your neighbors?"] ''USA Today'', 1 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The company mails the reports to consumers, but also offers the information in other formats, including internet portals, [[Text messaging|text messages]], email and in-home energy displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20003852-54.html?tag=mncol;title "Opower looks to add human touch to smart grid,"] CNET, May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Opower's software enables customers to input more information to generate recommendations about specific types of energy use, such as [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/02/opowers-new-marketplace-entices-homeowners-to-become-energy-efficient/ |title= OPOWER’s New Marketplace Entices Homeowners To Become Energy Efficient | work = [[The Daily Energy Report]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President Obama's visit ==
[[Image:OPOWER-Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Barack Obama]] President [[Barack Obama]] visited Opower headquarters in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] on March 5, 2010. He touted the company as an economic "success story" amid a troubled economy and as a "great emblem" for clean energy jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-clean-energy-jobs "Remarks by the president on Clean Energy Jobs,"] White House release, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He made the visit two months after announcing a "$2.3 billion program"&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/08/news/economy/green_manufacturing_jobs/index.htm "Obama unveils $2.3 billion for clean energy jobs,"] ''CNN Money'', January 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of tax credits for "[[green job]]s." "The work you do here...is making homes more energy efficient, it's saving people money, it's generating jobs, and it's putting America on the path to a clean energy future", Obama said at Opower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972936_1973104,00.html?xid=rss-specials "Can Small Lifestyle Changes Lead to Huge CO2 Cuts?,"] Time, March 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House released a video of Obama's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9AkF3IYko "Creating New Jobs in a Clean Energy Economy,"] White House YouTube channel, March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Peshotanu''', meaning ''one who pays with his body'', according to [[Avesta]]n terminology, is a person who had either been condemned to or previously subjected to two hundred stripes with the ''Aspahe-astra'' and the ''Sraosho-karana''. Two hundred flogs with a whip was a [[capital punishment]] in Ancient Persia next only to death. A Peshotanu was also designated '''margarzan''' or  "worthy of death".

A '''physical law''' or a '''law of [[physics]]''' is a statement "[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]]. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.

The distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use "physical law" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists. See Norman Swartz, ''The Concept of Physical Law'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1985. Second edition available online [https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Several general properties of physical laws have been identified. Physical laws are:

* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.&lt;!--concept pre-existing in article--&gt;
* Universal. They appear to apply everywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=The mind of God : the scientific basis for a rational world|date=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-79718-8|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Simple. They are typically expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation.
* Absolute. Nothing in the universe appears to affect them.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Stable. Unchanged since first discovered (although they may have been shown to be approximations of more accurate laws—see "[[Physical law#Laws as approximations|Laws as approximations]]" below),
* Omnipotent. Everything in the universe apparently must comply with them (according to observations).&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|83}}
* Generally [[Conservation law (physics)|conservative]] of quantity.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=The character of physical law|date=1994|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-60127-2|edition=Modern Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}}
* Often expressions of existing homogeneities ([[symmetries]]) of [[space]] and time.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;
* Typically theoretically reversible in time (if non-[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]), although [[arrow of time|time itself is irreversible]].&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;

== Examples ==
{{main|List of laws in science}}
{{See also|Scientific laws named after people}}

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in [[Isaac Newton]]'s theories of (now) [[classical mechanics]], presented in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', and in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Other examples of laws of nature include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]], the four laws of [[thermodynamics]], etc.

==Laws as definitions==
Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}, or the [[uncertainty principle]], or the [[principle of least action]], or [[causality]]). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)

== Laws being consequences of mathematical symmetries==
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}
Other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (say, [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[space–time]]). Laws are constantly being checked experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed.

Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies can be said to generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations (see below), to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].

The [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws as approximations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical law]] --&gt;
Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

== History ==
Compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature fill the role played by [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.

The observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena—to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.&lt;blockquote&gt;The formula "law of nature" first appears as "a live metaphor" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,&lt;ref&gt;in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, "When Nature Got its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley, "When Nature Got Its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[René Descartes]] described "nature" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts "are to be attributed to nature.

[[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).

== Other fields ==
Some [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius–Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as "laws". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.

Maps between pointed sets &lt;math&gt;(X, x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Y, y_0)&lt;/math&gt; (called '''based maps''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Topology|first=C. R. F.|last=Maunder|publisher=Dover|year=1996|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkyizIcJdK0C&amp;pg=PA31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; '''pointed maps''',&lt;ref name="Rotman2008"/&gt; or '''point-preserving maps'''&lt;ref name="KoslowskiMelton2001"/&gt;) are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that map one basepoint to another, i.e. a map &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = y_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually denoted
: &lt;math&gt;f \colon (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Pointed sets may be regarded as a rather simple [[algebraic structure]]. In the sense of [[universal algebra]], they are structures with a single [[nullary operation]] which picks out the basepoint.&lt;ref name="LaneBirkhoff1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saunders Mac Lane|author2=Garrett Birkhoff|title=Algebra|year= 1999|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-1646-2|page=497|origyear=1988|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., An &lt;math&gt;(X, x_0)&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded as a &lt;math&gt;*=X^0 \to X,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the one-point set. Pointed maps are the [[homomorphism]]s of these algebras.

The [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all pointed sets together with the class of all based maps form a [[category theory|category]].  In this category the pointed [[singleton set]] &lt;math&gt;(\{a\}, a)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal object]],&lt;ref name=Mac26&gt;Mac Lane (1998) p.26&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a [[zero object]].&lt;ref name="Rotman2008"/&gt;{{rp|226}}  There is a [[faithful functor]] from pointed sets to usual sets, but it is not full and these categories are not [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]].&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;J.

The category of pointed sets and based maps is equivalent to but not [[Isomorphism of categories|isomorphic]] with the category of sets and [[partial function]]s.&lt;ref name="KoslowskiMelton2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jürgen Koslowski|editor2=Austin Melton|title=Categorical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4186-3|page=10|author=Lutz Schröder|chapter=Categories: a free tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; One textbook notes that "This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding 'improper', 'infinite' elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology ([[one-point compactification]]) and in [[theoretical computer science]]."&lt;ref name="KoblitzZilber2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neal Koblitz|author2=B.

The category of pointed sets and pointed maps is isomorphic to the [[co-slice category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1} \downarrow \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; is a singleton set.&lt;ref name="joy"/&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name="BorceuxBourn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis Borceux|author2=Dominique Bourn|title=Mal'cev, Protomodular, Homological and Semi-Abelian Categories|year=2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1961-6|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the algebraic characterization, since the unique map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1} \to \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; extends the [[commutative triangle]]s defining arrows of the coslice category to form the [[commutative square]]s defining homomorphisms of the algebras.

The category of pointed sets and pointed maps has both products and co-products, but it is not a [[distributive category]]. It is also an example of a category where &lt;math&gt;0 \times A&lt;/math&gt; is not isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LawvereSchanuel2009"/&gt;

Many algebraic structures are pointed sets in a rather trivial way. For example, [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] are pointed sets by choosing the [[identity element]] as the basepoint, so that [[group homomorphism]]s are point-preserving maps.&lt;ref name="Aluffi2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paolo Aluffi|title=Algebra: Chapter 0|year=2009|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-4781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} This observation can be restated in category theoretic terms as the existence of a [[forgetful functor]] from groups to pointed sets.&lt;ref name="Aluffi2009"/&gt;{{rp|582}}

'''Praxis''' (from {{lang-grc|πρᾶξις|translit=praxis}}) is the process by which a [[theory]], lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, or realized. "Praxis" may also refer to the act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practicing ideas. This has been a recurrent topic in the field of philosophy, discussed in the writings of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[St. Augustine]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Paulo Freire]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and many others. It has meaning in the political, educational, spiritual and medical realms.

{{rquote|right|So, I tried to do a kind of semantic clarification in which ''praxis''—if not on the thither side of this divide—was perhaps somehow between the theoretical and the practical as they are generally understood, and particularly as they are understood in modern philosophy. ''Praxis'' as the manner in which we are engaged in the world and with others has its own insight or understanding prior to any explicit formulation of that understanding...Of course, it must be understood that ''praxis'', as I understand it, is always entwined with communication.|[[Calvin O. Schrag]]&lt;ref name="RamseyMiller2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsey|first1=Ramsey Eric|last2=Miller|first2=David James|title=Experiences between philosophy and communication: engaging the philosophical contributions of Calvin O.

==Origins==
In [[Ancient Greek]] the word ''praxis'' (πρᾶξις) referred to activity engaged in by free people. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] held that there were three basic activities of humans: ''[[theoria]]'' (thinking), ''[[poiesis]]'' (making), and ''praxis'' (doing). Corresponding to these activities were three types of knowledge: [[theoria|theoretical]], the end goal being truth; poietical, the end goal being production; and practical, the end goal being action.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (1999, 2011). ‘What is praxis?’ in the encyclopaedia of informal education. [http://infed.org/mobi/what-is-praxis/. Retrieved: 11/28/2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle further divided the knowledge derived from praxis into [[ethics]], [[economics]], and [[politics]]. He also distinguished between ''eupraxia'' (εὐπραξία, "good praxis")&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Nicomachean Ethics|NE]], VI, 5, 1140b7.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''dyspraxia'' (δυσπραξία, "bad praxis, misfortune").&lt;ref&gt;Krancberg, Sigmund (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cmspK8ine2QC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq= ''A Soviet Postmortem: Philosophical Roots of the "Grand Failure"''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxism==
{{Frankfurt School}}
[[Young Hegelian]] philosopher [[August Cieszkowski]] was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term ''praxis'' as meaning "action oriented towards changing society" in his 1838 work ''Prolegomena zur Historiosophie'' (''Prolegomena to a Historiosophy''). The 19th century [[socialist]] [[Antonio Labriola]] called [[Marxism]] the "philosophy of praxis".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Francese, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DnB4AgAAQBAJ&amp;dq= ''Perspectives on Gramsci: Politics, Culture and Social Theory''], Routledge, 2009, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx alluded to this concept in his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" when he stated that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."&lt;/ref&gt; This description of Marxism would appear again in [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Francese, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DnB4AgAAQBAJ&amp;dq= ''Perspectives on Gramsci: Politics, Culture and Social Theory''], Routledge, 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the writings of the members of the [[Frankfurt School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/horkheimer/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=J.C.|last=Berendzen|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=18 May 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=18 May 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hannah Arendt==
In ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argues that Western philosophy too often has focused on the contemplative life (''vita contemplativa'') and has neglected the active life (''vita activa''). This has led humanity to frequently miss much of the everyday relevance of philosophical ideas to real life.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;Yar, Majid, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/arendt/ "Hannah Arendt (1906—1975)"], ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="women-philosophers.com"&gt;Fry, Karin, [http://www.women-philosophers.com/Arendt.html "Arendt, Hannah"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130209102926/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Arendt.html |date=9 February 2013 }} in Women-philosophers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; For Arendt, praxis is the highest and most important level of the active life.&lt;ref name="women-philosophers.com"/&gt; Thus, she argues that more philosophers need to engage in everyday political action or praxis, which she sees as the true realization of human freedom.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; According to Arendt, our capacity to analyze ideas, wrestle with them, and engage in active praxis is what makes us uniquely human.

In Maurizio Passerin d'Etreves's estimation, "Arendt's [[action theory (philosophy)|theory of action]] and her revival of the ancient notion of [[Praxis intervention|praxis]] represent one of the most original contributions to twentieth century political thought. ... Moreover, by viewing action as a mode of human togetherness, Arendt is able to develop a conception of participatory democracy which stands in direct contrast to the bureaucratized and elitist forms of politics so characteristic of the modern epoch."&lt;ref&gt;d'Entreves, Maurizio Passerin (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/#AreTheAct "Hannah Arendt"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Praxis is used by educators to describe a recurring passage through a cyclical process of experiential [[learning]], such as the cycle described and popularised by [[David A. Kolb]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, D., [http://www.infed.org/biblio/b-explrn.htm "David A. Kolb on experiential learning"], ''Informal Education Encyclopedia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paulo Freire]] defines praxis in ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' as "reflection and action directed at the structures to be transformed."&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970), ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. Bloomsbury Academy, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Through praxis, oppressed people can acquire a critical awareness of their own condition, and, with teacher-students and students-teachers, struggle for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1986), ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Channel 4]] television documentary ''New Order: Play at Home'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/4831/new-orders-naked-80s-art-experiment/|title=New Order's Naked 1984 Art Experiment - MOJO|date=7 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyk5FwrbcgQ|title=New Order Play at Home # 1|first=|last=parkhill62|date=17 April 2007|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]] describes praxis as "doing something, and then only afterwards, finding out why you did it".

Praxis may be described as a form of critical thinking and comprises the combination of reflection and action. Praxis can be viewed as a progression of cognitive and physical actions:

* Taking the action
* Considering the impacts of the action
* Analysing the results of the action by reflecting upon it
* Altering and revising conceptions and planning following reflection
* Implementing these plans in further actions

This creates a cycle which can be viewed in terms of educational settings, learners and educational facilitators.

Scott and Marshall (2009) refer to praxis as "a philosophical term referring to human action on the natural and social world". Furthermore, Gramsci (1999) emphasises the power of praxis in Selections from the Prison Notebooks by stating that "The philosophy of praxis does not tend to leave the simple in their primitive philosophy of common sense but rather to lead them to a higher conception of life".
To reveal the inadequacies of religion, folklore, intellectualism and other such ‘one-sided’ forms of reasoning, Gramsci appeals directly in his later work to Marx's ‘philosophy of praxis’, describing it as a ‘concrete’ mode of reasoning. This principally involves the juxtaposition of a dialectical and scientific audit of reality; against all existing normative, ideological, and therefore counterfeit accounts. Essentially a ‘philosophy’ based on ‘a practise’, Marx's philosophy, is described correspondingly in this manner, as the only ‘philosophy’ that is at the same time a ‘history in action’ or a ‘life’ itself (Gramsci, Hoare and Nowell-Smith, 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;332).

==Spirituality==
{{See also|Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)}}
Praxis is also key in [[meditation]] and [[spirituality]], where emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand experience of concepts and certain areas, such as union with the Divine, which can only be explored through praxis due to the inability of the finite mind (and its tool, language) to comprehend or express the infinite. In an interview for ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|YES! Magazine]]'', [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] explained it this way:

{{quote|Wisdom is always taste—in both Latin and Hebrew, the word for wisdom comes from the word for taste—so it's something to taste, not something to theorize about. "Taste and see that God is good", the [[psalm]] says; and that's wisdom: tasting life. No one can do it for us. The mystical tradition is very much a Sophia tradition. It is about tasting and trusting experience, before institution or dogma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=1323 Holy Impatience: an interview with Matthew Fox], ''YES! Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Strong's Hebrew dictionary, the Hebrew word, ''ta‛am'', is; properly a taste, that is, (figuratively) perception; by implication intelligence; transitively a mandate: advice, behaviour, decree, discretion, judgment, reason, taste, understanding.

==Medicine==
Praxis is the ability to perform voluntary skilled movements. The partial or complete inability to do so in the absence of primary sensory or motor impairments is known as [[apraxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Heilman KM, Watson RT, Gonzalez-Rothi LJ. Praxis. In: Goetz CG. ''Textbook of Clinical Neurology''. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier; 2007: chap. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preventive detention''' is an [[imprisonment]] that is putatively justified for non-[[punishment|punitive]] purposes.

A related, but different form of detention, is detention of suspects or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]. In contrast to preventive detention, detention of suspects must quickly be followed by a criminal charge (or happen after the charge).

In most jurisdictions, people suffering from serious mental illness may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] under mental health legislation. This is undertaken on health grounds or in order to protect the person or others. It does not strictly speaking constitute a form of preventive detention, because the person is detained for treatment and released once this has proven effective.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Australia laws authorize preventive detention in a variety of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203807774|title=Dangerous People|language=en-US|doi=10.4324/9780203807774}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mandatory detention in Australia]] (a form of [[immigration detention]]) is applied to asylum seekers who arrive in Australian territorial waters or territory, until their status as an asylum seeker is established.

In Australia's most populous State, New South Wales, preventive detention regimes have established powers to detain or to continuously monitor and limit particular activities of those who were once convicted of various serious sexual and violent offences. Recently, this has been extended, with the State government now able to control the free movement, speech, association and work of individuals and businesses via Serious Crime Prevention Orders (‘SCPOs’).&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on provisions in the United Kingdom, a range of state officials may apply to the NSW District or Supreme Courts to create an SCPO consisting of any conditions they consider appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) ss 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions may include positive obligations - such as an obligation to report to a police station - or negative ‘prohibitions’ or ‘restrictions’, for instance, a prohibition on travelling beyond a certain location. Failure to comply with the SCPO, carries with it a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) s 8&lt;/ref&gt;

SCPOs have been described as a "watershed extension of state power in New South Wales"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Methven|first=Elyse|last2=Carter|first2=David J.|date=2016|title=Serious Crime Prevention Orders|url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/74815|journal=Current Issues in Criminal Justice|publisher=|volume=28|issue=2|pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; by legal academics, and were strongly opposed by the legal community when they were introduced and passed into with less than two weeks' consideration by the Parliament of NSW.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], anyone declared a [[dangerous offender]] by the courts is subject to an indefinite period of detention

===Costa Rica===
In [[Costa Rica]], the 1998 Criminal Proceedings Code allows for a normal pre-trial "''prisión preventiva''" or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]&lt;ref name=Q2013/&gt; of 12 months if the person is considered a "flight risk", but if the case is declared "complex", it can be increased to up to three years and a half of imprisonment without conviction, or even more in some cases. As of 23 May 2013, over 3,000 people were in pre-trial detention.&lt;ref name=Q2013&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qcostarica.com/in-costa-rica-17-persons-ordered-daily-to-preventive-detention/ |title=In Costa Rica 17 persons ordered daily to preventive detention |date=30 June 2013 |work=QCostarica.com |publisher=Q Media |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The police can detain people for 6 hours without involving the courts or pay compensation for wrongful arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politi.dk/da/loveogrettigheder/politiloven/ The police law {{dk icon}}], Web page of the Danish police&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the ongoing gang war in Copenhagen between the biker gangs and second generation youth gangs it has been suggested to extend the 6 hour limit to several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Nyheder/Koebenhavn/2009/02/22/114719.htm S vil sætte bandekrigen bag tremmer], by Bente Lund, Denmarks Radio, February 22, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] a new set of [[State of emergency|emergency laws]] was introduced allowing the police to detain people for up to 12 hours without charging them for a crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2009/11/26/104519.htm Hårdt politisk opgør før Folketinget sagde ja til lømmelpakken], by Jens Ringberg, Denmarks Radio, November 26, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics fear that they will remain as permanent laws when the summit is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/article833988.ece Lømmelpakken bekymrer dommerne], Politiken, November 13, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--different definition so this is a level 2 heading where above the countries are level 3--&gt;

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], "preventive detention" (German: ''Sicherungsverwahrung'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGBengl_000P66 §66 [[Strafgesetzbuch]]]) has a similar meaning to that in New Zealand. Sicherungsverwahrung can only be imposed as part of a criminal sentence, and it is handed down to individuals who have committed a grave offence and are considered a danger to public safety. It is an indeterminate sentence that follows a regular jail sentence. To assure the suitability of the preventive detention, it has to be reviewed every two years to determine the ongoing threat posed by the individual. Preventive detention is typically served in regular prisons, though separated from regular prisoners and with certain privileges.

The Sicherungsverwahrung is usually imposed in the original verdict, but can be imposed later under certain circumstances. This practice of subsequent incapacitation orders was ruled a violation of Art 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=860012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649l|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a huge discussion in Germany over the handling of this verdict occurred. In reaction to this the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued a verdict on Sicherungsverwahrung in May 2011, deeming it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15046630,00.html|title=German court rules preventive detention unconstitutional - Germany - DW.COM - 04.05.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a new law regulating Sicherungsverwahrung was passed in November 2012
.&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung (BR-Drs. 689/12) {{cite web |url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019193120/http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }} (PDF; 266&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], preventive detention can be extended for up to six months. After three months, such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.

Preventive detention in India dates from British rule in the early 1800s, and continued with such laws as the Defence of India Act 1939 and the Preventive Detention Act 1950.&lt;ref&gt;A. Faizur Rahman, "[http://www.thehindu.com/op/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700101500.htm Preventive detention an anachronism]", ''The Hindu'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial ''[[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]]'' was enacted by Indian parliament during [[Indira Gandhi]] prime ministership in 1971, however it was amended several times during [[Indian Emergency|national emergency]] (1975-1977), leading to human right violations. It was subsequently repealed after Indira Gandhi lost the election in 1977, and the new government took over.&lt;ref name="Saxena2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saxena|first=Priti|title=Preventive Detention and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2k3QCHpcroC&amp;pg=PA99|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7629-992-3|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{See also|Daiyo_kangoku|Public order and internal security in Japan}}
In [[Japan]], pre-trial detention of a suspect can be for up to 23 days without charge. The length of detention, up to the maximum period, is at the discretion of the public prosecutor and subject to the approval of local courts. It can also be further extended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=214811 Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 131 of July 10, 1948, as amended in 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia the [[Internal Security Act 1960]] (ISA) was a preventive detention law that was enacted after Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. The ISA allowed for detention without trial or criminal charges under limited, legally defined circumstances. The ISA was invoked against terrorism activity and against anyone deemed a threat to national security. On 15 September 2011, [[Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak|Najib Razak]], the Prime Minister of Malaysia, said that this legislation would be repealed and replaced by two new laws.&lt;ref name="bernamanajib"&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=613836 Internal Security Act to be abolished, says Najib], 15 September 2011, Bernama.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2012, the [[Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]] (SOSMA) was approved by the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] as a replacement for the ISA. It was given the Royal Assent on 18 June 2012 and gazetted on 22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalgazette.agc.gov.my/outputaktap/20120622_747_BI_Act%20747%20BI.pdf Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Life imprisonment in New Zealand#Preventive detention|Prisoners' rights in New Zealand#Preventive detention}}
In [[New Zealand]], "preventive detention" is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, second only to life imprisonment in terms of seriousness. It may be given to offenders aged 18 or over who are convicted of a qualifying sexual or violent offence, and the court is satisfied that the person is likely to commit another qualifying sexual or violent offence if they were given a determinate sentence of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0009/latest/DLM136454.html|title=Sentencing Act 2002 No 9 (as at 22 December 2016), Public Act 87 Sentence of preventive detention – New Zealand Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preventive detention has a minimum non-parole period of five years in prison, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's history warrants it. A total of 314 people were serving terms of preventive detention in 2013, of whom 34 were on parole.&lt;ref name=Stuff_20130717&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8926501/A-third-of-Kiwi-life-termers-are-out-on-parole |title=A third of Kiwi life termers are out on parole |last=Sharpe |first=Marty |date=17 July 2013 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Thomas Vincent has been in prison on preventive detention since 1968 and was still there as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's longest serving prisoner gets half a century behind bars |first=Deidre |last=Mussen |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/72732437/new-zealands-longest-serving-prisoner-gets-half-a-century-behind-bars |newspaper=Stuff |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Under [[Apartheid]], the government of South Africa used preventive detention laws to target its political opponents. These included, notably, the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act of 1967]], which gave police commanders the power to detain terrorists—or people with information about terrorists—without warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, "[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/1967-terrorism-act-no-83-1967 1967 Terrorism Act, No. 83 of 1967]", ''South African History Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[England and Wales]] used to have provisions, introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in 2003, to deal with [[dangerous offender]]s similar to what is used in Canada. However, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 abolished what was called [[Imprisonment for Public Protection]] (IPP) without replacement, although offences committed prior to the coming into force of the 2012 Act may still trigger IPP.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees the right to "a speedy and public trial". Thus, arrested persons may not be held for extended periods of time without trial. However, since the passage of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] (NDAA), controversy has broken out as to whether or not the U.S. government now has the power to indefinitely detain citizens. Section 1021 and 1022 of the legislation enacted policies described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as allowing indefinite detention "without trial [of] American terrorism suspects arrested on U.S. soil who could then be shipped to Guantánamo Bay".&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, C., "Military given go-ahead to detain US terrorist suspects without trial", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 December 2011: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama].&lt;/ref&gt;

Convicted persons can be held indefinitely as a "[[dangerous offender]]".

{{refimprove|article|date=January 2018}}
'''Property dualism''' describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—[[Materialism|the physical kind]]—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in or [[Supervenience|supervene]] upon certain physical substances (namely [[Human Brain|brains]]). 

[[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Substance dualism]], on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical ([[matter]]) and non-physical ([[mind]] or [[consciousness]]), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which adhere in those respective substances. Substance dualism thus has a much harder time with the [[mind-body problem]]. Both substance and property dualism are opposed to [[reductive physicalism]].

==Emergent materialism==
{{main|Emergent materialism}}

[[Emergentism]] is the idea that increasingly complex structures in the world give rise to the "emergence" of new properties that are something over and above (i.e. cannot be reduced to) their more basic constituents. The concept of [[emergence]] dates back to the late 19th century. [[John Stuart Mill]] notably argued for an emergentist conception of science in his 1843 ''System of Logic''.

Applied to the mind/body relation, [[emergent materialism]] is another way of describing the non-reductive physicalist conception of the mind that asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., organized in the way that living human bodies are organized), [[mental properties]] emerge.

==Non-reductive physicalism==
{{Main|Physicalism#Non-reductive_physicalism|l1=Non-reductive physicalism}}

Non-reductive physicalism is the predominant contemporary form of property dualism according to which mental properties are mapped to [[neurobiological]] properties, but are not [[reduction (philosophy)|reducible]] to them. Non-reductive physicalism asserts that mind is not ontologically reducible to matter, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. It asserts that while mental states are physical in that they are caused by physical states, they are not ontologically reducible to physical states. No mental state is the same one thing as some physical state, nor is any mental state composed merely from physical states and phenomena. 

===Anomalous monism===
{{main|Anomalous monism}}

Most contemporary non-reductive physicalists subscribe to a position called [[anomalous monism]] (or something very similar to it). Unlike epiphenomenalism, which renders mental properties causally redundant, anomalous monists believe that mental properties make a causal difference to the world. The position was originally put forward by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his 1970 paper ''Mental Events'', which stakes an identity claim between mental and physical tokens based on the notion of supervenience.

=== Biological naturalism===
{{main|Biological naturalism}}
[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
Another argument for non-reductive physicalism has been expressed by [[John Searle]], who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are not [[ontology|ontologically]] reducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see [[causality]]). He believes the mental will ultimately be explained through neuroscience. This worldview does not necessarily fall under ''property dualism'', and therefore does not necessarily make him a "property dualist". He has acknowledged that "to many people" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike. But he thinks the comparison is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John (1983) "Why I Am Not a Property Dualist", {{cite web |url=http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210160023/http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |archivedate=2006-12-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epiphenomenalism ==
{{main|Epiphenomenalism}}

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine about mental-physical causal relations which holds that one or more mental states and their properties are the by-products (or [[epiphenomena]]) of the states of a closed physical system, and are not causally reducible to physical states (do not have any influence on physical states). According to this view mental properties are as such real constituents of the world, but they are causally impotent; while physical causes give rise to mental properties like [[wikt:sensation|sensation]]s, [[volition (psychology)|volition]], [[idea]]s, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further - they are causal dead ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harnvb|Churchland|1984|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turner - Rain, Steam and Speed - National Gallery file.jpg|thumb|Huxley explained mental properties as like the steam on a locomotive]]
The position is credited to English biologist [[Thomas Huxley]] (Huxley 1874), who analogised mental properties to the whistle on a steam locomotive. The position found favour amongst scientific [[behaviourists]] over the next few decades, until [[behaviourism]] itself fell to the [[cognitive revolution]] in the 1960s. Recently, epiphenomenalism has gained popularity with those struggling to reconcile non-reductive physicalism and [[mental causation]].
===Epiphenomenal qualia===
In the paper ''Epiphenomenal Qualia'' and later ''What Mary Didn't Know'' [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] made the so-called [[knowledge argument]] against physicalism. The [[thought experiment]] was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:

{{Quotation|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [[neurophysiology]] of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [[central nervous system]] the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [[color television]] monitor? Will she learn anything or not?&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Panpsychist property dualism==
{{Main|Panpsychism}}

Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since
it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules &amp;mdash; as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not strictly a form of property dualism; otherwise it is. 
===Thomas Nagel===
[[Thomas Nagel]] posed the question [[What is it like to be a bat?]] [[Daniel Dennett]], a critic of Nagel's argument, nevertheless called this paper "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness."&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=[[Consciousness Explained]]|date=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441}}

{{Quotation|If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.}}

===David Chalmers===
In more recent work, [[David Chalmers]] has revisited his formerly negative views concerning [[Quantum mind|quantum-theories of consciousness]], and expressed sympathy towards the idea that consciousness be identified with the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]].

===Saul Kripke===
Kripke has a well-known argument for some kind of property dualism. Using the concept of [[rigid designator]]s, he states that if dualism is logically possible, then it is the case.
{{Quotation|Let 'Descartes' be a name, or rigid designator, of a certain person, and let 'B' be a rigid designator of his body. Then if Descartes were indeed identical to B, the supposed identity, being an identity between two rigid designators, would be necessary.}}

The [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) published a special report on '''''Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation''''' ('''''SRREN''''') on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian_srren"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report developed under the leadership of [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] evaluates the global potential for using [[renewable energy]] to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]]. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC’s 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger [[renewable energy policy]] coverage.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

== History ==
Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in its [[fourth assessment report]], published in 2007, but members decided that [[renewable energy commercialization]] merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session28/doc3.pdf  Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the IPCC WG III’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report.  The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/ Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Report "aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&amp;benefits, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.htm IPCC Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main findings==
Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts".&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

In the report, the IPCC said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, United States |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, United States |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18621">'''Scandinavian law''', alternatively known as Nordic Law&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt; is the law of the five [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries, namely [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the [[Europe]]an countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historial development==

Prior to the establishment of [[Scandinavia]]n states in the 9th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as “things”. Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing’s law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and Götaland (13th century, Swedish).&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

The early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus’ Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king’s officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king – [[Olav IV]], the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christain V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christain V’s Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two counties with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. &lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, “the Law of 1734”, declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as “Law of the Realm of Finland”.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Scandinavian law==

In most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. 

While the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, D. and Simonyi, A. (n.d.). Nordic Ways.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition.&lt;ref&gt;Husa, J., Nuotio, K. and Pihlajamäki, H. (2007). Nordic law. Antwerp: Intersentia.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect the ever-changing social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, M. (2018). The Growth of Scandinavian Law. 21st ed. [ebook] Chicago: University of Chicago Law Review. Available at: https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13373&amp;context=journal_articles [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of Law==

Although each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted [[jurisprudence]] that falls neither in the civil law system nor the [[common law]] system.

All five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based upon. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian law===

Norway’s legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including:

1.	Legislation;
2.	Legislative history;
3.	Case law;
4.	Administrative practice;
5.	Customary law;
6.	Legal literature; and
7.	Equity

Due to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Norway adopted its [[Constitution]] in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including:

1.	Legislative power vested in the Storting;
2.	Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and
3.	Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states’ funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Published by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, [[Norges Lover]] Norway’s most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force.&lt;ref&gt;NORGES LOVER. (2018). [S.l.]: VIGMOSTAD &amp; BJORKE.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts,&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code.

===Swedish law===

Swedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. 

Sweden’s Constitution consists of the four “fundamental laws”, consisting of:

1.	The Instrument of Government (1974);
2.	The Act of Succession (1810);
3.	The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and
4.	The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. 

The fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag – the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden’s authorities shall function.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden’s official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

This Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden’s Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish law===

Finnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland’s Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. 

Being a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws. &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;


Finland’s Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danish law===

The Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. 

The legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopted in 1953, the principle aim of Denmark’s Constitution was to abolish monarchy by limiting the King’s power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Icelandic law===

Iceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. 

The most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations’ laws.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Academic views on Scandinavian law==

The Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shrunken head''' is a severed and specially prepared [[human head]] that is used for trophy, ritual, or trade purposes.

[[Headhunting]] has occurred in many regions of the world, but the practice of headshrinking has only been documented in the northwestern region of the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/national-geographic-channel/specials-1/exploration-adventure/ngc-preview-amazon-headshrinkers.html|title=National Geographic: Images of Animals, Nature, and Cultures|work=nationalgeographic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230151722/http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/national-geographic-channel/specials-1/exploration-adventure/ngc-preview-amazon-headshrinkers.html|archivedate=2011-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only tribes known to have shrunken human heads are of the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaroan tribes]]. These include the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], [[Achuar people|Achuar]], [[Huambisa people|Huambisa]] and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]] tribes, found in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Shuar call a shrunken head a ''tsantsa'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Rubenstein]] (2006) Circulation, Accumulation, and the Power of Shuar Shrunken Heads. ''Cultural Anthropology'' vol 22 issue 3 pp. 357-399&lt;/ref&gt; also [[transliterated]] ''tzantza''. Many tribe leaders would show off their heads to scare enemies.

== Process ==
[[File:Shrunken head amazon pitt rivers.JPG|thumb|Shrunken head from the [[Shuar people]], on display in the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], [[Oxford]]]]

The process of creating a shrunken head begins with removing the skull from the neck.  An incision is made on the back of the ear and all the skin and flesh is removed from the cranium. Red seeds are placed underneath the nostrils and the lips are sewn shut. The mouth is held together with three palm pins. [[Fat]] from the flesh of the head is removed. Then a wooden ball is placed under the flesh in order to keep the form. The flesh is then boiled in water that has been saturated with a number of herbs containing [[tannin]]s. The head is then dried with hot rocks and sand, while molding it to retain its human features. The skin is then rubbed down with charcoal ash. Decorative beads may be added to the head.&lt;ref name=Nolan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan, M.D.|first1=Edward J.|title=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|date=1915|isbn=|page=204|edition=Volume 66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-TwAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the head shrinking tradition, it is believed that coating the skin in ash keeps the ''muisak'', or avenging soul, from seeping out.

Shrunken heads are known for their [[prognathism|mandibular prognathism]], facial distortion and shrinkage of the lateral sides of the forehead; these are artifacts of the shrinking process.

Among the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] and [[Achuar people|Achuar]], the reduction of the heads was followed by a series of feasts centered on important rituals.

== Significance ==
[[File:Shrunken Head - Lightner Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Shrunken head exhibited at the [[Lightner Museum]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].]]
The practice of preparing shrunken heads originally had religious significance; shrinking the head of an enemy was believed to harness the spirit of that enemy and compel him to serve the shrinker. It was said to prevent the soul from avenging his death.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;Duncan 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuar believed in the existence of three fundamental spirits:
*'''Wakani''' – innate to humans thus surviving their death.
*'''Arutam''' – literally "vision" or "power", protects humans from a violent death.
*'''Muisak''' – [[vengeful spirit]], which surfaces when a person carrying an arutam spirit is murdered.

To block a Muisak from using its powers, they severed their enemies' heads and shrank them. The process also served as a way of warning their enemies. Despite these precautions, the owner of the trophy did not keep it for long.  Many heads were later used in religious ceremonies and feasts that celebrated the victories of the tribe. Accounts vary as to whether the heads would be discarded or stored.

== Trade ==
When Westerners created an economic demand for shrunken heads there was a sharp increase in the rate of killings in an effort to supply tourists and collectors of ethnographic items.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Ross, Jane. 1984 "Effects of Contact on Revenge Hostilities Among the Achuara Jívaro," in Warfare Culture, and Environment, ed. R.B. Ferguson, Orlando: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Daniel 1999 "Trade Goods and Jívaro Warfare: The Shuar 1850–1956, and the Achuar, 1940-1978," in Ethnohistory 46(4): 745-776.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms [[headhunting]] and headhunting parties come from this practice.

Guns were usually what the Shuar acquired in exchange for their shrunken heads, the rate being one gun per head. But weapons were not the only items [[barter|exchanged]]. Around 1910, shrunken heads were being sold by a curio shop in [[Lima]] for one [[Peruvian libra|Peruvian gold pound]], equal in value to a [[Sovereign (British coin)|British gold sovereign]].&lt;ref name="Eastaugh"&gt;C. J. Eastaugh, ‘Shrunken Head For Sale,’ ''The Times'' (London, 17 July 1952), p. 7. ‘Sales By Auction,’ ''The Times'' (London, 4 Sept. 1951), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the price in Panama's curio shop for shrunken heads had risen to £5.&lt;ref name="Eastaugh" /&gt; By the 1930s, when heads were freely exchanged, a person could buy a shrunken head for about twenty-five U.S. dollars. A stop was put to this when the Peruvian and Ecuadorian governments worked together to outlaw the traffic in heads.

Also encouraged by this trade, people in [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] unconnected to the Jívaros began to make counterfeit ''tsantsas''. They used corpses from morgues, or the heads of [[monkey]]s or [[sloth]]s. Some even used goatskin. Kate Duncan wrote in 2001 that "It has been estimated that about 80 percent of the tsantsas in private and museum hands are fraudulent," including almost all that are female or which include an entire torso rather than just a head.&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt;

[[Thor Heyerdahl]] recounts in ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'' (1947) the various problems of getting into the Jívaro (Shuar) area in Ecuador to get [[balsa wood]] for his expedition raft. Local people would not guide his team into the jungle for fear of being killed and having their heads shrunk. In 1951 and 1952 sales of such items in [[London]] were being advertised in ''[[The Times]]'', one example being priced at $250, a hundredfold appreciation since the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Eastaugh" /&gt;

In 1999, the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] repatriated the authentic shrunken heads in its collection to Ecuador.&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt; Most other countries have also banned the trade. Currently, replica shrunken heads are manufactured as curios for the [[tourism|tourist]] trade. These are made from [[leather]] and animal hides formed to resemble the originals.

'''Statkraft osmotic power prototype''' is the world's first [[osmotic power]] plant, based on the energy of [[osmosis]]. The power plant is run by [[Statkraft]]. The power plant is located at [[Tofte, Norway|Tofte]] in [[Hurum]], [[Norway]], with rooms at the factory area at [[Södra Cell Tofte]] cellulose factory. The power plant uses the osmotic gradient that occurs when fresh water and salt water meet, separated by a permeable membrane. The salt water pulls fresh water through the membrane and the pressure increases on the salt water side; this pressure increase can be used to produce [[electrical power]] with the use of a normal hydroelectric turbine/generator setup. 

The plant is a prototype developed together with [[Sintef]] and began test power production on 24 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10404158-54.html November 24, 2009, cnet.com: Norway opens world's first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2009/11/30/RTV2324909/ 30 November 2009, itnsource.com: NORWAY: World's first osmotic power plant opens in Tofte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece 24.11.2009, Åpnet verdens første saltkraftanlegg. Oslo (ANB-NTB)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015805/http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway]] officially opened the plant. This plant had been planned since the summer of 2008, with a water usage of 10 litres of fresh water and 20 litres of salt water per second. It is expected to give a power output of between 2-4 [[kW]]. With better membranes it is assumed that the power for a similar plant can be increased to about 10&amp;nbsp;kW. A commercial plant is expected to be built between 2012 and 2015.

In 2013, Statkraft announced that is discontinuing its work to develop osmotic power technology. The larger planned pilot facility, and the future commercial plant, will not be built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213005850/http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx |date=2014-02-13 }} Statkraft halts osmotic power investments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
This type of power generation is very reliable, consisting of only slightly more moving parts than a conventional hydroelectric power plant; in this case the addition of a pair of small pumps to move the fresh and salt water to the membrane surfaces. It is very quiet when operating and requires minimal supervision. In addition, it is expected the plant could respond very quickly as an emergency power source, using the membranes to 'store' power ready in the form of high pressure water; this water could be very quickly fed to the hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity. The expected lifetime of this plant is large; with almost no moving parts (those that do move are very simple and reliable), there will be little wear occurring. The availability of spare parts and upgrade components is also good, meaning that an installed osmotic power plant could be run for many years cost-effectively.

==Disadvantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Whilst highly reliable, simple and cheap to run/maintain, this plant is very expensive to install. The permeable membrane is currently an expensive resource, and to have any meaningful output, a very large membrane area is required. The plant described in this article could reach a power output of 4&amp;nbsp;kW in ideal conditions. By comparison, an open cycle gas turbine a fraction of the size (such as the Rolls-Royce or GE aero-derivative gas turbines) could easily produce greater than 15MW for a fraction of the installation costs, although fuel and maintenance costs would be greater. This is an increase in power output 3750 times greater, with a land usage that is much smaller. Comparing the ideal power output of this plant to the rough average household consumption of a modern home detailed in the article [[domestic energy consumption]], it can be seen that this is a very limited technology - working back the figures, it equates that the average home requires 2&amp;nbsp;kW of power. Bear in mind however that advances in materials technology will likely greatly increase the power output per plant volume over time and thus make this a more useful form of power generation, particularly in remote locations where reliability is key and spare parts are difficult to come by (e.g. difficult-to-access coastal locations with a small stream or river nearby that can provide the fresh water required).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">'''Substitution''' is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]].
A '''substitution''' is a [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] transformation on [[formal language|formal]] expressions.
To '''apply''' a substitution to an expression means to consistently replace its variable, or placeholder, symbols by other expressions.
The resulting expression is called a '''substitution instance''', or short '''instance''', of the original expression.
&lt;!--- should be clarified and kept, see talk page: For any [[formal system]] that is ''[[deductive closure|closed]] under substitution'', any substitution of a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] will also produce a tautology.---&gt;

== Propositional logic ==

=== Definition ===
Where ''&amp;psi;'' and ''&amp;phi;'' represent [[Well-formed formula|formula]]s of propositional logic, ''&amp;psi;'' is a '''substitution instance''' of ''&amp;phi;'' [[if and only if]] ''&amp;psi;'' may be obtained from ''&amp;phi;'' by substituting formulas for symbols in ''&amp;phi;'', replacing each occurrence of the same symbol by an occurrence of the same formula. For example:

::(R → S) &amp; (T → S)
is a substitution instance of:
::P &amp; Q

and

::(A ↔ A) ↔ (A ↔ A)
is a substitution instance of:
::(A ↔ A)

In some deduction systems for propositional logic, a new expression (a [[proposition]]) may be entered on a line of a derivation if it is a substitution instance of a previous line of the derivation (Hunter 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;118). This is how new lines are introduced in some [[axiomatic system]]s. In systems that use [[rule of inference|rules of transformation]], a rule may include the use of a ''substitution instance'' for the purpose of introducing certain variables into a derivation.

In [[first-order logic]], every [[Ground expression|closed propositional formula]] that can be [[formal proof|derived]] from an open propositional formula ''a'' by substitution is said to be a substitution instance of ''a''. If ''a'' is a closed propositional formula we count ''a'' itself as its only substitution instance.

=== Tautologies ===
A propositional formula is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] if it is true under every [[valuation (logic)|valuation]] (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]) of its predicate symbols. If Φ is a tautology, and Θ is a substitution instance of Φ, then Θ is again a tautology. This fact implies the soundness of the deduction rule described in the previous section.

== First-order logic ==

In [[first-order logic]], a '''substitution''' is a total mapping  σ: ''V'' → ''T'' from [[term (logic)#Formal definition|variables]] to [[Term (logic)|terms]]; many,&lt;ref name="Duffy.1991"/&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref name="Baader.Snyder.2001"/&gt;{{rp|445}} but not all&lt;ref name="Dershowitz.Jouannaud.1990"&gt;{{cite book | author1=N. Dershowitz |author2= J.-P. Jouannaud | contribution=Rewrite Systems | pages=243&amp;mdash;320 | editor=Jan van Leeuwen | title=Formal Models and Semantics | publisher=Elsevier | series=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science | volume=B | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}} authors additionally require σ(''x'') = ''x'' for all but finitely many variables ''x''. The notation { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;ref group=note&gt;some authors use [ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ] to denote that substitution, e.g. {{cite book| author=M. Wirsing| title=Algebraic Specification| year=1990| volume=B| pages=675–788| publisher=Elsevier| editor=Jan van Leeuwen| series=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science}}, here: p. 682;&lt;/ref&gt;
refers to a substitution mapping each variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to the corresponding term ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''=1,...,''k'', and every other variable to itself; the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be pairwise distinct. '''Applying''' that substitution to a term ''t'' is written in [[postfix notation]] as ''t'' { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; }; it means to (simultaneously) replace every occurrence of each ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''t'' by ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref group=note&gt;From a [[term algebra]] point of view, the set ''T'' of terms is the [[Free object#Definition|free term algebra]] over the set ''V'' of variables, hence for each substitution mapping σ: ''V'' → ''T'' there is a unique [[Universal algebra#Basic constructions|homomorphism]] {{overline|σ}}: ''T'' → ''T'' that agrees with σ on ''V'' ⊆ ''T''; the above-defined application of σ to a term ''t'' is then viewed as applying the function {{overline|σ}} to the argument ''t''.&lt;/ref&gt; The result ''t''σ of applying a substitution σ to a term ''t'' is called an '''instance''' of that term ''t''.
For example, applying the substitution { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''z'' ↦ ''h''(''a'',''y'') } to the term 
:{|
|-
|| ''f''(
| ALIGN=CENTER |''z''
||, ''a'', ''g''(
|| ''x''
|| ), ''y'') &amp;nbsp; 
|| yields 
|-
|| ''f''(
|| ''h''(''a'',''y'')
||, ''a'', ''g''(
|| ''z''
|| ), ''y'')
|| .
|}

The '''domain''' ''dom''(σ) of a substitution σ is commonly defined as the set of variables actually replaced, i.e. ''dom''(σ) = { ''x'' ∈ ''V'' | ''x''σ ≠ ''x'' }.
A substitution is called a '''ground''' substitution if it maps all variables of its domain to [[term (logic)#Ground and linear terms|ground]], i.e. variable-free, terms.
The substitution instance ''t''σ of a ground substitution is a ground term if all of ''t'''s variables are in σ's domain, i.e. if ''vars''(''t'') ⊆ ''dom''(σ).
A substitution σ is called a '''linear''' substitution if ''t''σ is a [[term (logic)#Ground and linear terms|linear]] term for some (and hence every) linear term ''t'' containing precisely the variables of σ's domain, i.e. with ''vars''(''t'') = ''dom''(σ).
A substitution σ is called a '''flat''' substitution if ''x''σ is a variable for every variable ''x''.
A substitution σ is called a '''renaming''' substitution if it is a [[Permutation#Permutations in group theory|permutation]] on the set of all variables. Like every permutation, a renaming substitution σ always has an '''inverse''' substitution σ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, such that ''t''σσ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' = ''t''σ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;σ for every term ''t''. However, it is not possible to define an inverse for an arbitrary substitution.

For example, { ''x'' ↦ 2, ''y'' ↦ 3+4 } is a ground substitution, { ''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4 } is non-ground and non-flat, but linear,
{ ''x'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4 } is non-linear and non-flat, { ''x'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; } is flat, but non-linear, { ''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; } is both linear and flat, but not a renaming, since is maps both ''y'' and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; each of these substitutions has the set {''x'',''y''} as its domain. An example for a renaming substitution is { ''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''y'', ''y'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''x'' }, it has the inverse { ''x'' ↦ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''y'', ''y'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''x'' }. The flat substitution { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''z'' } cannot have an inverse, since e.g. (''x''+''y'') { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''z'' } = ''z''+''z'', and the latter term cannot be transformed back to ''x''+''y'', as the information about the origin a ''z'' stems from is lost. The ground substitution { ''x'' ↦ 2 } cannot have an inverse due to a similar loss of origin information e.g. in (''x''+2) { ''x'' ↦ 2 } = 2+2, even if replacing constants by variables was allowed by some fictitious kind of "generalized substitutions".

Two substitutions are considered '''equal''' if they map each variable to [[Term (logic)#Structural equality|structurally equal]] result terms, formally: σ = τ if ''x''σ = ''x''τ for each variable ''x'' ∈ ''V''.
The '''composition''' of two substitutions σ = { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; } and τ = { ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ u&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; } is obtained by removing from the substitution { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;τ, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;τ,  ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; } those pairs ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for which ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; }.
The composition of σ and τ is denoted by στ. Composition is an associative operation, and is compatible with substitution application, i.e. (ρσ)τ = ρ(στ), and (''t''σ)τ = ''t''(στ), respectively, for every substitutions ρ, σ, τ, and every term ''t''.
The '''identity substitution''', which maps every variable to itself, is the neutral element of substitution composition. A substitution σ is called '''idempotent''' if σσ = σ, and hence ''t''σσ = ''t''σ for every term ''t''. The substitution { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; } is idempotent if and only if none of the variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in any ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Substitution composition is not commutative, that is, στ may be different from τσ, even if σ and τ are idempotent.&lt;ref name="Duffy.1991"&gt;{{cite book| author=David A. Duffy| title=Principles of Automated Theorem Proving| year=1991| publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73-74}}&lt;ref name="Baader.Snyder.2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Franz Baader]], [[Wayne Snyder]]| title=Unification Theory| year=2001| pages=439–526| publisher=Elsevier| editor=[[John Alan Robinson|Alan Robinson]] and [[Andrei Voronkov]] |url=http://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/publications/UnifChapter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|445-446}}

For example, { ''x'' ↦ 2, ''y'' ↦ 3+4 } is equal to { ''y'' ↦ 3+4, ''x'' ↦ 2 }, but different from { ''x'' ↦ 2, ''y'' ↦ 7 }. The substitution { ''x'' ↦ ''y''+''y'' } is idempotent, e.g. ((''x''+''y'') {''x''↦''y''+''y''}) {''x''↦''y''+''y''} = ((''y''+''y'')+''y'') {''x''↦''y''+''y''} = (''y''+''y'')+''y'', while the substitution { ''x'' ↦ ''x''+''y'' } is non-idempotent, e.g. ((''x''+''y'') {''x''↦''x''+''y''}) {''x''↦''x''+''y''} = ((''x''+''y'')+''y'') {''x''↦''x''+''y''} = ((''x''+''y'')+''y'')+''y''. An example for non-commuting substitutions is { ''x'' ↦ ''y'' } { ''y'' ↦ ''z'' } = { ''x'' ↦ ''z'', ''y'' ↦ ''z'' }, but { ''y'' ↦ ''z''} { ''x'' ↦ ''y''} = { ''x'' ↦ ''y'', ''y'' ↦ ''z'' }.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25769">'''Vagal tone''' refers to activity of the [[vagus nerve]], a fundamental component of the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This branch of the nervous system is not under conscious control and is largely responsible for the regulation of several body compartments at rest. Vagal activity results in various effects, including: [[heart rate]] reduction, [[Vasodilation|vasodilation/constriction]] of [[Blood vessel|vessels]], glandular activity in the [[heart]], [[lung]]s, and [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] as well as control of gastrointestinal sensitivity, motility and inﬂammation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this context, tone specifically refers to the continual nature of baseline parasympathetic action that the vagus nerve exerts. While baseline vagal input is constant, the degree of stimulation it exerts is regulated by a balance of inputs from [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Despite the described duality, vagal tone has been reported to mainly reflect the general level of parasympathetic activity.  Vagal tone is typically considered in the context of heart function, but also has utility in assessing emotional regulation and other processes that alter, or are altered by changes and modification of the parasympathetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Fagundes|first2=Christopher P.|last3=Butterworth|first3=Molly R. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2011|title=Attachment Style, Vagal Tone, and Empathy During Mother-Adolescent Interactions |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=22|issue=1|pages=165–184|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00762.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, Wilhelm FH, Spoerle M | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia, cardiac vagal control, and daily activity | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Measuring vagal tone along with its quantification and estimation can be performed by means of either invasive or noninvasive procedures. The former methodologies encompass the vagus nerve stimulation by manual or electrical techniques but literature reports a very limited number of experiments and clinical studies especially involving human subjects. On the other hand, noninvasive techniques are largely employed and they mainly rely on the investigation of [[heart rate]] and [[heart rate variability]].&lt;ref name="Vagus Nerve Stimulation"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howland RH | title = Vagus Nerve Stimulation | journal = Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–73 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24834378 | pmc = 4017164 | doi = 10.1007/s40473-014-0010-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW, Doussard-Roosevelt JA, Maiti AK | title = Vagal tone and the physiological regulation of emotion | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 167–86 | date = 2008 | pmid = 7984159 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01283.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brock C, Jessen N, Brock B, Jakobsen PE, Hansen TK, Rantanen JM, Riahi S, Dimitrova YK, Dons-Jensen A, Aziz Q, Drewes AM, Farmer AD | title = Cardiac vagal tone, a non-invasive measure of parasympathetic tone, is a clinically relevant tool in Type 1 diabetes mellitus | journal = Diabetic Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 1428–1434 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28703868 | doi = 10.1111/dme.13421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noninvasive vagal tone quantification ==
In the majority of cases, vagal tone is not directly measured. The most common procedure towards its quantification consist in investigating the processes altered by the [[vagus nerve]] – specifically heart rate and heart rate variability. As a general consideration, increased vagal tone (and thus vagal action) is associated with a diminished and more variable heart rate. On the opposite, during [[Tilt table test|graded orthostatic tilt]], vagal tone withdrawal is physiological and described as an indirect indicator of cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montano N, Ruscone TG, Porta A, Lombardi F, Pagani M, Malliani A | title = Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability to assess the changes in sympathovagal balance during graded orthostatic tilt | journal = Circulation | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 1826–31 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7923668 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.90.4.1826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vagal innervation of the heart ===
[[Heart rate]] is largely controlled by the heart's internal pacemaker activity. Considering a healthy heart, the main pacemaker is a collection of cells on the border of the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] and [[Venae cavae|vena cava]] called the [[sinoatrial node]]. Heart cells exhibit automaticity which is the ability to generate [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical activity]] independent of external stimulation. As a result, the cells of the node spontaneously generate electrical activity that is subsequently conducted throughout the heart, resulting in a regular heart rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In absence of any external stimuli, sinoatrial pacing contributes to maintain the heart rate in the range of 60–100 beats per minute (bpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunan D, Sandercock GR, Brodie DA | title = A quantitative systematic review of normal values for short-term heart rate variability in healthy adults | journal = Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 1407–17 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20663071 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02841.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system act in a complementary way increasing or slowing the heart rate. In this context, the vagus nerve acts on sinoatrial node slowing its conduction thus actively modulating vagal tone accordingly. This modulation is mediated by the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] and downstream changes to [[Ion channel|ionic currents]] and calcium of heart cells.&lt;ref name="Vagus Nerve Stimulation"/&gt;

Given the evidence that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by modulating the response of [[sinoatrial node]], vagal tone can be quantified by investigating heart rate modulation induced by vagal tone changes. This kind of analysis allows to investigate vagal tone by means of several noninvasive techniques based on [[heart rate variability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Respiratory sinus arrhythmia===
'''Respiratory sinus arrhythmia''' ('''RSA''') is typically a benign, naturally occurring variation in heart rate that occurs during each breathing cycle. Specifically, heart rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berntson GG, Cacioppo JT, Quigley KS | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: autonomic origins, physiological mechanisms, and psychophysiological implications | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–96 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8434081 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1993.tb01731.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSA was firstly recognized by [[Carl Ludwig]] but its genesis and understanding it is still nowadays largely discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation | vauthors = De Burgh Daly M | title=Interactions Between Respiration and Circulation|date=1985 |encyclopedia=Comprehensive Physiology|pages=529–594|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/cphy.cp030216|isbn=9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSA has been observed in humans from the early stages of life through adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hathorn MK | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia in new-born infants | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 385 | pages = 1–12 | date = April 1987 | pmid = 3656159 | pmc = 1192333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, RSA is a mechanism which can be consistently found in several different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers MM, Fifer W, Haiken J, Stark RI | title = Relationships between breathing activity and heart rate in fetal baboons | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 258 | issue = 6 Pt 2 | pages = R1479-85 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2360694 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.1990.258.6.R1479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F, Okada A, Mukai S, Fujinami T | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia. A phenomenon improving pulmonary gas exchange and circulatory efficiency | journal = Circulation | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 842–7 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8772709 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castellini MA, Rea LD, Sanders JL, Castellini JM, Zenteno-Savin T | title = Developmental changes in cardiorespiratory patterns of sleep-associated apnea in northern elephant seals | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 267 | issue = 5 Pt 2 | pages = R1294-301 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7977857 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.1994.267.5.R1294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[inhalation]] [[Thoracic diaphragm|intra-thoracic pressure]] lowers due to the contraction and downward movement of the [[Diaphragmatic breathing|diaphragm]] and the expansion of the chest cavity. Atrial pressure is also lowered as a result, enabling an increased blood flow to the heart. Such increase in blood volume towards the heart cavities triggers [[baroreceptor]]s which act to diminish vagal tone. Subsequently, heart rate increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On the opposite during [[exhalation]], the diaphragm relaxes, moving upward it decreases the size of the chest cavity, causing a subsequent increase in intrathoracic pressure. This increase in pressure inhibits [[Venous return curve|venous return]] to the heart resulting in both reduced atrial expansion and minor activation of baroreceptors. Given the reduced baroreceptor activation, vagal tone is not suppressed as during inhalation so that it can exert its ability in decreasing heart rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== RSA as a vagal tone estimator ====
As previously described, it is nowadays established that the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system influence each other reciprocally and independently so more and more measures able to discriminate the two contributions have been developed. In recent years, several studies have been published highlighting the quantification of RSA as a reliable tool to investigate vagal tone in a noninvasive way. Such investigations encompass physiological, behavioral, and several clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Sakakibara Y, Yamada M, Kamiya T, Fujinami T, Yokoyama K, Watanabe Y, Takata K | title = Diurnal variations in vagal and sympathetic cardiac control | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 258 | issue = 3 Pt 2 | pages = H642-6 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2316678 | doi = 10.1152/ajpheart.1990.258.3.H642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porges|first=Stephen W. | name-list-format = vanc | chapter=Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia: Physiological Basis, Quantitative Methods, and Clinical Implications|date=1986 | title =Cardiorespiratory and Cardiosomatic Psychophysiology|pages=101–115|publisher=Springer US |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0360-3_7|isbn=9781475703627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagani M, Lombardi F, Guzzetti S, Rimoldi O, Furlan R, Pizzinelli P, Sandrone G, Malfatto G, Dell'Orto S, Piccaluga E | title = Power spectral analysis of heart rate and arterial pressure variabilities as a marker of sympatho-vagal interaction in man and conscious dog | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–93 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 2874900 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.59.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage in measuring of vagal tone by RSA is that such information are easily derivable from a single [[electrocardiography]] (ECG) recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, van Beek J, Wientjes C | title = A comparison of three quantification methods for estimation of respiratory sinus arrhythmia | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 702–14 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2100356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, novel methodologies started addressing RSA quantification by a multivariate approach thus not considering ECG only but the interrelationship of ECG and [[Respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick TE, Hsieh YH, Dhingra RR, Baekey DM, Galán RF, Wehrwein E, Morris KF | title = Cardiorespiratory coupling: common rhythms in cardiac, sympathetic, and respiratory activities | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 209 | pages = 191–205 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24746049 | pmc = 4052709 | doi = 10.1016/b978-0-444-63274-6.00010-2 | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 9780444632746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartsch RP, Schumann AY, Kantelhardt JW, Penzel T, Ivanov PC | title = Phase transitions in physiologic coupling | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 26 | pages = 10181–6 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22691492 | pmc = 3387128 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1204568109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite, vagal tone quantification by means of RSA has been questioned by many authors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, Karemaker J, Wieling W | title = Prediction of tonic parasympathetic cardiac control using respiratory sinus arrhythmia: the need for respiratory control | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–16 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 1946886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that RSA is unequivocally related to vagal control but it also clear that is determined by two different mechanisms namely: vagal tonic and vagal phasic. The former processes exhibit different dynamics and origins so that it is crucial to be able to differentiate their contributions to RSA. Furthermore, it has been observed that tonic and phasic components are distinct yet not completely independent one each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the nowadays limitations in RSA quantification, it is considered a promising, noninvasive and reliable index of vagal control of the heart, thus an indirect estimator of vagal tone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Biological findings====
The main hypothesis capable of explaining the reason behind the correlation of RSA and vagal tone describes RSA as an intrinsic resting function of the cardiopulmonary system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F | title = Hypothesis: respiratory sinus arrhythmia is an intrinsic resting function of cardiopulmonary system | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12667941 | doi = 10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00851-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory suggest that in animals and humans RSA may eventually contribute to energy saving for both cardiac and respiratory systems thus reducing the heart rate and related heartbeats numbers. Furthermore, RSA could save energy expenditure by suppressing ineffective ventilation during the ebb of [[perfusion]] (delivery of blood from arteries to capillaries for oxygenation and nutrition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ben-Tal A, Shamailov SS, Paton JF | title = Evaluating the physiological significance of respiratory sinus arrhythmia: looking beyond ventilation-perfusion efficiency | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 590 | issue = 8 | pages = 1989–2008 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22289913 | pmc = 3573317 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2011.222422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F, Okada A, Mukai S, Fujinami T | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia. A phenomenon improving pulmonary gas exchange and circulatory efficiency | journal = Circulation | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 842–7 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8772709 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.94.4.842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the physiological fields, RSA has been found to increase in subjects in resting state and to decrease in state of stress or tension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  RSA is increased in supine position and decreased in prone position. RSA is on average higher and more pronounced during day time with respect to night time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  RSA have also been extensively used to quantify vagal tone withdrawal in [[Tilt table test|graded orthostatic tilt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis GF, Furman SA, McCool MF, Porges SW | title = Statistical strategies to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia: are commonly used metrics equivalent? | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 349–64 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22138367 | pmc = 3269511 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.11.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, expression of RSA decreases with age: it is pronounced in children and its magnitude tends to gradually disappear once a subject approach adulthood.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graziano P, Derefinko K | title = Cardiac vagal control and children's adaptive functioning: a meta-analysis | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–37 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23648264 | pmc = 4074920 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adults in excellent cardiovascular health, such as endurance runners, swimmers, and cyclists, are likely to have a more pronounced RSA. Professional athletes on average maintain very high vagal tone and consequently higher RSA levels. RSA has been found to becomes less prominent in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masi CM, Hawkley LC, Rickett EM, Cacioppo JT | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and diseases of aging: obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–23 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17034928 | pmc = 1804292 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological findings====
The majority of vagal tone research in the physiological field (social behavior, social interactions, and human psychology) have been focused on [[newborn]]s and [[child]]ren.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The rational is to investigate children's adaptive functioning within a quantitative and reliable framework. Typically, researchers focus their attention on baseline vagal tone detection, treating it either as a potential predictor of behavior or examining its relationship with mental health (particularly [[emotion regulation]], [[anxiety]], and [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing]] and [[externalizing disorders]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell AM, Hughes-Scalise A, Klostermann S, Azem T | title = Maternal depression and the heart of parenting: respiratory sinus arrhythmia and affective dynamics during parent-adolescent interactions | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 653–62 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21875198 | doi = 10.1037/a0025225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polyvagal theory]] by [[Stephen Porges|Porges]] is considered as the most influential model able to describe the differences between basal vagal tone during steady state and vagal reactivity as a response to external stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = Orienting in a defensive world: mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage. A Polyvagal Theory | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–18 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7652107 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1995.tb01213.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = The Polyvagal Theory: phylogenetic contributions to social behavior | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 503–13 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12954445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = Social engagement and attachment: a phylogenetic perspective | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1008 | pages = 31–47 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14998870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model describes vagal tone modifications a differential measure between vagal tone baseline and vagal tone activation during attention-demanding state. The theory states that successful vagal regulation is characterized by RSA suppression or withdrawal during attention tasks leading to increased metabolic output associated with heart rate increase.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Despite the hypothesized link between vagal tone reduction and social functioning as stated by Porges' theory, researchers have been focusing mainly on the analysis of basal vagal tone. Examples are the findings reporting lower baseline RSA in children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorders]] with respect to healthy controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patriquin MA, Scarpa A, Friedman BH, Porges SW | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: a marker for positive social functioning and receptive language skills in children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–12 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22212893 | doi = 10.1002/dev.21002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that children with more secure attachments with their mothers exhibited greater empathetic responsiveness, less social inhibition, and higher vagal tone, highlighting the vagus nerve's regulatory effect, as well as the quantification of vagal tone by means of RSA, as a predictor of emotional and social function.&lt;ref name="vagal tone adolescents attachment style"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Diamond LM, Fagundes CP, Butterworth MR|year=2012|title=Attachment style, vagal tone, and empathy during mother–adolescent interactions|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=22|issue=1|pages=165–184|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00762.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional heart rate variability parameters ===
Vagal tone estimation based on heart rate is quantifiable by several parameters rather than the use of RSA only. Examples are indexes of beat-to-beat variability such as RMSSD reported by The Task Force of the [[European Society of Cardiology]] and [[Heart Rhythm Society]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Heart rate variability. Standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use. Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–81 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 8737210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart rate variability|Frequency analysis of heart rate]] in the range 0.15–0.4&amp;nbsp;Hz has been reported to quantify vagal tone based on heart rate variability spectrum.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the specific context of vagal tone response to head up tilt, a measure of beat-to-beat variability (RMSSD) showed significant decreases following head-up tilts as reported by Myers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers MM, Elliott AJ, Odendaal HJ, Burd L, Angal J, Groenewald C, Nugent JD, Yang JS, Isler JR, Dukes KA, Robinson F, Fifer WP | title = Cardiorespiratory physiology in the safe passage study: protocol, methods and normative values in unexposed infants | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 106 | issue = 8 | pages = 1260–1272 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28419567 | pmc = 5530586 | doi = 10.1111/apa.13873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method employed to quantify vagal activity is the computation of high frequency spectral component of heart rate variability power spectral density.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; An example for the latter described methodology is the change in sympatho-vagal balance during [[hypnosis]]. Results report hypnosis to affect heart rate variability, shifting the sympatho-vagal interaction toward an enhanced parasympathetic activity and reduction of the sympathetic tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeBenedittis|first=G.|last2=Cigada|first2=M.|last3=Bianchi|first3=A.|last4=Signorini|first4=M.

The '''World Geodetic System''' ('''WGS''') is a standard  for use in [[cartography]], [[geodesy]], and [[satellite navigation]] including [[GPS]]. It comprises a standard [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinate system]] for the [[Earth]], a standard [[spheroid]]al reference surface (the ''datum'' or ''[[reference ellipsoid]]'') for raw [[altitude]] data, and a [[gravitation]]al [[equipotential surface]] (the ''[[geoid]]'') that defines the ''nominal sea level''.

The latest revision is '''WGS&amp;nbsp;84''' (also known as  '''WGS&amp;nbsp;1984''', '''EPSG:4326'''), established in 1984 and last revised in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |title=World Geodetic System  website of the NGA ''(archived April 2012)'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402143802/https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier schemes included '''WGS&amp;nbsp;72''', '''WGS&amp;nbsp;66''', and '''WGS&amp;nbsp;60'''.  WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is the reference coordinate system used by the [[Global Positioning System]].

==Main parameters==
The coordinate origin of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is meant to be located at the Earth's [[center of mass]]; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cddis.nasa.gov/926/egm96/doc/S11.HTML | publisher = [[NASA]] | title = The EGM96 Geoid Undulation with Respect to the WGS84 Ellipsoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 meridian of zero longitude is the [[IERS Reference Meridian]],&lt;ref name = "Manual"&gt;[[EUROCONTROL|European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation]] and [[Institute of Geodesy and Navigation|IfEN]]: WGS&amp;nbsp;84 Implementation Manual, p. 13. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 5.3 [[Minute of arc|arc seconds]] or {{convert|102|m|ft|}} east of the [[Greenwich meridian]] at the latitude of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/greenwich.htm |title=Greenwich Meridan, Tracing its History |website=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malys et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Why the Greenwich meridian moved | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Malys | first2 = John H. | last2 = Seago | first3 = Nikolaos K. | last3 = Palvis | first4 = P.

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 datum surface is an [[oblate spheroid]] with equatorial radius ''a'' = {{gaps|6|378|137}}&amp;nbsp;m at the [[equator]] and [[flattening]] ''f'' = 1/{{gaps|298.257|223|563}}.&lt;ref name="Third Edition 2000"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report TR 8350.2 Third Edition, Amendment 1, 1 Jan 2000, "Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984"&lt;/ref&gt; The polar semi-minor axis ''b'' then equals ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f'')&amp;nbsp;= {{gaps|6|356|752.3142}}&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Third Edition 2000"/&gt;

Currently, WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 ([[EGM96]]) geoid, revised in 2004.  This geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a [[spherical harmonics]] series of degree 360 (which provides about 100&amp;nbsp;km latitudinal resolution near the Equator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html |title=NGA: NGA/NASA EGM96, N=M=360 Earth Gravitational Model |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 reference ellipsoid range from about −105&amp;nbsp;m to about +85&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923013646/http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  EGM96 differs from the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84 geoid, referred to as EGM84.

==History==
Efforts to supplement the various national [[surveying]] systems began in the 19th century with [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|F.R. Helmert's]] famous book {{lang|de|Mathematische und Physikalische Theorien der Physikalischen Geodäsie}} (''Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy''). [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] founded the ''Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung'' (Central Bureau of International [[Geodesy]]), and a series of global [[ellipsoid]]s of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, [[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]] 1910/ 1924).

A unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:
* International [[space science]] and the beginning of [[astronautics]].
* The lack of inter-continental geodetic information.
* The inability of the large [[geodetic system]]s, such as European Datum ([[ED50]]), [[North American Datum]] (NAD), and [[Tokyo Datum]] (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis
* Need for global maps for [[navigation]], aviation, and [[geography]].
* Western [[Cold War]] preparedness necessitated a standardised, [[NATO]]-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO [[STANAG|Standardisation Agreement]]

In the late 1950s, the [[United States Department of Defense]], together with [[scientist]]s of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS&amp;nbsp;60). The term ''datum'' as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of [[latitude]]s, [[longitude]]s, and [[elevation]]s. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the [[spirit level]], [[plumb-bob|plumb line]], or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see [[physical geodesy]]). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the [[geoid]], a surface that is not readily found using [[satellite geodesy]]. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping.  Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the [[geoid]].

In accomplishing WGS&amp;nbsp;60, a combination of available surface [[gravity]] data, [[astro-geodetic]] data and results from  HIRAN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ak7.html |title=NOAA History - Stories and Tales of the Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey - Personal Tales/Earth Measurer/Aslakson Bio |website=History.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canadian [[SHORAN]] surveys  were used to define a best-fitting [[ellipsoid]] and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.)  The sole contribution of [[satellite]] data to the development of WGS&amp;nbsp;60 was a value for the [[ellipsoid]] flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.

[[Image:GRAVIMETRIC DATUM ORIENTATION.SVG|thumb|225px|Gravimetric datum orientation]]

Prior to WGS&amp;nbsp;60, the U.S. Army and [[U.S. Air Force]] had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method.  To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic [[vertical deflection|deflections]] and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and [[gravimetric]] [[geoid]]s. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS&amp;nbsp;60.

==The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1966==
Improvements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of [[Irene Fischer]] and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy [[map]]ping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface [[gravity]] observations, results from the extension of [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] networks, and large amounts of [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and [[optical]] satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6,378,145 meters determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° &amp;times; 5° mean free air [[gravity anomaly]] field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.

== {{anchor|WGS72}} The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 ==
After an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale [[least squares]] adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.

The largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] was also used which included camera ([[Schmidt camera#Baker–Nunn|Baker–Nunn]]) and some laser ranging.

[[Image:WORLDWIDE GEOMETRIC SATELLITE TRIANGULATION NETWORK, BC-4 CAMERAS.GIF|thumb|225px|Worldwide geometric satellite triangulation network, BC-4 cameras]]

The surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° &amp;times; 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.

The astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.

The Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.

The value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the Committee, an a-value of 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.

In the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.

In the early 1980s the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community and also within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. [[GRS 80]] parameters together with available Doppler, satellite laser ranging and Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([[VLBI]]) observations constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced [[least squares]] method called collocation which allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, i.e. geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, dynamic Doppler, etc.

The new World Geodetic System was called WGS&amp;nbsp;84. It is the reference system used by the [[Global Positioning System]]. It is geocentric and globally consistent within ±1&amp;nbsp;m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS) maintained by the [[IERS]] are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS&amp;nbsp;84.

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 originally used the GRS&amp;nbsp;80 [[reference ellipsoid]], but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication. Most of these refinements are important for high-precision [[Earth orbit|orbital]] calculations for satellites but have little practical effect on typical topographical uses. The following table lists the primary ellipsoid parameters.

The very small difference in the flattening thus results in a tiny difference of 0.105&amp;nbsp;mm in the semi polar axis.

===Longitudes on WGS&amp;nbsp;84===
WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the [[IERS Reference Meridian]] as defined by the [[International Time Bureau|Bureau International de l'Heure]],&lt;ref name = "Manual" /&gt; which was defined by compilation of star observations in different countries.

The longitude positions on WGS&amp;nbsp;84 agree with those on the older [[North American Datum|North American Datum 1927]] at roughly [[85th meridian west|85° longitude west]], in the east-central United States.

===Updates and new standards===
The latest major revision of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is also referred to as "[[EGM96|Earth Gravitational Model 1996]]" ([[EGM96]]), first published in 1996, with revisions as recent as 2004. This model has the same reference ellipsoid as WGS&amp;nbsp;84, but has a higher-fidelity geoid (roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km resolution versus 200&amp;nbsp;km for the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84).

Many of the original authors of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 contributed to a new higher-fidelity model, called [[EGM2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html |title=Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new model will have a geoid with accuracy approaching 10&amp;nbsp;cm, requiring over 4.6 million terms in the spherical expansion (versus 130,317 in EGM96 and 32,757 in WGS&amp;nbsp;84).
