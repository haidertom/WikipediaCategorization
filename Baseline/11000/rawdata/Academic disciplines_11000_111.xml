'''3Dconnexion''' manufactures a line of [[human interface devices]] for manipulating and navigating computer-generated [[3D computer graphics|3D]] imagery. These devices are often referred to as [[3D motion controller]]s, 3D navigation devices, [[6DOF]] devices (six degrees of freedom) or a 3D mouse.

Commonly utilized in [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications, [[3D modeling]], [[animation]], 3D visualization and [[product visualization]], users can manipulate the controller's pressure-sensitive handle (historically referred to as either a cap, ball, mouse or knob) to fly through 3D environments or manipulate 3D models within an application. The appeal of these devices over a mouse and keyboard is the ability to pan, zoom and rotate 3D imagery simultaneously, without stopping to change directions using keyboard shortcuts or a software interface. 3Dconnexion devices are compatible with over 100 applications including [[Autodesk Inventor]], [[Solid Edge]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Google Earth]], [[Second Life]], [[NASA World Wind]], [[Virtual Earth|Virtual Earth 3D]], [[Geomagic]], [[Google SketchUp 6]],  [[Cinema4D]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[SolidWorks]], [[T-FLEX CAD]], [[Photoshop]], and more &lt;ref&gt;http://www.3dconnexion.com/supported-software/software0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

3Dconnexion was formed in September 2001 by [[Logitech]], combining LogiCAD3D, based in Europe, and [[Labtec]]’s [[SpaceOrb 360|3D peripheral business]], based in the United States. The two companies combined  have over 20 years of experience in 3D input devices. LogiCAD3D's product, the Magellan controller, was used in fields such as automotive design and aerospace. A [[NASA]] project used a Magellan product to control a robot in space. The SpaceBall also had a history in space, having been used to remotely drive the [[Mars Pathfinder#Rover operations|Sojourner]] robot on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/press/press-releases/1378|title=Establishment of a New Company: 3Dconnexion|website=www.logitech.com|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[structural semantics]], the '''actantial model''', also called the '''actantial narrative schema''', is a tool used to analyze the [[Action (fiction)|action]] that takes place in a [[storytelling|story]], whether real or fictional.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Tools'', Ch.5, ''Origins and function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbertActantial"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Actantial''&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in 1966 by [[semiotician]] [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] [1966] ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greimas (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The model considers an action as divided into six facets, called [[actant]]s.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"/&gt; Those actants are a combined framework inspired mainly between [[Vladimir Propp]]'s and [[Étienne Souriau]]'s actantial theories.&lt;ref&gt;Venancio, Rafael Duarte Oliveira, Narrative between Action and Transformation: A. J. Greimas' Narratological Models (December 3, 2016). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2879907&lt;/ref&gt;

Greimas took the term ''actant'' from linguist [[Lucien Tesnière]], which coined in his discussion of the grammar of [[noun phrases]].&lt;ref&gt;David Herman, Manfred Jahn, Marie-Laure Ryan (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive tile refresh''' is a [[computer graphics]] technique for [[side-scrolling video game]]s. It was most famously used by [[id Software]]'s [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] in games such as ''[[Commander Keen]]'' to compensate for the poor graphics performance of PCs in the early 1990s. Its principal innovation is a novel use of several [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] hardware features to perform the scrolling in hardware. The technique is named for its other aspect, the tracking of moved graphical elements in order to minimize the amount of redrawing required in every frame. Together, the combination saves the processing time that would be otherwise required for redrawing the entire screen.&lt;ref name="Masters of Doom"/&gt;{{rp|50}} Carmack designed the software engine based on a scrolling display for large images from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="CK-IEEE"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Video Game Software Wizardry of Id | date=August 1, 2002 | first=David | last=Kushner | publisher=IEEE Spectrum | url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gaming/the-video-game-software-wizardry-of-id | accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] (the previous generation of PC graphics hardware) lacks features for scrolling in hardware, scrolling previously had to be done in software, by redrawing the entire screen for every frame – a task that PCs of the time lack the performance to carry out. Adaptive tile refresh minimizes the computing power required for sidescrolling games to within the reach of available hardware. This works by flagging bitmap tiles and redrawing only the graphics on the screen that actually update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aycock |first1=John |title=Retrogame Archeology: Exploring Old Computer Games |url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=NasqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Keen+dreams%22+%22graphics%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DlYIHsYXT_&amp;sig=gCkdPOmvvGz0-VVK9zU6tC3QAEE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirl5qIpd7XAhUSyKQKHUEGC344HhDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keen%20dreams%22%20%22graphics%22&amp;f=false |language=English |publisher=Springer |publication-date=May 9, 2016 |page=45 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30004-7 |isbn=978-3-319-30004-7 |access-date=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Adaptive tile refresh using hardware scrolling made its first appearance in an unreleased test game dubbed ''Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement''. The title of "[[Dangerous Dave]]" had been previously used by [[John Romero]] while programming games for [[Softdisk]]. The new game is a recreation of the first level of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', intended as a realistic test bed for the adaptive tile refresh concept, and was developed within a week. The team of future id Software employees, still working for Softdisk, then recreated the entire ''[[Mario]]'' game, hoping that Nintendo would license the game for the PC. Nintendo declined the offer to release the game after id Software finished it.&lt;ref name="SMB3 demo at IFD"&gt;{{cite av media | title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Demo (1990) | date=1990 | publisher=John Romero | url=https://vimeo.com/148909578 | accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMB3 demo at Ars"&gt;{{cite web | title=Here’s what id Software’s PC port of Mario 3 could have looked like | date=December 14, 2015 | first=Kyle | last=Orland | publisher=Ars Technica | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/heres-what-id-softwares-pc-port-of-mario-3-could-have-looked-like/ | accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters of Doom"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Masters of Doom: how two guys created an empire and transformed pop culture | first = David | last = Kushner | publisher = Random House, Inc | location=New York, NY | year = 2004 | origyear=2003 | oclc=50129329 | isbn=9780375505249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first market appearance of Carmack's adaptive tile refresh came in id Software's first installment of the ''Commander Keen'' game series, ''Marooned on Mars''.

==Technical details==
{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}

EGA has several features that enable the adaptive tile refresh effect:

# The [[Framebuffer|screen buffer]] can be slightly wider than the screen and arbitrarily high, subject to [[video memory]] limitations.
# The position within this buffer from which the screen is drawn can be offset by 1 pixel increments, either horizontally or vertically.
# It has enough video memory to store two such screen buffers, and still have room left over for [[Tile engine|tiles]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].

Carmack used these capabilities to create a buffer that is 64 pixels wider and taller than the screen, leaving room for one extra row and column of tiles in the buffer off the edge of the screen. He used the offset capabilities of the card to let the screen slide through the buffer for smooth scrolling, which partially reveals the extra tiles.

Scrolling is limited to the buffer size, and scrolling further wraps around to show data from the other side of the buffer. So in order to scroll through an entire level, when the scrolling amounts to a whole tile's worth, Carmack's code then draws the next row of tiles from the level into the buffer, just off the edge of the screen, ready to be displayed when the scrolling continues in that direction.

But since only the edges of the screen are being redrawn at any time, sprites in the level do not get redrawn until they reach the edge of the screen. To counteract this, the code calculates which tiles a moving sprite had previously covered and redraws them to erase the old sprite image, then draws the new sprite image in its new position. This allows sprites to be animated independently of the scrolling with minimal computational effort.

Since moving a sprite in this way involves first erasing it and then redrawing it, the image of the erased sprite may be visible briefly, causing flicker. The final part of Carmack's technique is the use of the same EGA hardware features used for scrolling to also implement [[Multiple buffering#Double buffering in computer graphics|double buffering]]: setting up a second buffer into which the code can draw while the first buffer is being shown on screen, which is then switched out during screen refresh. This ensures that no frame is ever displayed mid-drawing, which yields smooth, flicker-free animation.

'''Aerenchyma''' is a spongy tissue that forms spaces or air channels in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. 1967. The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above the water and the submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerenchyma formation and hypoxia ==

When soil is flooded, [[Hypoxia_(environmental)|hypoxia]] develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of [[wetlands]]. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, J. W. H. 1980. Internal winds in water lilies: an adaptation for life in anaerobic sediments. Science 210: 1017–19.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia.  For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, W. H., Jr. and Reddy, C. N. 1978. Chemical changes in rice soils. In Soils and Rice, pp. 361–79. Los Ban˜ os, Philippines: International Rice Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the [[Parenchyma#In plants|parenchyma]].

In general, low oxygen stimulates trees and plants to produce [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;Kozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethylene slows down primary and adventitious root elongation and formation.

== Advantages of aerenchyma ==

The large air-filled cavities provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases between the plant organs above the water and the submerged tissues. This allows plants to grow without incurring the metabolic costs of anaerobic respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, H. E. 1940. Respiration of the rhizomes of Nuphar advenum and other water plants. American Journal of Botany 27: 574–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oxygen transported through the aerenchyma leaks through root pores into the surrounding soil. The resulting small [[rhizosphere]] of oxygenated soil around individual roots support microorganisms that prevent the influx of potentially toxic soil components such as [[sulfide]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]].

The [[American National Standards Institute]]–Nanotechnology Standards Panel (ANSI-NSP) enables stakeholders in [[nanotechnology]] to work together to coordinate the development of voluntary [[Quality standards|standards]]. Such standards include terminology and materials properties and measurement procedures to facilitate commercialization of applications and uses of nanotechnology. ANSI established the panel in August 2004, and membership is open to all parties interested in nanotechnology standards.

==Objectives==
Objectives of the ANSI-NSP include:

*Providing a forum to define needs, determine work plans and establish priorities for updating standards or creating new standards.
*Soliciting participation from sectors that have not traditionally participated in the voluntary standards system.
*Facilitating the development and adoption of standards in the area of nanotechnology in general and nomenclature/terminology specifically.
*Making available the results of the panel’s work.

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''ánthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἄνθρωπος}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''lógos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|λόγος}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augmentées et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382–390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason," in ''Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyck|first1=Thomas William|last2=Stocking|first2=George W.|last3=Goody|first3=Jack|title=After Tylor: British Social Anthropology 1888–1951.|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=102|issue=5|year=1997|pages=1486–1488|issn=0002-8762|doi=10.2307/2171126|jstor=2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=0822386844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D. Levinson |editor2=M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |isbn= |ref=harv |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001162708/http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=2016-10-24|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950–1999 | editor-first=E. L. | editor-last=Cerroni-Long | title=Anthropological Theory in North America |isbn=0897896858| location=Westport | publisher=Berin &amp; Garvey | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor = Schwartz, T. |editor2=G. M. White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.

We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010). ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books. p. xi. {{ISBN|1590561686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |title=Animals &amp; Society Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |archive-date=25 June 2013 |access-date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Note that anthrozoology should not be confused with "[[animal studies]]", which often refers to [[animal testing]].}}

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995). "The Problematics of "Race" in Contemporary Biological Anthropology." In ''Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science''. International Institute for Human Evolutionary Research. {{ISBN|0964424800}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330360604|title=Melanin, afrocentricity, and pseudoscience|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=36|pages=33|year=1993|last1=De Montellano|first1=Bernard R. Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (2007-09-07). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System"]. American Anthropological Association (2009-12-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures—Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6498">The medieval state of '''[[Kievan Rus']]''' incorporated parts of what is now modern [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Belarus]], and was centered on [[Kiev]] and [[Novgorod]]. Its '''architectural style''' quickly established itself after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988 and was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. After the disintegration of [[Kievan Rus']] followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]] in the first half of the 13th century, the architectural tradition continued in the principalities of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Galicia-Volhynia]] and eventually had direct influence on the [[Russian architecture|Russian]], [[Ukrainian architecture|Ukrainian]], and [[Belarusian architecture|Belarusian]] Architecture.

==Church architecture==
[[File:Maket Sofii.JPG|thumb|300px|Before its reconstruction in the 18th century, St. Sofia in Kiev was a prime example and a model for all churches in Kievan Rus]]

The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state which quickly established itself was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like.

The 10th-century [[Church of the Tithes]] in Kiev was the first cult building to be made of stone. The earliest Kievan churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters.

Another great example of an early church of Kievan Rus' was the thirteen-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037–54), built by [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. Much of its exterior has been altered with time, extending ove the area and eventually acquiring 25 domes.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1045-1050), {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on the other hand, expressed a new style that exerted a strong influence on Russian church architecture. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe.

Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117–19), and St George's (1119).

Along with cathedrals, of note was the architecture of monasteries of these times.

The 12th-13th centuries were the period of feudal division of Kievan Rus into princedoms which were in nearly permanent feud, with multipication of cathedrals in emerging princedoms and courts of local princes ''[[knyaz]]es''.

[[File:Bogolyubovo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most famous Russian medieval churches.]]
By the end of the 12th century the divide of the country was final and new centers of power took the Kievan style and adopted it to their traditions. In the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] the local churches were built of white stone with help of Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Suzdal style is also known as "white-stone architecture" ("белокаменное зодчество"). The first white-stone church was the [[St. Boris and Gleb Church]] commissioned by [[Yuri Dolgoruky]], a church-fortress in [[Kideksha]] near Suzdal, at the supposed place of the stay of knyazes Boris and Gleb on their pilgrimage to Kiev. The white-stone churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Rus' architecture. The most important churches in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and [[St Demetrios Cathedral]] (built 1194-97).

In the western splinter of [[Kingdom of Halych-Volhynia]] churches in a traditional Kievan style were built for some time, but eventually the style began to drift towards Central European Romanesque tradition.

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus', particularly the [[Svirskaya Church]] of [[Smolensk]] (1191–94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church (1196–99) in [[Chernigov]] (modern Chernihiv, Ukraine), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

==Secular architecture==
There were very few examples of secular (non-religious) architecture in [[Kievan Rus]]. [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongolian period.

In Kiev, the capital of the country, no secular monuments survived aside from pieces of walls and ruins of gates. The [[Golden Gates of Kiev]] were destroyed completely over the years with only the ruins remaining. In the 20th century a museum was erected above the ruins, it is mirror image of the gates of the Kievan Rus period but is not a monument of the time.

One of the best examples, the fortress of [[Belgorod Kievskiy]], is still lying under the ground waiting major excavation.

In the 1940s, the archaeologist [[Nikolai Voronin]] discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]], dating from 1158-65.

[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Asci of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', [[Phase contrast]] image]]
[[File:Sordaria fimicola asci.jpg|thumb|400px|There are 8 ascospores in each ascus of ''[[Sordaria fimicola]]''.]]

An '''ascus''' (plural '''asci'''; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἀσκός}} ''{{transl|el|ảskós}}'' '[[skin#Animal skin products|skin]] bag'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)sko/s|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ἀσκός|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in [[Ascomycota|ascomycete]] [[fungi]].  Asci usually contain eight [[ascospore]]s, produced by [[meiosis]] followed, in most species, by a [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell division.  However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. ''[[Monosporascus cannonballus]]''), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off [[conidia]] that may fill the asci (e.g. ''[[Tympanis]]'') with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some ''[[Cordyceps]]'', also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a [[septum]]), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term '''ocular chamber''', or '''oculus''',  refers to the epiplasm (the portion of [[cytoplasm]] not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the "bourrelet" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawksworth DL. |title=Ascomycete Systematics: Problems and Perspectives in the Nineties |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3THvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4757-9290-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--cites only previous sentence--&gt;

In many cases the asci are formed in a regular layer, the ''[[hymenium]]'', in a fruiting body which is visible to the naked eye, here called an ''[[ascocarp]]'' or ''ascoma''.  In other cases, such as single-celled [[yeast]]s, no such structures are found. In rare cases asci of some genera can regularly develop inside older discharged asci one after another, e.g. ''[[Dipodascus]]''.

Asci normally release their spores by bursting at the tip, but they may also digest themselves passively releasing the ascospores either in a liquid or as a dry powder.  Discharging asci usually have a specially differentiated tip, either a pore or an operculum. In some hymenium forming genera, when one ascus bursts, it can trigger the bursting of many other asci in the ascocarp resulting in a massive discharge visible as a cloud of spores – the phenomenon called "puffing".  This is an example of [[positive feedback]]. A faint hissing sound can also be heard for species of ''[[Peziza]]'' and other [[cup fungi]].

Asci, notably those of ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', have been used in laboratories for studying the process of meiosis, because the four [[cell (biology)|cell]]s produced by meiosis line up in regular order.  By modifying [[gene]]s coding for spore color and nutritional requirements, the biologist can study [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] and other phenomena.  The formation of asci and their use in genetic analysis are described in detail in ''Neurospora crassa''.

Asci of most [[Pezizomycotina]] develop after the formation of [[crozier (mycology)|croziers]] at their base. The croziers help maintain a brief [[dikaryon]]. The compatible nuclei of the dikaryon merge forming a [[diploid]] nucleus that then undergoes [[meiosis]] and ultimately internal ascospore formation. Members of the [[Taphrinomycotina]] and [[Saccharomycotina]] do not form croziers.

==Classification==
[[File:Hypomyces chrysospermus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Asci of ''[[Hypomyces chrysospermus]]'' (they are unitunicate-inoperculate). [[differential interference contrast microscopy|DIC]] image.]]

The form of the '''ascus''', the capsule which contains the sexual spores, is important for classification of the [[Ascomycota]]. There are four basic types of ascus.
*A '''unitunicate-operculate''' ascus has a "lid", the [[Operculum (botany)|Operculum]], which breaks open when the spores are mature and allows the spores to escape.  Unitunicate-operculate asci only occur in those ascocarps which have apothecia, for instance the [[morel]]s.  'Unitunicate' means 'single-walled'.
*Instead of an operculum, a '''unitunicate-inoperculate''' ascus has an elastic ring that functions like a [[Relief valve|pressure valve]].  Once mature the elastic ring briefly expands and lets the spores shoot out.  This type appears both in [[Apothecium|apothecia]] and in [[Perithecium|perithecia]]; an example is the illustrated ''Hypomyces chrysospermus''.

[[File:ascus.gif|thumb|left|Ascus of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' containing a tetrad of four spores]]

*A '''bitunicate''' ascus is enclosed in a double wall.  This consists of a thin, brittle outer shell and a thick elastic inner wall.  When the spores are mature, the shell splits open so that the inner wall can take up water. As a consequence this begins to extend with its spores until it protrudes above the rest of the ascocarp so that the spores can escape into free air without being obstructed by the bulk of the fruiting body.  Bitunicate asci occur only in [[Pseudothecium|pseudothecia]] and are found only in the classes ''[[Dothideomycetes]]'' and ''[[Chaetothyriomycetes]]'' (which were formerly united in the old class ''Loculoascomycetes'').  Examples: ''Venturia inaequalis'' ([[apple scab]])  and ''Guignardia aesculi'' (Brown Leaf Mold of Horse Chestnut).
*'''Prototunicate''' asci are mostly spherical in shape and have no mechanism for forcible dispersal.  The mature ascus wall dissolves allowing the spores to escape, or it is broken open by other influences, such as animals.  Asci of this type can be found both in [[Perithecium|perithecia]] and in [[Cleistothecium|cleistothecia]], for instance with [[Dutch elm disease]] (''Ophiostoma'').  This is something of a catch-all term for cases which do not fit into the other three ascus types, and they probably belong to several independent groups which evolved separately from unitunicate asci.

The '''Buddhapad Hoard''' or ''Buddam Hoard'' is a large cache of [[Buddhist]] sculptures found near the town of [[Buddam, India|Buddam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], southern India. Since 1905, it has formed an important part of the [[British Museum]]'s South Asian collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=40193&amp;plaA=40193-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 6th-8th centuries AD, the style of craftsmanship fuses the northern influences of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] with the southern traditions of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], which in turn greatly influenced Buddhist art in South East Asia in subsequent centuries.

==Discovery and original ownership==
The hoard was discovered in the late nineteenth century and it was described by the colonial historian [[Robert Sewell (historian)|Robert Sewell]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baptiste|first1=John Guy ; with essays by Pierre|last2=Becker|first2=Lawrence|last3=Bellina|first3=Bérénice|last4=Brown|first4=Robert L.|last5=Carò|first5=Federico|last6=Chirapravati|first6=Pattaratorn|last7=Douglas|first7=Janet G.|last8=Griffiths|first8=Arlo|last9=Indradjaya|first9=Agustijanto|last10=Lien|first10=Le Thi|last11=Manguin|first11=Pierre-Yves|last12=Murphy|first12=Stephen A.|last13=O'Connor|first13=Ariel|last14=Skilling|first14=Peter|last15=Stargardt|first15=Janice|last16=Strahan|first16=Donna|last17=Lwin|first17=U Thein|last18=Wade|first18=Geoff|last19=Kyaing|first19=U Win|last20=Woodward,|first20=Hiram|last21=Zéphir|first21=Thierry|title=Lost kingdoms : Hindu-Buddhist sculpture of early Southeast Asia|date=2014|isbn=1588395243|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1588395243|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artefacts was subsequently donated by the [[Secretary of State for India]] to the [[British Museum]] in 1905. Given the religious nature of the sculptures, the cache may have originally formed part of a ritual deposit from a Buddhist temple or [[monastery]].

==Description==
The 6th-8th century hoard&lt;ref name=book/&gt; is composed of fifteen bronze [[Buddhist]] images, the vast majority of which are either statuettes or parts of small figures. There are three relatively intact standing statuettes of the Buddha (the largest of which is 38&amp;nbsp;cm high), 4 bronze arms, two bases for standing figures (one of which has a [[Brahmi]] inscription), a representation of the god [[Tirthankara]], two small Buddha heads, two fragmentary figures of [[Parsvanatha]] and a bronze model of a [[stupa]].

The term CS has multiple origins, as well as differing concepts.&lt;ref name="Re&amp;Po"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662513497324|title=Citizen science as seen by scientists: Methodological, epistemological and ethical dimensions|author1=H.

The terms ''citizen science'' and ''citizen scientists'' entered the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (''OED'') in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New words list June 2014|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous%20updates/june-2014-update/new-words-list-june-2014|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509083230/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous%20updates/june-2014-update/new-words-list-june-2014|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED&gt;{{cite web|title='Citizen science' added to Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://daily.zooniverse.org/2014/09/16/citizen-science-in-dictionary|publisher=The Daily Zooniverse|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616165001/https://daily.zooniverse.org/2014/09/16/citizen-science-in-dictionary/|archivedate=16 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Citizen science" is defined as "scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions".&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED/&gt; "Citizen scientist" is defined as: (a) "a scientist whose work is characterized by a sense of responsibility to serve the best interests of the wider community (now rare)"; or (b) "a member of the general public who engages in scientific work, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions; an amateur scientist".&lt;ref name=Zoo_OED/&gt; The first use of the term "citizen scientist" can be found in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in an article about [[ufology]] from October 1979.&lt;ref name=Oberg&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Failure of the 'Science' of Ufology|author=James Oberg|journal=New Scientist|date=11 October 1979|volume=84|issue=1176|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muki Haklay cites, from a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled "Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective", an alternate first use of the term "citizen science" by R. Kerson in the magazine ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018170921/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R.

A ''"Green Paper on Citizen Science"'' was published in 2013 by the [[European Commission]]'s Digital Science Unit and Socientize.eu, which included a definition for CS, referring to "the general public engagement in scientific research activities when citizens actively contribute to science either with their intellectual effort or surrounding knowledge or with their tools and resources.

Citizen science may be performed by individuals, teams, or networks of volunteers. Citizen scientists often partner with professional scientists to achieve common goals. Large volunteer networks often allow scientists to accomplish tasks that would be too expensive or time consuming to accomplish through other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvertown|first=Jonathan|title=A new dawn for citizen science|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=24|issue=9|pages=467–471|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definitions===

Other definitions for citizen science have also been proposed. For example, Bruce Lewenstein of [[Cornell University]]'s [[Communication studies|Communication]] and [[Science and technology studies|S&amp;TS]] departments describes 3 possible definitions:&lt;ref name=Lewenstein_2004&gt;{{cite web|title=What does citizen science accomplish?|author=B.

Further, Muki Haklay offers an overview of the typologies of the level of citizen participation in citizen science, which range from "crowdsourcing" (level 1), where the citizen acts as a sensor, to "distributed intelligence" (level 2), where the citizen acts as a basic interpreter, to "participatory science", where citizens contribute to problem definition and data collection (level 3), to "extreme citizen science", which involves collaboration between the citizen and scientists in problem definition, collection and data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Haklay, Muki (2012) in Citizen Science and Volunteered Geographic Information: Overview and Typology of Participation. Crowdsourcing Geographic Knowledge. 2013, pp. 105–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[Mashable]] article defines a citizen scientist as: "Anybody who voluntarily contributes his or her time and resources toward scientific research in partnership with professional scientists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/26/citizen-science/|title=What Is Citizen Science, and How Can You Get Involved?|author=Eric Larson|date=26 May 2014|work=Mashable|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110231048/http://mashable.com/2014/05/26/citizen-science/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Australian Citizen Science Association released their definition which states "Citizen science involves public participation and collaboration in scientific research with the aim to increase scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=ACSA_1&gt;{{cite web| title=What is Citizen Science?| url=https://citizenscience.org.au/who-we-are| publisher=Australian Citizen Science Association| access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACSA_2&gt;{{cite web| title=Discover Another Side of Scientific Research| url=https://citizenscience.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Australian-Citizen-Science-Association-brochure.pdf| publisher=Australian Citizen Science Association| access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the book "Analyzing the Role of Citizen Science in Modern Research" defined citizen science as "work undertaken by civic educators together with citizen communities to advance science, foster a broad scientific mentality, and/or encourage democratic engagement, which allows society to deal rationally with complex modern problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Analyzing the role of citizen science in modern research|author=Ceccaroni, L., &amp; Piera, J.

These projects are generally passive. Computation tasks are performed by volunteers' computers and require little involvement beyond initial setup. There is disagreement as to whether these projects should be classified as citizen science.

The astrophysicist and [[Galaxy Zoo]] co-founder [[Kevin Schawinski]] stated: "We prefer to call this [Galaxy Zoo] citizen science because it's a better description of what you're doing; you're a regular citizen but you're doing science. Crowd sourcing sounds a bit like, well, you're just a member of the crowd and you're not; you're our collaborator.

Compared to SETI@home, "Galaxy Zoo volunteers do real work. They're not just passively running something on their computer and hoping that they'll be the first person to find aliens. They have a stake in science that comes out of it, which means that they are now interested in what we do with it, and what we find."&lt;ref name=AnthonyWilliams/&gt;

Citizen policy may be another result of citizen science initiatives. Bethany Brookshire (pen name SciCurious) writes: "If citizens are going to live with the benefits or potential consequences of science (as the vast majority of them will), it's incredibly important to make sure that they are not only well informed about changes and advances in science and technology, but that they also ... are able to ... influence the science policy decisions that could impact their lives."&lt;ref name=SciCur&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen Science, Citizen Policy|author=SciCurious|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/citizen-science-citizen-policy/|publisher=Scientific American|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423064500/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/citizen-science-citizen-policy/|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits and limitations===

In a research report published by the [[National Park Service]] in 2008, Brett Amy Thelen and Rachel K. Thiet mention the following concerns, previously reported in the literature, about the validity of volunteer-generated data:&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/ParkScience/index.cfm?ArticleID=236&amp;Page=1 |title=Cultivating connection: Incorporating meaningful citizen science into Cape Cod National Seashore's estuarine research and monitoring programs |author1=Thelen, Brett Amy |author2=Thiet, Rachel K. |journal=Park Science |volume=25 |issue=1 |year=2008 |ISSN=1090-9966 |publisher=ParkScience |accessdate=2012-10-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101174310/http://www.nature.nps.gov/ParkScience/index.cfm?ArticleID=236&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some projects may not be suitable for volunteers, for instance, when they use complex research methods or require arduous or repetitive work.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;
* If volunteers lack proper training in research and monitoring protocols, they are at risk of introducing bias into the data.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;
* Members may lie about data. This risk is even greater when bounties are awarded as an incentive to participate.&lt;ref name=Cape_Cod_CS/&gt;

The question of data accuracy, in particular, remains open.&lt;ref name="Frías 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frías |first1=O. |last2=Bautista |first2=L. M. |last3=Dénes |first3=F.

Also, CS projects can influence policy and guide resource management by producing [[dataset]]s that are otherwise infeasible to generate.&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt; In the section "In a Nutshell" (pg3), four condensed conclusions are stated. They are:&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt;

{{quote frame|
# Datasets produced by volunteer CSs can have reliably high quality, on par with those produced by professionals.
# Individual volunteer accuracy varies, depending on task difficulty and volunteer experience. Multiple methods exist for boosting accuracy to required levels for a given project.
# Most types of [[bias]] found in CS datasets are also found in professionally produced datasets and can be accommodated using existing statistical tools.
# Reviewers of CS projects should look for iterated project design, standardization and appropriateness of volunteer protocols and data analyses, capture of [[metadata]], and accuracy assessment.
}}

They conclude that as CS continues to grow and mature, a key metric of project success they expect to see will be a growing awareness of data quality. They also conclude that CS will emerge as a general tool helping "to collect otherwise unobtainable high-quality data in support of policy and resource management, conservation monitoring, and basic science."&lt;ref name=ADQ/&gt;

A study of Canadian lepidoptera datasets published in 2018 compared the use of a professionally curated dataset of butterfly specimen records with four years of data from a CS program, [[eButterfly]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Semeniuk |first1=Ivan |title=The butterfly effect: How Canadians and their smartphones are helping scientists map species diversity |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-the-butterfly-effect-how-canadians-and-their-smartphones-are-helping/ |accessdate=13 October 2018 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=7 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040152/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-the-butterfly-effect-how-canadians-and-their-smartphones-are-helping/ |archivedate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soroye |first1=Peter |last2=Ahmed |first2=Najeeba |last3=Kerr |first3=Jeremy T. |title=Opportunistic citizen science data transform understanding of species distributions, phenology, and diversity gradients for global change research |journal=Global Change Biology |date=3 July 2018 |doi=10.1111/gcb.14358 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.14358 |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eButterfly dataset was used as it was determined to be of high quality because of the expert vetting process used on the site, and there existed a historic dataset covering the same geographic area consisting of specimen data, much of it institutional.  The authors note that, in this case, CS data provides both novel and complementary information to the specimen data. Five new species were reported from the CS data, and geographic distribution information was improved for over 80% of species in the combined dataset when CS data was included. 

====Law====
{{main article|Wyoming Senate Files 12 and 80 2015 'Trespassing To Collect Data'}}
In March 2015, the state of [[Wyoming]] passed new laws (Senate Files 12 and 80) clarifying that trespassing laws applied even if the trespasser's intention was to gather data to further a U.S. government science program.&lt;ref name=CourthouseNewsService&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Gannon|title=Wyoming Criminalizes Citizen Science|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/18/wyoming-criminalizes-citizen-science.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Service|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=29 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050810/http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/05/18/wyoming-criminalizes-citizen-science.htm|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hampered some CS researchers who were collecting data while on other people's land.

{{quote frame|
# Citizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the project.
# Citizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question or informing conservation action, management decisions or environmental policy.
# Both the professional scientists and the citizen scientists benefit from taking part. Benefits may include the publication of research outputs, learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, satisfaction through contributing to scientific evidence e.g. to address local, national and international issues, and through that, the potential to influence policy.
# Citizen scientists may, if they wish, participate in multiple stages of the scientific process. This may include developing the research question, designing the method, gathering and analysing data, and communicating the results.
# Citizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and what the research, policy or societal outcomes are.
# Citizen science is considered a research approach like any other, with limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides opportunity for greater public engagement and democratisation of science.
# Citizen science project data and meta-data are made publicly available and where possible, results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this.
# Citizen scientists are acknowledged in project results and publications.
# Citizen science programmes are evaluated for their scientific output, data quality, participant experience and wider societal or policy impact.
# The leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical issues surrounding copyright, intellectual property, data sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution, and the environmental impact of any activities.

The 7 projects are: Solar Stormwatch, Galaxy Zoo Supernovae, Galaxy Zoo Hubble, Moon Zoo, Old Weather, The Milky Way Project and Planet Hunters.&lt;ref name=Sau&amp;Fran/&gt; Using data from 180 days in 2010, they find a total of 100,386 users participated, contributing 129,540 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref name=Sau&amp;Fran/&gt; Estimating at a rate of $12 an hour (an undergraduate research assistant's basic wage), the total contributions amount to $1,554,474, an average of $222,068 per project.&lt;ref name=Sau&amp;Fran/&gt; It should be noted that the range over the 7 projects was from $22,717 to $654,130.&lt;ref name=Sau&amp;Fran/&gt;

In "Global change and local solutions: Tapping the unrealized potential of citizen science for biodiversity research" by Theobald et al. 2015, the authors surveyed 388 unique biodiversity-based projects.&lt;ref name=Theo&amp;Ett/&gt; Quoting: "We estimate that between 1.36 million and 2.28 million people volunteer annually in the 388 projects we surveyed, though variation is great" and that "the range of in-kind contribution of the volunteerism in our 388 citizen science projects as between $667 million to $2.5 billion annually."&lt;ref name=Theo&amp;Ett/&gt;  

Worldwide participation in citizen science continues to grow. A list of the top five citizen science communities compiled by [[Marc Kuchner]] and Kristen Erickson in July 2018 shows a total of 3.75 million participants, although there is likely substantial overlap between the communities.

Some examples of studies are:

From the Second International Handbook of Science Education, a chapter entitled: "Citizen Science, Ecojustice, and Science Education: Rethinking an Education from Nowhere" by Mueller and Tippins (2011), acknowledges in the abstract that: "There is an emerging emphasis in science education on engaging youth in citizen science." The authors also ask: "whether citizen science goes further with respect to citizen development."&lt;ref name=CS_Eco/&gt; The abstract ends by stating that the "chapter takes account of the ways educators will collaborate with members of the community to effectively guide decisions, which offers promise for sharing a responsibility for democratizing science with others."&lt;ref name=CS_Eco&gt;{{cite book| title=Citizen Science, Ecojustice, and Science Education: Rethinking an Education from Nowhere| author1=M.P.

democratized science and [[K–12|K12]] education." But GRB state: "However, the authors (MTB) fail to adequately address the existing 
barriers and constraints to moving community-based science into the classroom." They end the abstract by arguing: "that the resource constraints of scientists, teachers, and students likely pose problems to moving true democratized science into the classroom."&lt;ref name=DemEdu/&gt;

He continues: "Yet there has been little educational exploration of such projects to date."&lt;ref name=CSLL/&gt; He describes that "there has been limited exploration of the educational backgrounds of adult contributors to citizen science". Edwards explains that CS contributers are referred to as volunteers, citizens or as amateurs. He ends the abstract: "The article will explore the nature and significance of these different characterisations and also suggest possibilities for further research."&lt;ref name=CSLL/&gt;

In the journal Microbiology and Biology Education a study was published by Shah and Martinez (2015) called "Current Approaches in Implementing Citizen Science in the Classroom".&lt;ref name=CurrApp&gt;{{cite journal| title=Current Approaches in Implementing Citizen Science in the Classroom| author1=H.R.

It reports that CS has been used for first year university students as a means to experience research. They continue: "Surveys of more than 1500 students showed that their environmental engagement increased significantly after participating in data collection and data analysis."&lt;ref name=Bene&amp;Chall/&gt; However, only a third of students agreed that data collected by CSs was reliable. A positive outcome of this was that the students were more careful of their own research. The abstract ends: "If true for citizen scientists in general, enabling participants as well as scientists to analyse data could enhance data quality, and so address a key constraint of broad-scale citizen science programs."&lt;ref name=Bene&amp;Chall/&gt;

== History ==

"Citizen science" is a fairly new term but an old practice. Prior to the 20th century, science was often the pursuit of [[gentleman scientist]]s, amateur or self-funded researchers such as Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvertown | first1 = J | year = 2009 | title = A new dawn for citizen science | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 9| pages = 467–471 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-20th century, however, science was dominated by researchers employed by universities and government research laboratories. By the 1970s, this transformation was being called into question. Philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] called for a "democratization of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Feyerabend |author-link=Paul Feyerabend |title=Science in a free society |publisher=[[New Left Books]]|location=London |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-86091-753-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemist [[Erwin Chargaff]] advocated a return to science by nature-loving amateurs in the tradition of [[René Descartes|Descartes]], Newton, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]&amp;mdash;science dominated by "amateurship instead of money-biased technical bureaucrats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Erwin Chargaff |author-link=Erwin Chargaff |title=Heraclitean fire: sketches from a life before nature |publisher=[[Rockefeller University Press]] |location=New York |year=1978 |pages= |isbn=0-87470-029-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2016 indicates that the largest impact of citizen science is in research on biology, conservation and ecology, and is utilized mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data.&lt;ref name=kullberg&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. Kullenberg |author2=D.

===Butterfly counts===
{{main article|Butterfly count}}
Butterfly counts have a long tradition of involving individuals in the study of butterflies' range and their relative abundance. Two long-running programs are the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (started in 1976) and the [[North American Butterfly Association]]'s Butterfly Count Program (started in 1975).&lt;ref name=UKBMS&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)|url=http://www.ukbms.org|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230125155/http://www.ukbms.org/|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NABA_BCD&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie Ries|title=Analyzing the NABA Butterfly Count Data|url=http://www.naba.org/pubs/ab141/ab141count_column.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223114316/http://www.naba.org/pubs/ab141/ab141count_column.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various protocols for monitoring butterflies and different organizations support one or more of transects, counts and/or opportunistic sightings.&lt;ref name=NA_Goal&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 1: Track all North American butterfly monitoring|url=http://www.nab-net.org/goal-1|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230133120/http://www.nab-net.org/goal-1|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eButterfly]] is an example of a program designed to capture any of the three types of counts for observers in North America.

Citizen science projects have become increasingly focused on providing benefits to scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, R. and LaBranche, M. (2004). Citizen Science: Involving the Public in Research. ASTC Dimensions. May/June 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baretto | first1 = C. | last2 = Fastovsky | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheehan | first3 = P. | year = 2003 | title = A Model for Integrating the Public into Scientific Research | url = | journal = [[Journal of Geoscience Education]] | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 71–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, R.E. (2005). Using Citizen Science in Urban Bird Studies. Urban Habitats. 3 (1). p. 70-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] (historically called the Bird Migration and Distribution records) may have been the earliest collective effort of citizens collecting ornithological information in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/|title=North American Phenology Program|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190651/http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, dating back to 1883, was started by Wells Woodbridge Cooke. Cooke established a network of observers around North America to collect bird migration records. The [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]]'s [[Christmas Bird Count]], which began in 1900, is another example of a long-standing tradition of citizen science which has persisted to the present day.  Citizen scientists help gather data that will be analyzed by professional researchers, and can be used to produce bird population and biodiversity indicators.

Raptor migration research relies on the data collected by the [[hawkwatching]] community. This mostly volunteer group counts migrating accipiters, buteos, falcons, harriers, kites, eagles, osprey, vultures and other raptors at hawk sites throughout North America during the spring and fall seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Bird!": An Exploration of Hawkwatching|last=Wargo|first=Brian M.|publisher=BMW Endeavors, LLC|year=2016|isbn=978-1-945226-00-7|location=McKees Rocks|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily data is uploaded to hawkcount.org where it can be viewed by professional scientists and the public.

Such indices can be useful tools to inform management, resource allocation, policy and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Devictor | first1 = V. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = R.

"French citizens monitoring ordinary birds provide tools for conservation and ecological sciences". Acta Oecologica-International Journal of

Similarly, data collected by citizen scientists as part of BirdLife Australia's has been analysed to produce the first-ever Australian Terrestrial Bird Indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian birdlife|url=http://birdlife.org.au/state-of-birds|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizen oceanography ===
The concept of citizen science has been extended to the ocean environment for characterizing ocean dynamics and tracking [[marine debris]]. For example, the mobile app Marine Debris Tracker is a joint partnership of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=MDT&gt;{{cite web| title=Marine Debris Tracker| publisher=Marine Debris Tracker| url=http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu| access-date=19 March 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227041320/http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu/| archivedate=27 December 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term sampling efforts such as the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder|continuous plankton recorder]] has been fitted on ships of opportunity since 1931. Plankton collection by sailors and subsequent genetic analysis was pioneered in 2013 by Indigo V Expeditions as a way to better understand marine microbial structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Common Oceanographer: Crowdsourcing the Collection of Oceanographic Data|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001947|journal = PLoS Biol|date = 2014-09-09|pmc = 4159111|pmid = 25203659|pages = e1001947|volume = 12|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001947|first = Federico M.|last = Lauro|first2 = Svend Jacob|last2 = Senstius|first3 = Jay|last3 = Cullen|first4 = Russell|last4 = Neches|first5 = Rachelle M.|last5 = Jensen|first6 = Mark V.|last6 = Brown|first7 = Aaron E.|last7 = Darling|first8 = Michael|last8 = Givskov|first9 = Diane|last9 = McDougald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizen study of coral reefs ===
Citizen science has recently developed in [[Coral reef]] studies. 

[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting on millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. 
As a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developped, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites (such as [https://www.inaturalist.org/ iNaturalist.org]). Another example, the ''Monitoring through many eyes'' project collates thousands of underwater images of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and provides an interface for elicitation of reef health indicators.&lt;ref name=MTME&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring through many eyes project homepage|url=https://www.virtualreef.org.au|publisher=Queensland Government, Queensland University of Technology, CRCSI|accessdate=10 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301205255/https://www.virtualreef.org.au/|archivedate=1 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] offers opportunities for volunteer participation. By taking measurements in [[United States National Marine Sanctuary|The United States' National Marine Sanctuaries]], citizens are able to contribute data to a variety of [[marine biology]] projects. By enabling these citizens, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] benefited from 137,000 hours of research during 2016.&lt;ref name=MTME_2&gt;{{cite web| title=Volunteers help to ensure national marine sanctuaries remain America's underwater treasures for future generations| url=https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/involved/volunteer_future.html| publisher=National Ocean Servi, NOAA, Department of Commerce| accessdate=5 September 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906034716/https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/involved/volunteer_future.html| archivedate=6 September 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[Réunion island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species&lt;ref name="CBM2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Frédéric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |url=http://application.sb-roscoff.fr/cbm/article.htm?execution=e2s1 |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451 - 460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Art history ===
Citizen science has a long tradition in [[Natural science]]. But nowadays, citizen science projects can also be found in various fields of science like [[Art history]]. For example, the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project AnnoTate is a transcription tool developed to enable volunteers to read and transcribe the personal papers of British-born and émigré artists.&lt;ref name=AnnoTate&gt;{{cite web|title=AnnoTate homepage|url=https://anno.tate.org.uk|publisher=Zooniverse|accessdate=2 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142819/https://anno.tate.org.uk/|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers are drawn from the [[Tate Britain|Tate Archive]]. Another example of citizen science in art history is [[Human-based computation game#Artigo|ARTigo]].&lt;ref name=Artigo&gt;{{cite web|title=ARTigo homepage|url=http://www.artigo.org|publisher=ARTigo|accessdate=2 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601154649/http://www.artigo.org/|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARTigo collects [[Semantics|semantic]] data on artworks from the footprints left by players of games featuring artwork images. From these footprints, ARTigo automatically builds a [[semantic search]] engine for artworks.

===Modern technology===
Newer technologies have increased the options for citizen science.&lt;ref name=BBC_NewEra&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Drollette|title=Citizen science enters a new era|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era?selectorSection=technology|publisher=BBC|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018015022/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era?selectorSection=technology|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen scientists can build and operate their own instruments to gather data for their own experiments or as part of a larger project. Examples include [[amateur radio]], [[amateur astronomy]], Six Sigma Projects, and [[Maker culture|Maker]] activities. Most recently scientist [[Joshua Pearce]] has advocated for the creation of [[open-source hardware]] based scientific equipment that both citizen scientists and professional scientists, which can be replicated by [[digital manufacturing]] techniques such as [[3D printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pearce|first = Joshua M.|date = 2012-09-14|title = Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware|url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303|journal = Science|language = en|volume = 337|issue = 6100|pages = 1303–1304|doi = 10.1126/science.1228183|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 22984059|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310180623/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303|archivedate = 2016-03-10|df = |bibcode = 2012Sci...337.1303P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have shown this approach radically reduces scientific equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pearce|first = J.

Although traditional data collection methods are well-established, citizen science is being used to fill the data gaps on a local level, and is therefore meaningful to individual communities. It has been demonstrated that citizen science is particularly advantageous during a [[flash flood]] because the public are more likely to witness these rarer hydrological events than scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcastle University|title=Communities can fill the gaps on flooding|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2017/04/communityfloodmonitoring/|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051503/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2017/04/communityfloodmonitoring/|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences from Marxism ==

=== Frantz Fanon ===
Frantz Fanon's Marxist writings on [[imperialism]], [[racism]], and decolonizing struggles have influenced post-colonial discussions about the internalization of colonial prejudice. Fanon first tackled the problem of, what he called, the "colonial alienation of the person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Skin,  White Masks|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008|isbn=978 0 7453 2849 2|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mental health issue through [[Psychiatric assessment|psychiatric]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Michael|last2=Walter|first2=Garry|date=2009|title=Frantz Fanon and the confluence of psychiatry, politics, ethics and culture|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/frantz-fanon-and-the-confluence-of-psychiatry-politics-ethics-and-culture/CBD3BF91C1D4CCE616DA14F16D492697|journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica|volume=21|issue=6|pages=308–309|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2009.00428.x|issn=0924-2708|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Les Damnés de la Terre),'' published in 1961, Fanon used psychiatry to analyze how [[French Algeria|French colonization]] and the carnage of the [[Algerian War]] had mentally affected Algerians' [[National identity|self-identity]] and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Vikki|date=2011-01-04|title=Introduction: Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth 50 Years On|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276410383721|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=7–14|doi=10.1177/0263276410383721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that during the period of colonization there was a subtle and constant mental pathology that developed within the colonial psyche.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=250|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanon argued that the colonial psyche is fractured by the lack of mental and material homogeneity as a result of the colonial power's [[Western culture]] being pressured onto the colonized population despite the existing material differences between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=194|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here Fanon expands traditional Marxist understandings of [[historical materialism]] to explore how the dissonance between [[Base and superstructure|material existence and culture]] functions to transform the colonized people through the mold of the Western [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=162|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the native Algerian came to view their own traditional culture and identity through the lens of colonial prejudice. Fanon observed that average Algerians internalized and then openly repeated remarks that were in line with the institutionalized racist culture of the French colonizers; dismissing their own culture as backward due to the internalization of Western colonial ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=161|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fanon this results in a destabilizing existential conflict within the colonized culture:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Western world|the West]], the family circle, the effects of education, and the relatively high [[standard of living]] of the working class provide a more or less efficient protection against the harmful action of these pastimes. But in an African country, where mental development is uneven, where the violent collision of two worlds has considerably shaken old traditions and thrown the universe of the perceptions out of focus, the impressionability and sensibility of the Young African are at the mercy of the various assaults made upon them by the very Nature of Western Culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=194–195|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==British India==
[[File:British india.JPG|thumb|Territorial extent of British India.]]
During the period of the [[British Raj]], proponents of [[British Empire|British Imperialism]] typically regarded native [[Indian culture]] with disdain and supported European colonization as a beneficial "[[civilizing mission]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-13638-7|title=Cultural Heritage as Civilizing Mission {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Falser|first=Michael|publisher=Cham: Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=8–9|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-13638-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization was largely framed as an act of charity aimed at uplifting the "uncivilized" Indian, rather than an act of direct exploitation and domination; which targeted native cultural practices deemed to be "barbaric" by colonial administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer–Tiné|first=Harald|date=2016-07-26|title=Britain's other civilising mission|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001946460504200302|journal=The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=295–338|doi=10.1177/001946460504200302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals of Indian ancestry who adopt European culture, internalizing these colonial prejudices, have sometimes been labeled "Macaulay's Children". The term is usually used in a derogatory fashion, connoting disloyalty to India.

Prior to colonization by the Spanish (1565-1898), the [[Sulu Archipelago]] (located in southern Philippines) was a colony of the [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293–1527) based in Indonesia. The Americans were the last country to colonize the [[Philippines]] (1898–1946) and nationalists claim that it continues to act as a [[neo-colony]] of the US despite its formal independence in 1946.&lt;ref name="Gómez Rivera 2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gómez Rivera|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|García|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that fair skin was a characteristic of the cloistered ''[[binukot]]'', who were often kept indoors from a very early age. In historical epics of the Philippines their fair skin was presented as a standard of beauty among the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abrera|2008-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cite this as proof that desire for light-colored skin predates colonial influences.

One of the more adverse physical consequences in the idealization and acceptance of colonial mentality can be seen in the high rate of consumer demand for [[skin bleaching]] products used by some indigenous women and a smaller percentage of indigenous men and dark-skinned mestizas and mestizos, in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="americanchronicle.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston2003"&gt;Counter, S.

Since its release in 2006, the CASTp server has ∼ 45 000 visits and fulfills ∼ 33 000 calculation requests annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dundas|first=J.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Z.|last3=Tseng|first3=J.|last4=Binkowski|first4=A.|last5=Turpaz|first5=Y.|last6=Liang|first6=J.|date=2006-07-01|title=CASTp: computed atlas of surface topography of proteins with structural and topographical mapping of functionally annotated residues|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl282|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=34|issue=Web Server|pages=W116–W118|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl282|pmid=16844972|pmc=1538779|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASTp has been proven as a confident tool for a wide range of researches, including investigations of signaling receptors, discoveries of cancer therapeutics, understanding of mechanism of drug actions, studies of immune disorder diseases, analysis of protein–nanoparticle interactions, inference of protein functions and development of high-throughput computational tools. This server is maintained by [http://gila.bioe.uic.edu/lab/ Jie Liang's lab] in [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].

== 2. Geometric Modeling Principles ==
For the calculation strategy of CASTp, alpha-shape and discrete-flow methods are applied to the protein binding site, also the measurement of pocket size by the program of CAST by Liang et al in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|last2=Facello|first2=Michael|last3=Liang|first3=Jie|date=1998-11|title=On the definition and the construction of pockets in macromolecules|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=88|issue=1–3|pages=83–102|doi=10.1016/s0166-218x(98)00067-5|issn=0166-218X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Jie|last2=Woodward|first2=Clare|last3=Edelsbrunner|first3=Herbert|date=1998-09|title=Anatomy of protein pockets and cavities: Measurement of binding site geometry and implications for ligand design|journal=Protein Science|volume=7|issue=9|pages=1884–1897|doi=10.1002/pro.5560070905|pmid=9761470|pmc=2144175|issn=0961-8368}}&lt;/ref&gt; then updated by Tian et al in 2018. Firstly, CAST identifies atoms which form the protein pocket, then calculates the volume and area, identifies the atoms forming the rims of pocket mouth, computes how many mouth openings for each pocket, predict the area and circumference of mouth openings, finally locates cavities and calculate their size. The secondary structures were calculated by DSSP. The single amino acid annotations were fetched from UniProt database,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UniProt Consortium|first=The|date=2018-02-07|title=UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky092|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=46|issue=5|pages=2699|doi=10.1093/nar/gky092|pmid=29425356|pmc=5861450|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; then mapped to PDB structures following residue-level information from SIFTS database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velankar|first=Sameer|last2=Dana|first2=José M.|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Julius|last4=van Ginkel|first4=Glen|last5=Gane|first5=Paul J.|last6=Luo|first6=Jie|last7=Oldfield|first7=Thomas J.|last8=O’Donovan|first8=Claire|last9=Martin|first9=Maria-Jesus|date=2012-11-29|title=SIFTS: Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences resource|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1258|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=41|issue=D1|pages=D483–D489|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1258|pmid=23203869|pmc=3531078|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 3. Instructions of Protein Pocket Calculation ==
'''3.1 Input'''

Protein structures in PDB format, and a probe radius.

'''3.2 Searching'''

Users can either search for pre-computed result by 4-letter PDB ID, or upload their own PDB file for customized computation. The core algorithm helps in finding the pocket or cavity with capability of housing a solvent, with a default or adjusted diameter.  

'''3.3 Output'''

CASTp identifies all surface pockets, interior cavities and cross channels, provides detailed delineation of all atoms participating in their formation, including the area and volume of pocket or void as well as measurement of numbers of mouth opening of a particular pocket ID by [[Solvent accessible surface area|solvent accessible surface model]] (Richards' surface)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=B.|last2=Richards|first2=F.M.|date=1971-02|title=The interpretation of protein structures: Estimation of static accessibility|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=379–IN4|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(71)90324-x|issn=0022-2836}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by molecular surface model ([[Connolly surface]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=M.|date=1983-08-19|title=Solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins and nucleic acids|journal=Science|volume=221|issue=4612|pages=709–713|doi=10.1126/science.6879170|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; all calculated analytically.

== 4. Why CASTp is Useful? ==
'''4.1 Protein science, from an amino acid to sequences and structures'''

Proteins are large, complex molecules that playing critical roles to maintain the normal functioning of the human body. They are essential not just for the structure and function, but also the regulation among the body’s tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds of smaller units called amino acids that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain.

'''4.2 Protein active sites'''

Usually, the active site of a protein locates on its center of action and, the key to its function. The first step is the detection of active sites on the protein surface and an exact description of their features and boundaries. These specifications are vital inputs for subsequent target druggability prediction or target comparison. Most of the algorithms for active site detection are based on geometric modeling or energetic features based calculation.

'''4.3 The role of protein pockets'''

The shape and properties of the protein surface determine what interactions are possible with ligands and other macromolecules. Pockets are an important yet ambiguous feature of this surface. During drug discovery process, the first step in screening for lead compounds and potential molecules as drugs is usually a selection of the shape of the binding pocket. Shape plays a role in many computational pharmacological methods. Based on existing results, most features important to predicting drug-binding were depended on size and shape of the binding pocket, with the chemical properties of secondary importance. The surface shape is also important for interactions between protein and water. However, defining discrete pockets or possible interaction sites still remains unclear, due to the shape and location of nearby pockets affected promiscuity and diversity of binding sites. Since most pockets are open to solvent, to define the border of a pocket is the primary difficulty. Those closed to solvent we refer to as buried cavities. With the benefit of well-defined extent, area and volume, buried cavities are more straightforward to locate. In contrast, the border of an open pocket defines its mouth and it provides the cut-off for determination of the surface area and volume. Even defining the pocket as a set of residues does not define the volume or the mouth of the pocket.

'''4.4 Druggability role prediction'''

In pharmaceutical industry, the current priority strategy for target assessment is high-throughput screening (HTS). NMR screenings are applied against large compound datasets. Chemical characteristics of compounds binding against specific targets are measured, so how well the compound sets bind to the chemical space will decide the binding efficiency. Success rates of virtually docking of the drug-like ligands into the active sites of the target proteins would be detected for prioritization, while the most of the active sites located at the pockets.

With the benefits of large amount of structural data, computational methods from different perspectives for druggability prediction have been introduced during the last 30 years with positive results, as a vital instrument to accelerate the prediction accessibility.  Many candidates have been integrated into drug discovery pipeline already since then.

==5. New Features in CASTp 3.0==
'''5.1 Pre-computed results for biological assemblies'''

For a lot of proteins deposited in Protein Data Bank, the asymmetric unit might be different from biological unit, which would make the computational result biologically irrelevant. So the new CASTp 3.0 computed the topological features for biological assemblies, overcome the barriers between asymmetric unit and biological assemblies.

'''5.2 Imprints of negative volumes of topological features'''

In the 1st release of CASTp server in 2006, only geometric and topological features of those surface atoms participated in the formation of protein pockets, cavities, and channels. The new CASTp added the “negative volume” of the space, referred to the space encompassed by the atoms formed these geometric and topological features.

'''5.3 Comprehensive annotation on single amino-acid polymorphism'''

The latest CASTp integrated protein annotations aligned with the sequence, including the brief feature, positions, description, and reference of the domains, motifs, and single amino-acid polymorphisms.

'''5.4 Improved user interface &amp; convenient visualization'''

The new CASTp now incorporated 3Dmol.js for structural visualization, made users able to browse, to interact the protein 3D model, and to examine the computational results in latest web-browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, et al. Users can pick their own representation style of the atoms which form each topographic feature, and to edit the colors by their own preferences.

{{confuse|Deck (ship)}}
[[File:Parts of a truss bridge.svg|right|thumb|300px|The various parts of a truss bridge]] 

A '''deck''' is the surface of a [[bridge]].  A structural element of its [[Superstructure#bridge|superstructure]], it may be constructed of [[concrete]], [[steel]], [[grating|open grating]], or wood. Sometimes the deck is covered a [[track ballast|railroad bed]] and [[railroad track|track]], [[asphalt concrete]], or other form of [[pavement (material)|pavement]] for ease of vehicle crossing. A concrete deck may be an integral part of the bridge structure ([[T-beam]] or [[double tee]] structure) or it may be supported with [[I-beam]]s or steel [[girder]]s.

When a bridge deck is installed in a [[through truss]], it is sometimes called a floor system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A3oSAAAAYAAJ Members of a Truss Bridge], by Benj. F. La Rue, Home Study Magazine, Published by the Colliery Engineer Company, Vol 3, No. 2, March 1898, pages 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''suspended bridge deck''' will be suspended from the main structural elements on a suspension or arch bridge. On some bridges, such as a [[Tied-arch bridge|tied-arch]] or a [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]], the deck is a primary [[structural element]], carrying tension or compression to support the span.

==Structural analysis==
[[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] have several principal categories of bridge decks, for the purposes of analytic techniques. A ''beam deck'' is one where the deck and any supporting structure act together as a single beam. A ''grid deck'' uses [[Beam (structure)|beams]] and [[Diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]] as the supporting structure. The supporting system of a grid deck is analyzed using a grillage analysis. A ''slab deck'' is one where the deck is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the deck is known and analyzed as an [[orthotropic deck]]. A ''beam and slab deck'' is one where the beams may [[Deflection (engineering)|deflect]] somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the deck. A ''cellular deck'' is one where a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the deck. A ''boxgirder deck'' is one where the deck forms the top of the [[box girder]] during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hambly| first =E.

==Railway bridge decks==
[[File:Columbus and Greenville Railway bridge over Yazoo River.jpg|thumb|upright|An open-deck railway bridge in [[Leflore County, Mississippi]]]]

A [[railway bridge]] with its [[Track (rail transport)|track]] and [[Railroad tie|ties]] supported on load carrying elements of the superstructure (floor [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, [[stringer (stairs)|stringer]]s or [[girder]]s) is called an ''open deck''. When the track rests upon [[Track ballast|ballast]], which is then carried by the superstructure of the bridge, it is called a ''ballasted deck''. The term ''direct fixation'' is used when the rails are anchored directly to the superstructure of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorgenfrei| first1=Donald F.| last2=Marianos| first2=W.N.| date=Nov 4, 1999|chapter=Railroad Bridges| editor1-last=Chen| editor1-first=Wai-Fah| editor2-last=Lian| editor2-first=Duan| title=Bridge Engineering Handbook| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxYKgLVnT8YC|publisher=[[CRC Press]]| pages=23–5| isbn=0-8493-7434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eucrites''' are [[achondrite|achondritic]] stony [[meteorite]]s, many of which originate from the surface of the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]] and as such are part of the [[HED meteorite]] clan. They are the most common achondrite group with well over 100 distinct finds at present.

Eucrites consist of [[basalt]]ic rock from the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of [[4 Vesta]] or a similar parent body. They are mostly composed of [[Calcium|Ca]]-poor [[pyroxene]], [[pigeonite]], and [[Calcium|Ca]]-rich [[plagioclase]] ([[anorthite]]).&lt;ref&gt;B. Mason: Meteorites. John Wiley, New York 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on differences of chemical composition and features of the component crystals, they are subdivided into several groups:&lt;ref&gt;Mittlefehldt, McCoy, Goodrich and Kracher: Non-chondritic Meteorites from Asteroidal Bodies, In: Reviews in Mineralogy Vol. 36, Planetary Materials, Mineralogical Society of America, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Non-cumulate eucrites''' Are the most common variety and can be subdivided further:
** '''Main series eucrites''' formed near the surface and are mostly, though not exclusively,  [[regolith]] [[breccia]]s [[lithification|lithified]] under the pressure of overlying newer deposits.
** '''Stannern trend eucrites''' are a rare variety.
** '''Nuevo Laredo trend eucrites''' are thought to come from deeper layers of 4 Vesta's crust, and are a transition group towards the cumulate eucrites.
* '''Cumulate eucrites''' are rare types with oriented crystals, thought to have solidified in magma chambers deep within [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]'s crust.
* '''Polymict eucrites''' are [[regolith]] [[breccia]]s consisting of mostly eucrite fragments and less than one part in ten of [[diogenite]], an arbitrary dividing line from the [[howardite]]s, which are related in structure. They are comparably rare.

==Etymology==
Eucrites get their name from the Greek word ''eukritos'' meaning "easily distinguished". This refers to the silicate minerals in them, which can be easily distinguished because of their relatively large grain size. 

Eucrite is also a now obsolete term for [[bytownite]]-[[gabbro]], an [[igneous rock]] formed in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The term was used as a rock type name for some of the [[Paleogene]] igneous rocks of [[Geology of Scotland|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D. S. (1982) ''Igneous Rocks of the British Isles'', Chichester, John Wiley, page 536.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''floating airport''' is an airport built and situated on a [[very large floating structure]] (VLFS) located many miles out at sea utilizing a flotation type of device or devices such as [[Pneumatic stabilized platform|pneumatic stabilized platform (PSP)]] technology.

As the population increases and land becomes more expensive and scarce, [[very large floating structure]]s (VLFS) such as floating airports could help solve [[land use]], [[pollution]] and [[aircraft noise]] issues.

==Early history==
The first discussion of a floating airport was for [[Transatlantic flight|trans-Atlantic flights]]. At that time a passenger aircraft capable of making the trip could be built, but because of the massive need for fuel for the flight, it had a limited payload. An article appeared in the January 1930 issue of ''Popular Mechanics'' in which a model of a floating airport located in the Atlantic was proposed. To make safe flight possible with the aviation technology of that time, it called for eight such airports in the Atlantic. But unlike future floating airport ideas which were free floating, this 1930 concept had a floating airport platform, but with stabilizer legs which prevent the flight deck from pitching and rolling, similar in concept to some of today's off shore oil rigs. The cost of establishing eight such floating airports in 1930 was estimated at approximately USD$12,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ueQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PP8&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Mps3Ts_RNKL_sQLdiN0q&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Sea Legs of Floating Airport Prevents Rolls and Pitches" ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1930] Article and photo located bottom-right-side of page&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of floating airports was forgotten until in 1935 the famous French aviation pilot and builder [[Louis Blériot|Bleriot]] gave one of his last interviews in which he made the case for floating airports in mid-Atlantic; he called them '''Seadromes''' as a solution to economical trans-Atlantic passenger flights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJgvTv3XKdSgsQLVyIRv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "SEADROMES! Says Bleriot" ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In theory, issues and problems of land-based airports could be minimized by locating airports several miles off the coast. Takeoffs and landings would be over water, not over populated areas, thereby eliminating noise pollution and reducing risks of aircraft crashes to the land-locked population.

Since little of the ocean's surface is currently being used for human activity, growth and alterations in configuration would be relatively easy to achieve with minimal impact to the environment or to local residents who would utilize the airport. [[Water taxi]]s or other high speed surface vessels would be a part of an offshore [[mass transit system]] that could connect the floating airport to coastal communities and minimize traffic issues.

A floating structure, such as a floating airport, is theorised to have less impact on the environment than the land-based alternative. It would not require much, if any, dredging or moving of mountains or clearing of green space and the floating structure provides a [[reef]]-like environment conducive to marine life. In theory, [[wave energy]] could be harnessed, using the structure to convert waves into energy to help sustain the energy needs of the airport.

==Modern Floating airport projects==

{{anchor|Mega-Float}}In 2000, the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport]] sponsored the construction of Mega-Float,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlit.go.jp/english/maritime/mega_float.html Mega-Float]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1000-metre floating runway in [[Tokyo Bay]]. After conducting several real aircraft landings, the Ministry concluded that floating runways' hydro-elastic response would not affect aircraft operations, including precision instrument approaches in a protected waterway such as a large bay. The structure has been dismantled and is no longer in use.

The [[Pneumatic stabilized platform|pneumatic stabilized platform (PSP)]] was proposed as a means for constructing a new floating airport for [[San Diego]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], at least three miles off the tip of [[Point Loma]]. However, this proposed design was rejected in October, 2003 due to very high cost, the difficulty in accessing such an airport, the difficulty in transporting jet fuel, electricity, water, and gas to the structure, failure to address security concerns such as a bomb blast, inadequate room for high-speed exits and taxiways, and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.san.org/Airport_Authority/Airport_Site_Selection/faq.asp www.san.org dead link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105158/http://www.san.org/Airport_Authority/Airport_Site_Selection/faq.asp |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Achmad Yani International Airport]], the first floating airport in the world started construction on 17 June 2014, and  completed in 2018. However, only the passenger terminal and apron is floating.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}

The '''gene pool''' is the set of all [[gene]]s, or genetic information, in any [[population]], usually of a particular [[species]].

== Description ==
A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low [[genetic diversity]] (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and an increased chance of [[extinction]], although as explained by [[genetic drift]] new genetic variants, that may cause an increase in the [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of organisms, are more likely to fix in the population if it is rather small.

When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular [[phenotypic]] trait, the population is said to be 'monomorphic'. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are said to be [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]].

== History ==
The Russian geneticist Aleksandr Sergeevich Serebrovskii first formulated the concept in the 1920s as ''genofond'' (gene fund), a word that was imported to the United States from the Soviet Union by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], who translated it into English as “gene pool.”&lt;ref name="LonelyIdeas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Loren |date=2013 |title=Lonely Ideas: Can Russia Compete? |publisher=MIT Press |page=169 |isbn=978-0-262-01979-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gene pool concept in crop breeding ==
Harlan and de Wet (1971) proposed classifying each crop and its related species by gene pools rather than by formal taxonomy.&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harlan, J.R. |author2=Wet, J.M.J.d. |year=1971|title=Toward a Rational Classification of Cultivated Plants|journal=Taxon|volume=20|issue=4|pages=509–517|jstor=1218252|doi=10.2307/1218252}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Primary gene pool (GP-1): Members of this gene pool are probably in the same "[[species]]" (in conventional biological usage) and can intermate freely. Harlan and de Wet wrote, "Among forms of this gene pool, crossing is easy; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are generally fertile with good chromosome pairing; gene segregation is approximately normal and [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] is generally easy.".&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; They also advised subdividing each crop gene pool in two:
#*Subspecies A: Cultivated races
#*Subspecies B: Spontaneous races (wild or weedy)
#Secondary gene pool (GP-2): Members of this pool are probably normally classified as different species than the crop species under consideration (the primary gene pool). However, these species are closely related and can cross and produce at least some fertile hybrids. As would be expected by members of different species, there are some reproductive barriers between members of the primary and secondary gene pools:
#*hybrids may be weak
#*hybrids may be partially sterile
#*[[chromosomes]] may pair poorly or not at all
#*recovery of desired [[phenotype]]s may be difficult in subsequent generations
#*However, "The gene pool is available to be utilized, however, if the plant breeder or geneticist is willing to put out the effort required."&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt;
#Tertiary gene pool (GP-3): Members of this gene pool are more distantly related to the members of the primary gene pool. The primary and tertiary gene pools can be intermated, but [[gene]] transfer between them is impossible without the use of "rather extreme or radical measures" &lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; such as:
#*embryo rescue (or embryo culture, a form of plant [[organ culture]])
#*induced [[polyploidy]] (chromosome doubling)
#*bridging crosses (e.g., with members of the secondary gene pool).

== Gene pool centres ==
Gene pool centres refers to areas on the earth where important crop plants and domestic animals originated. They have an extraordinary range of the wild counterparts of cultivated plant species and useful tropical plants.
Gene pool centres also contain different sub tropical and temperate region species.

'''General chemistry'''
(sometimes called "gen chem" for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in [[chemistry]] and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a "weed out" course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as [[organic chemistry]] or [[analytical chemistry]].

General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as [[stoichiometry]], prediction of reaction products, [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[electrochemistry]], [[chemical kinetics]], and many of the rudiments of [[physical chemistry]]. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.

== Concepts Taught ==
The concepts taught in a typical general chemistry course are as follows:
*[[Stoichiometry]]
*[[Conservation of energy]]
*[[Conservation of mass]]
*[[Atom|Elementary atomic theory]]
*[[Periodic table|Periodic table and periodicity]]
*[[Law of constant composition]]
*[[Gas law]]s
*[[Nuclear chemistry]]
*[[Solubility]]
*[[Acid-base chemistry]]
*[[Chemical bonding]]
*[[Chemical kinetics]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Electrochemistry]]
*[[Chemical equilibrium|Chemical equilibria]]

The '''Goa Konkani Akademi''' (Goa Academy of Letters for Konkani) is an organization set up by the [[Government of Goa]] in 1986 to promote [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in [[Goa]]. Its stated aim is to accelerate the pace of development of Konkani by encouraging writers, researchers, etc. and to bring [[Konkani people|Konkanis]] from all areas together.&lt;ref name="gka_webs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/message.htm|title=Goa Konkani Akademi|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The Goa Konkani Akademi was founded on 4 March 1986.&lt;ref name="gaionam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songs-from-goa.at/goa/docs/essay.htm#_ftnref27 |title=GOENCHIM KONKNNI GAIONAM |last=de Noronha |first=Lourenço |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an autonomous body and has jurisdiction over the state of Goa.&lt;ref name="gka_ct_chart"/&gt; It undertakes activities for the development and promotion of Konkani. GKA receives grants from the Government of Goa.&lt;ref name="legis_goa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goavidhansabha.gov.in/uploads/docs/465_ff_FIRST%20HOME.pdf |title=FIFTH LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF GOA |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Akademi President is [[Pundalik Naik]] (2002- present). Past presidents were [[Purushottam Kakodkar]] (1984-1996) and [[Uday Bhembre]] (1996-2002) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm |title=Officers Of Goa Konkani Akademi |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223190600/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm |archivedate=23 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and Objectives==
The Akademi was built with the purpose of promoting  the growth of Konkani. Some of the major goals stated on its website are:
#To initiate, assist or undertake implementation of projects or schemes of research in the field of Konkani language, literature and culture. 
#To initiate, assist or undertake publication in Konkani language, the results of such research. 
#To initiate, assist or undertake publication in Konkani language of original and erudite papers, monographs, books, journal, as also of any other works in any other branch of knowledge.

The GKA carries out its activities under directions issued to it by the Government of Goa. It also assists the state Government in formulating various policies in regard to Konkani.&lt;ref name="gka_ct_chart"/&gt; 

==Activities==
The GKA conducts various activities
#Providing financial assistance(75% of cost) to the first book by a new author.
#Provides 50% financial assistance to publishers and purchases 100 copies of each book.
#Section on folklore
#Has undertaken a project to publish a dictionary-cum-encyclopedia in Konkani.
#Conducts a "Knowledge of Konkani" certificate test which is necessary for Government Jobs in Goa. Also has other certificate exams.
#Has organized a five-day annual cultural event since 1993.&lt;ref name="gka_ct_chart"/&gt;

==Organization Structure==
The Organization has various sections
#'''Education Section''': Post-graduate and certificate courses; teacher training
#'''Lexicon Section''': Creation of Konkani encyclopedia and dictionaries
#'''Folklore Section''': collection of various media related to folklore
#'''Literature Section''': Oversees various publication schemes
#'''Cultural Section''': Drama, ''tiatr''(theatre) and documentaries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/akademi/sections.htm |title=GKA |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224191230/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/akademi/sections.htm |archivedate=24 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The GKA has been accused of being biased against Konkani publications in the [[Konkani in the Roman script|Roman script]] in the past. Another demand has been that the GKA should be headed by persons of both the major communities in Goa([[Hindus]] and [[Christians]]) by rotation.&lt;ref name="Konkaniworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713165258/http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-13 |title=Konkaniworld - Script for Konkani |last=Lopes |first=Nelson |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredrick Noronha]] has criticized the way the GKA distributes books. He blames the "low-price, no-distributor-margins policy" as being responsible for the lack of interest by distributors, and hence low readership of its books.&lt;ref name="Fredrick_Noronha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericknoronha.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/learn-konkani-the-romi-way/|title=Learn Konkani, the Romi way|last=Noronha|first=Frederick|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Goa Konkani Akademi's office is situated at [[Patto Colony]], [[Panaji]], [[Goa]].&lt;ref name="gka_ct_chart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/akademi/ct.htm |title=CITIZENS CHARTER - GOA KONKANI AKADEMI |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224191212/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/akademi/ct.htm |archivedate=24 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was in use at least as early as 1966 amongst staff and students in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, England.  A similar concept, that of the '''gnostic neuron''', was proposed two years later by [[Jerzy Konorski]].&lt;ref&gt;Konorski J. 1967. ''Integrative activity of the brain; an interdisciplinary approach.''(1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face selective cells===
Visual neurons in the [[inferior temporal cortex]] of the monkey fire selectively to hands and faces.&lt;ref&gt;Gross CG. 1998a. ''Brain, vision, memory: tales in the history of neuroscience.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perrett | first1 = DI | last2 = Rolls | first2 = ET | last3 = Caan | first3 = W | year = 1982 | title = Visual neurons responsive to faces in the monkey temporal cortex. | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 329–42 | doi=10.1007/bf00239352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolls ET. 1984. ''Neurons in the cortex of the temporal lobe and in the amygdala of the monkey with responses selective for faces.'' Hum Neurobiol 3:209–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamane | first1 = S | last2 = Kaji | first2 = S | last3 = Kawano | first3 = K | year = 1988 | title = What facial features activate face neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of the monkey? | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 209–14 | doi=10.1007/bf00279674}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are selective in that they do not fire for other visual objects important for monkeys such as fruit and genitalia. Research finds that some of these cells  can be trained to show high specificity for arbitrary visual objects, and these would seem to fit the requirements of gnostic/grandmother cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logothetis | first1 = NK | last2 = Sheinberg | first2 = DL | year = 1996 | title = Visual object recognition. | url = | journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 577–621 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.19.030196.003045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka K. 1996. ''Inferotemporal cortex and object vision.'' Annu Rev Neurosci 19:109–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, evidence exists for cells in the human [[hippocampus]] that have highly selective responses to gnostic categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = CG | year = 2000 | title = Coding for visual categories in the human brain | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 855–6 | doi=10.1038/78745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreiman | first1 = G | last2 = Koch | first2 = C | last3 = Fried | first3 = I | year = 2000 | title = Category specific visual responses of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe | doi = 10.1038/78868 | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 946–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including highly selective responses to individual human faces.&lt;ref&gt;Kreiman G, Fried I, Koch C. 2001. ''Single neuron responses in humans during binocular rivalry and flash suppression''. ''Abstr Soc Neurosci'' 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However most of the reported face-selective cells are not grandmother/gnostic cells since they do not represent a specific percept, that is, they are not cells narrowly selective in their activations for one face and only one face irrespective of transformations of size, orientation, and color. Even the most selective face cells usually also discharge, if more weakly, to a variety of individual faces. Furthermore, face-selective cells often vary in their responsiveness to different aspects of faces. This suggests that cell responsiveness arises from the need of a monkey to differentiate among different individual faces rather than among other categories of stimuli such as bananas with their discrimination properties linked to the fact that different individual faces are much more similar to each other in their overall organization and fine detail than other kinds of stimuli.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt; Moreover, it has been suggested that these cells might in fact be responding as specialized feature detector neurons that only function in the holistic context of a face construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jagadeesh | first1 = B | year = 2009 | title = Recognizing grandmother | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 12 | issue = 9| pages = 1083–5 | doi = 10.1038/nn0909-1083 | pmid = 19710647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freiwald | first1 = WA | last2 = Tsao | first2 = DY | last3 = Livingstone | first3 = MS | year = 2009 | title = A face feature space in the macaque temporal lobe | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 12 | issue = 9| pages = 1187–96 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2363 | pmid = 19668199 | pmc=2819705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea has been that such cells form ensembles for the coarse or distributed coding of faces rather than detectors for specific faces. Thus, a specific grandmother may be represented by a specialized ensemble of grandmother or near grandmother cells.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt;

===Individual specific recognition cells===
In 2005, a [[UCLA]] and [[Caltech]] study found evidence of different cells that fire in response to particular people, such as [[Bill Clinton]] or [[Jennifer Aniston]].  A neuron for [[Halle Berry]], for example, might respond "to the concept, the [[abstract entity]], of Halle Berry", and would fire not only for images of Halle Berry, but also to the actual name "Halle Berry".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045| pages = 1102–1107 | doi = 10.1038/nature03687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is no suggestion in that study that only the cell being monitored responded to that concept, nor was it suggested that no other actress would cause that cell to respond (although several other presented images of actresses did not cause it to respond).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The researchers believe that they have found evidence for [[sparseness]], rather than for grandmother cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Sparse but not 'Grandmother-cell' coding in the medial temporal lobe | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 87–91| doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2007.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for the theory that a small neural network provides facial recognition was found from analysis of cell recording studies of macaque monkeys. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, the scientists discovered that each face cell’s firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble of about 200 cells to encode the location of any face in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang, Tsao|first=|date=2017|title=The Code for Facial Identity in the Primate Brain|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.011|journal=Cell|volume=169|pages=1013–1028|via=Elsevier Inc.|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sparseness vs distributed representations==

The grandmother cell hypothesis, is an extreme version of the idea of  [[sparseness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; and is not without critics. The opposite of the grandmother cell theory is the distributed representation theory, that states that a specific stimulus is coded by its unique pattern of activity over a large group of neurons widely distributed in the brain.

The arguments against the sparseness include: 
#According to some theories, one would need thousands of cells for each face, as any given face must be recognised from many different angles &amp;ndash; profile, 3/4 view, full frontal, from above, ''etc.'' 
#Rather than becoming more and more specific as visual processing proceeds from retina through the different visual centres of the brain, the image is partially dissected into basic features such as vertical lines, colour, speed, ''etc.'', distributed in various modules separated by relatively large distances.  How all these disparate features are re-integrated to form a seamless whole is known as the [[binding problem]].  &lt;!-- why does this argue against the GM Cell theory? --&gt;

==Pontifical cells==
[[William James]] in 1890 proposed a related idea of a pontifical cell.&lt;ref&gt;James W. (1890). The principles of psychology.
New York: Dover&lt;/ref&gt; The pontifical cell is defined as a putative, and implausible cell which had all our experiences. It is in this different from a concept specific cell in that it is the site of experience of sense data. James's 1890 pontifical cell was instead a cell "to which the rest of the brain provided a representation" of a grandmother. The experience of grandmother occurred in this cell.

The '''Gromov Flight Research Institute''' or '''GFRI''' for short ({{lang-ru|link=no|Лётно-исследовательский институт имени М.&amp;nbsp;М.&amp;nbsp;Громова}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|ЛИИ}}) is an important Russian State Research Center which operates aircraft test base located in [[Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast|Zhukovsky]], 40&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Moscow. The airfield is also known as [[Ramenskoye, Moscow Oblast|Ramenskoye]] air base.

It has [[List of longest runways|world's second longest public-use runway]], at {{convert|5402|m|abbr=on}} with concrete surfacing covers the area of 2.5&amp;nbsp;million square meters. 
The airfield was used as the backup landing site for the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Shuttle Buran]] test program and also as a test base for a Buran's [[aerodynamic]] [[prototype]]s. (See [[OK-GLI]])

GFRI periodically hosts the [[MAKS (air show)|MAKS]] event, the International Air Show (Aviasalon).&lt;!-- The next ([[MAKS Airshow|MAKS]] 2019) is scheduled to take place also in Zhukovsky.--&gt;

At present, GFRI is also hosted [[Zhukovsky International Airport]].

== History ==
The Flight Research Institute was founded on March 8, 1941, in accordance with the decree of [[Sovnarkom]] and the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. [[Mikhail Gromov (aviator)|Mikhail Gromov]], a [[test pilot]], [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], became its first chief. From the very beginning the Institute participated in development and testing of aircraft and airborne systems, conducted flight research in order to pave the way to further scientific activities.

The first years of the Institute's existence fell on the [[Great Patriotic War|war times]]. During the war experts of the institute kept developing recommendations to eliminate defects in flight qualities and war-fighting capabilities of the aircraft, flight testing of the aircraft prototypes, studied the foreign aircraft and equipment, both purchased and taken as trophies.

=== Cold War ===
Zhukovsky airfield was the Soviet Union's equivalent to the US Edwards AFB and as such many types of aircraft underwent evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;https://thelexicans.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/western-aircraft-in-the-ussr/&lt;/ref&gt;

Here some western aircraft were tested or analyzed. it’s unknown if any flight evaluations were made by the USSR. Google Earth look around for the Ramenskoye Airport shows an F-4 parked there.
* Wrecks from F-111s shot down over North Vietnam were sent to Zhukovskiy to be analyzed.
* Pieces of US planes shot down in North Vietnam and their captured electronic countermeasures equipment were taken for evaluation (F-111, A-6, A-7, B-52, F-4, F105, etc.).
* Captured VNAF helicopters are believed to have been tested (UH-1H, CH-47).

=== Perestroika times ===
[[File:Ilyushin Il-76LL (RA-76529 (cn 073410308)) D-236T Propfan Engine.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ilyushin Il-76]]LL testbed with [[Progress D-27]] engine prototype]]
Due to financial problems in the 1990s ([[perestroika]] times), tourist fighter flights in former secret jets became available, mainly for wealthy western tourists. The security check was comparable to the Russian visa. On offer for flights was the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] jet trainer, the Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] for stratosphere "Edge of Space"-flights, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] Fulcrum and even the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] Flanker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migflug.com Sukhoi Su-27 Flight, Zhukovsky Airbase]&lt;/ref&gt; From June 2006, flights stopped on Zhukovsky. Today, flights in the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] are available with the famous [[Aerobatic]] Team Wjasma Rus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vyazmarus.com Vyazma Rus Display Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202194808/http://vyazmarus.com/ |date=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] Fulcrum flights are available in Nizhniy Novgorod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migflug.com/en/jet-fighter-flights/flying-with-a-jet/mig-29-fulcrum-in-russia.html MiG-29 in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sukhoi Su-27P in 1995.jpg|thumb|250px|Modified [[Sukhoi Su-27]]P aeroplane (1995)]]

The airline was established by the institute in 1995 as a wholly owned commercial subsidiary and named Gromov Air (later [[Moskovia Airlines]]).

[[Image:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|Water balance]]
'''Groundwater recharge''' or '''deep drainage''' or '''deep percolation''' is a [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] process where [[water]] moves downward from [[surface water]] to [[groundwater]]. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an [[aquifer]].  This process usually occurs in the [[vadose zone]] below plant [[root]]s and is often expressed as a [[flux]] to the [[water table]] surface. Recharge occurs both naturally (through the [[water cycle]]) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., "artificial groundwater recharge"), where rainwater and or [[reclaimed water]] is routed to the subsurface.

==Processes==
Groundwater is recharged naturally by [[rain]] and [[snow]] melt and to a smaller extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). Recharge  may be impeded somewhat by human activities including paving, development, or [[logging]].  These activities can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced [[surface runoff]] and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for [[irrigation]], may also lower the water tables. Groundwater recharge is an important process for [[sustainable]] groundwater management, since the volume-rate [[water abstraction|abstracted]] from an [[aquifer]] in the long term should be less than or equal to the volume-rate that is recharged.

Recharge can help move excess salts that accumulate in the root zone to deeper soil layers, or into the groundwater system. Tree roots increase water [[Soil#Soil water|saturation]] into [[groundwater]] reducing water [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="trees water infiltration"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | title=Urban Trees Enhance Water Infiltration | publisher=The American Society of Agronomy | work=Fisher, Madeline | date=November 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 31, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602034025/https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | archivedate=June 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Flooding]] temporarily increases [[stream bed|river bed]] [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] by moving clay soils downstream, and this increases aquifer recharge.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/major-floods-recharge-aquifers/ | title=Major floods recharge aquifers | publisher=University of New South Wales Science | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial groundwater recharge is becoming increasingly important in India, where [[Overdrafting|over-pumping]] of groundwater by farmers has led to underground resources becoming depleted. In 2007, on the recommendations of the [[International Water Management Institute]], the Indian government allocated {{INRConvert|1800|c|year=2007}} to fund dug-well [[Aquifer storage and recovery|recharge projects]] (a dug-well is a wide, shallow well, often lined with concrete) in 100 districts within seven states where water stored in hard-rock aquifers had been over-exploited. Another environmental issue is the disposal of waste through the water flux such as dairy farms, industrial, and urban [[Surface runoff|runoff]].

===Wetlands===
[[Wetlands]] help maintain the level of the water table and exert control on the hydraulic head (O'Brien 1988; Winter 1988). This provides force for groundwater recharge and discharge to other waters as well. The extent of groundwater recharge by a wetland is dependent upon [[soil type|soil]], [[vegetation]], site, perimeter to volume ratio, and water table gradient (Carter and Novitzki 1988; Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge occurs through [[soil type|mineral soils]] found primarily around the edges of wetlands (Verry and Timmons 1982) The soil under most wetlands is relatively impermeable. A high perimeter to volume ratio, such as in small wetlands, means that the surface area through which water can infiltrate into the groundwater is high (Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge is typical in small wetlands such as [[Prairie Pothole Region|prairie potholes]], which can contribute significantly to recharge of regional groundwater resources (Weller 1981). Researchers have discovered groundwater recharge of up to 20% of wetland volume per season (Weller 1981).

===Depression-focused recharge===
If water falls uniformly over a field such that [[field capacity]] of the soil is not exceeded, then negligible water percolates to [[groundwater]].  If instead water puddles in low-lying areas, the same water volume concentrated over a smaller area may exceed field capacity resulting in water that percolates down to recharge groundwater.  The larger the relative contributing runoff area is, the more focused infiltration is.  The recurring process of water that falls relatively uniformly over an area, flowing to groundwater selectively under surface depressions is depression focused recharge.  Water tables rise under such depressions.

====Depression pressure====
Depression focused groundwater recharge can be very important in [[arid region]]s.  More rain events are capable of contributing to groundwater supply.

Depression focused groundwater recharge also profoundly effects [[contaminant]] transport into groundwater.  This is of great concern in regions with [[karst]] geological formations because water can eventually dissolve tunnels all the way to [[aquifer]]s, or otherwise disconnected streams.  This extreme form of preferential flow, accelerates the transport of contaminants and the [[erosion]] of such [[tunnel]]s.  In this way depressions intended to trap [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water—before it flows to vulnerable water resources—can connect underground over time.  [[Cavitation]] of surfaces above into the tunnels, results in [[pothole]]s or caves.

Deeper ponding exerts [[pressure]] that forces water into the ground faster.  Faster flow dislodges contaminants otherwise adsorbed on soil and carries them along. This can carry [[pollution]] directly to the raised [[water table]] below and into the [[groundwater supply]].  Thus the quality of water collecting in [[infiltration basin]]s is of special concern.

====Pollution====
Pollution in stormwater [[Surface runoff|runoff]] collects in retention basins.  Concentrating degradable contaminants can accelerate [[biodegradation]].  However, where and when water tables are high this affects appropriate design of [[detention pond]]s, [[retention pond]]s and [[rain garden]]s.

==Estimation methods==

Rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to quantify since other related processes, such as [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] (or [[evapotranspiration]]) and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] processes must first be measured or estimated to determine the balance.

===Physical===

Physical methods use the principles of [[soil physics]] to estimate recharge. The ''direct'' physical methods are those that attempt to actually measure the volume of water passing below the root zone. ''Indirect'' physical methods rely on the measurement or estimation of soil physical parameters, which along with soil physical principles, can be used to estimate the potential or actual recharge. After months without rain the level of the rivers under humid climate is low and represents solely drained groundwater. Thus, the recharge can be calculated from this base flow if the catchment area is already known.

===Chemical===

Chemical methods use the presence of relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] water-soluble substances, such as an [[isotopic tracer]] or [[chloride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=G.B. |author2=Hughes, M.W. |year=1978 |title=The use of environmental chloride and tritium to estimate total recharge to an unconfined aquifer |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=16 |pages=181–195 |doi=10.1071/SR9780181 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving through the soil, as deep drainage occurs.

===Numerical models===

Recharge can be estimated using [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], using such [[Source code|codes]] as [[Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance]], [[UNSAT-H]], [[SHAW]], [[Weap|WEAP]], and [[MIKE SHE]]. The 1D-program [[Hydrus (software)|HYDRUS1D]] is available online. The codes generally use [[climate]] and [[soil]] data to arrive at a recharge estimate and use the [[Richards equation]] in some form to model groundwater flow in the [[vadose zone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''HTTP tunneling''' is used to create a network link between two computers in conditions of restricted network connectivity including [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Network address translation|NAT]]s and [[Access control list#Networking_ACLs|ACL]]s, among other restrictions. The tunnel is created by an intermediary called a [[Proxy server|proxy server]] which is usually located in a [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]].

Tunneling can also allow communication using a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] that normally wouldn’t be supported on the restricted network.


== HTTP CONNECT method ==
The most common form of HTTP tunneling is the standardized [[Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods|HTTP CONNECT]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title= Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 |rfc= 2616 |sectionname= Method Definitions, CONNECT |section= 9.9 |page= 56 |last= Fielding |first= R. |year= 1999 |month= June |publisher= [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate= 2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2817) |rfc= 2817 |accessdate= 3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this mechanism, the client asks an HTTP proxy server to forward the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection to the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client. Only the initial connection request is HTTP - after that, the server simply proxies the established TCP connection.

This mechanism is how a client behind an HTTP proxy can access websites using [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] or TLS (i.e. HTTPS). Proxy servers may also limit connections by only allowing connections to the default HTTPS port 443, [[Whitelist|whitelisting]] hosts, or blocking traffic which doesn't appear to be SSL.

===Example negotiation===
The client connects to the proxy server and requests tunneling by specifying the port and the host computer it would like to connect to. The port is used to indicate the protocol being requested.&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="http"&gt;
CONNECT example.host.com:22 HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials

&lt;/source&gt;

If the connection was allowed and the proxy has connected to the specified host then the proxy will return a 2XX success response.&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="http"&gt;
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

&lt;/source&gt;
 
The client is now being proxied to the remote host. Any data sent to the proxy server is now forwarded, unmodified, to the remote host&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the client can communicate using any protocol accepted by the remote host.
In the example below, the client is starting SSH communications as hinted to, by the port number, in the initial CONNECT request.

 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.3\r\n
 ...

== HTTP tunneling without using CONNECT ==
A HTTP tunnel can also be implemented using only the usual HTTP methods as POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. This is similar to the approach used in Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP ([[BOSH (protocol)|BOSH]]).

In this {{Citation/make link|https://github.com/luizluca/bridge|proof-of-concept program }}, a special HTTP server runs outside the protected network and a client program is run on a computer inside the protected network. Whenever any network traffic is passed from the client, the client repackages the traffic data as a HTTP request and relays the data to the outside server, which extracts and executes the original network request for the client. The response to the request, sent to the server, is then repackaged as an HTTP response and relayed back to the client. Since all traffic is encapsulated inside normal GET and POST requests and responses, this approach works through most proxies and firewalls.

The '''Health and Retirement Study''' (HRS)&lt;ref&gt;National Institute on Aging, [http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ExtramuralPrograms/BehavioralAndSocialResearch/HRS.htm Growing Older in America: The Health and Retirement Study], Washington, DC, National Institutes of Health, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over age 50 conducted by the Survey Research Center (SCR) at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]] and supported by the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA). The study interviews approximately 20,000 respondents every two years on subjects like health care, housing, assets,&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, M.D., Juster F.T. and Smith J.P.

Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. pp. 309-326.&lt;/ref&gt; employment and disability. The study is managed through a cooperative agreement (NIA U01AG009740) between the NIA, which provides primary funding, and the ISR, which administers and conducts the survey. Beginning in  2012, HRS began adding [[genetic information]] from consenting participants to its database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nia.nih.gov/newsroom/2012/03/nia-adds-genetic-data-health-and-retirement-study "NIA adds genetic data to Health and Retirement Study"], Washington, DC, National Institutes of Health, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic measures captured by the data in the HRS are regarded as being of very high quality.&lt;ref&gt;French, E., Jones, J. &amp; McCauley, J. (2017). The Accuracy of Economic Measurement in the Health and Retirement Study. Forum for Health Economics and Policy, 0(0), pp. -. Available at doi:10.1515/fhep-2017-0001 &lt;/ref&gt; 


==Purpose==

The HRS is designed to inform the national retirement discussion as the population ages. The inspiration for the HRS emerged in the mid-1980s, when scientists at NIA and elsewhere recognized the need for a new national survey of America’s expanding older population. By that time, it had become clear that the mainstay of retirement research, the Retirement History Study (RHS), conducted from 1969 to 1979, was no longer adequately addressing contemporary retirement issues. For example, the RHS sample underrepresented women, Blacks, and Hispanics who, by the mid-1980s were a growing part of the labor force. The RHS also did not ask about health or physical or mental function, all of which can affect the decision and ability to retire. Moreover, research on the retirement process was fragmented, with economists, sociologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, demographers, and biomedical researchers proposing and conducting studies within their own "silos," often without regard to the relevant research activities of other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, W.L. and Herzog, A.R. Collecting data about the oldest old: Problems and procedures. In: The Oldest Old, eds., Richard M. Suzman, David P. Willis, and Kenneth G. Manton. New York: Oxford University Press. 1992. pp. 135-156&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining that a new approach was needed, an Ad Hoc Advisory Panel was convened by the [[National Institute on Aging]]. In early 1988 the panel recommended the initiation of a new, long-term study to examine the ways in which older adults’ changing health interacts with social, economic, and psychological factors and retirement decisions. Government experts and academic researchers from diverse disciplines were recruited to collaboratively create and design the study. Ultimately, relevant executive agencies and the [[United States Congress]] recognized the value of this major social science investment, and the HRS was established.
==Administrative Information==
Many individuals and institutions have contributed to the planning, design, development, and ongoing administration of the study. This includes the study’s leadership at the Institute for Social Research, specifically the first HRS Director, [[F. Thomas Juster]], who led the effort to initiate the HRS,&lt;ref&gt;Wealth, Work, and Health: Innovations in Measurement in the Social Sciences: Essays in honor of F. Thomas Juster, Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Willis, the Director from 1995 to 2007, and David R. Weir, the current Director. HRS relies on the contributions of the HRS co-investigators, a multidisciplinary group of leading academic researchers at the University of Michigan and other institutions nationwide, a steering committee and working groups, which have provided critical advice about the study’s design and monitored its progress, and the NIA-HRS Data Monitoring Committee, an advisory group of independent members of the academic research community and representatives of agencies interested in the study. 

In addition, the [[Social Security Administration]] has provided technical advice and substantial support for the study. Over the HRS’s history, other important contributors have included the [[United States Department of Labor]]’s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and the State of [[Florida]].

==Related Studies==
The HRS has a number of sister studies in other countries. In recent years, the HRS has been extended to several Asian countries, including Korea ([[the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging or KLoSA]]), Japan (the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement or JSTAR), China ([[Chinese Health and Retirement Survey|the Chinese Health and Retirement Survey or CHARLS]]), India (The Longitudinal Aging Study in India or LASI) and New Zealand (Health, Work and Retirement Study). Population aging is very rapid in Asia and India and China alone will have more than one billion people over age 60 during this century. CHARLS is headed by a team at the Chinese Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University under the direction of Professor Zhao Yaohui. LASI is jointly headed by a team from Harvard University under the direction of Professor David Bloom and the International Institute of Population Studies (IIPS) in Mumbai India. Both CHARLS and LASI were awarded peer review grants to conduct pilot studies by the National Institute of Aging in the United States. Other studies include:
* [[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA)
* Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS)
* [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe]] (SHARE)
* New Zealand Health, Work and Retirement Survey
* Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging
* [[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)|WHO's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health]] (SAGE)

* Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI)
* [[Chinese Health and Retirement Survey|the Chinese Health and Retirement Survey]] (CHARLS)
* the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR)
* the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA)

The Gateway to Global Aging Data, a resource that facilitates the use and harmonization of the different datasets of HRS and sister studies in other countries has been developed with support of the [[National Institute on Aging]], National Institutes of Health (RC2 AG036619-01 and R01 AG030153)

In the context of [[human evolution]], '''human vestigiality''' involves those [[phenotypic trait|traits]] (such as [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or [[behavior]]s) occurring in [[human]]s that have lost all or most of their original [[function (biology)|function]] through [[evolution]]. Although structures called ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial]]'' often appear functionless, a vestigial structure may retain lesser functions or develop minor new ones. In some cases, structures once identified as vestigial simply had an unrecognized function.

The examples of human vestigiality are numerous, including the anatomical (such as the human [[Coccyx|tailbone]], [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], and [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|inside corner of the eye]]), the behavioral ([[goose bumps]] and [[palmar grasp reflex]]), and molecular ([[pseudogene]]s). Many human characteristics are also vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== History ==
[[Charles Darwin]] listed a number of putative human vestigial features, which he termed rudimentary, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' (1890). These included the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also commented on the sporadic nature of many vestigial features, particularly musculature. Making reference to the work of the anatomist [[William Turner (anatomist)|William Turner]], Darwin highlighted a number of sporadic muscles which he identified as vestigial remnants of the [[panniculus carnosus]], particularly the [[sternalis muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C, ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'', London: John Murray, 1890, p.13.[https://archive.org/details/ajp4619.0001.001.umich.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner W, ''On the musculus sternalis'', Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh session 1866–1867, p.65.[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingso618661869roya#page/64/mode/2up/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published [[Robert Wiedersheim#The Structure of Man|''The Structure of Man'']], a book on [[human anatomy]] and its relevance to man's evolutionary history. This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial, or as Wiedersheim himself explained: "Organs having become wholly or in part functionless, some appearing in the Embryo alone, others present during Life constantly or inconstantly. For the greater part Organs which may be rightly termed Vestigial."&lt;ref name="The Structure of Man"&gt;Wiedersheim, R. (1893) ''The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History''. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. [https://archive.org/details/structureofmanin00wiediala]&lt;/ref&gt; His list of supposedly vestigial organs included many of the examples on this page as well as others then mistakenly believed to be purely vestigial, such as the [[pineal gland]], the [[thymus gland]], and the [[pituitary gland]]. Some of these organs that had lost their obvious, original functions later turned out to have retained functions that had gone unrecognized before the discovery of hormones or many of the functions and tissues of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller, G. B. (2002) "Vestigial Organs and Structures." in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 1131–1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Koerth-Baker | first=Maggie | title=Vestigial Organs Not So Useless After All | date=30 July 2009 | work=National Geographic | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090730-spleen-vestigial-organs.html | accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included:
* the role of the pineal in the regulation of the [[circadian rhythm]] (neither the function nor even the existence of melatonin was yet known);
* discovery of the role of the [[thymus]] in the immune system lay many decades in the future; it remained a mystery organ until after the mid-20th century;
* the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[hypothalamus]] with their many and varied hormones were far from understood, let alone the complexity of their interrelationships.

Historically, there was a trend not only to dismiss the [[vermiform appendix]] as being uselessly vestigial, but an anatomical hazard, a liability to [[Appendicitis|dangerous inflammation]]. As late as the mid-20th century, many reputable authorities conceded it no beneficial function.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF"&gt;Wells, H.g. Huxley, J. Wells, G. P. The Science of Life. Pub. Cassell 1931&lt;/ref&gt; This was a view supported, or perhaps inspired, by Darwin himself in the 1874 edition of his book [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. The organ's patent liability to appendicitis and its poorly understood role left the appendix open to blame for a number of possibly unrelated conditions. For example, in 1916, a surgeon claimed that removal of the appendix had cured several cases of [[Trigeminal neuralgia|trifacial neuralgia]] and other nerve pain about the head and face, even though he stated that the evidence for appendicitis in those patients was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, M. I.: Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 67, Issues 15-26, 1916. Page 1326&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of hormones and hormonal principles, notably by [[Endocrinology|Bayliss and Starling]], argued against these views, but in the early twentieth century, there remained a great deal of fundamental research to be done on the functions of large parts of the digestive tract. In 1916, an author found it necessary to argue against the idea that the colon had no important function and that "...the ultimate disappearance of the appendix is a coordinate action and not necessarily associated with such frequent inflammations as we are witnessing in the human..."&lt;ref&gt;W. Colin MacKenzie. A Contribution to the Biology of the Vermiform Appendix. Medical record, Volume 89 Page 342 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been a long history of doubt about such dismissive views. Around 1920, the prominent surgeon [[Kenelm Hutchinson Digby]] documented previous observations, going back more than thirty years, that suggested lymphatic tissues, such as the tonsils and appendix, may have substantial immunological functions.

[[File:Ileum-Caecum-Colon of rabbit IMG 5771.JPG|thumb|Ileum, caecum and colon of rabbit, showing ''Appendix vermiformis'' on fully functional [[caecum]].]]
[[File:Gray536.png|right|thumb|The human vermiform appendix on the vestigial caecum.]]
In modern humans, the [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions, much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze [[cellulose]] and similar indigestible plant materials.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871). ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Some herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, have a terminal vermiform appendix and [[cecum]] that apparently bear patches of tissue with immune functions and may also be important in maintaining the composition of [[intestinal flora]]. It does not however seem to have much digestive function, if any, and is not present in all herbivores, even those with large caeca.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian | title = Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-61714-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the accompanying pictures however, the human appendix typically is about comparable to that of the rabbit's in size, though the caecum is reduced to a single bulge where the ileum empties into the colon.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF" /&gt; Some carnivorous animals may have appendices too, but seldom have more than vestigial caeca.&lt;ref name="StPRCESD"&gt;Peter Robert Cheeke, Ellen S. Dierenfeld, Comparative Animal Nutrition and Metabolism. Publisher: CABI;  2010 {{ISBN|978-1-84593-631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions, some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion, though that is unlikely to be a novel function, given the presence of vermiform appendices in many herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21153898/|title=Appendix may be useful after all – Health – Health care – More health news – NBC News|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Randal Bollinger |first1=R. |last2=Barbas |first2=Andrew S. |last3=Bush |first3=Errol L. |last4=Lin |first4=Shu S. |last5=Parker |first5=William |title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=249 |issue=4 |pages=826–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17936308 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intestinal bacterial populations entrenched in the appendix may support quick re-establishment of the flora of the large intestine after an illness, poisoning, or after an antibiotic treatment depletes or otherwise causes harmful changes to the bacterial population of the colon.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Q. Choi, "The Appendix: Useful and in Fact Promising", ''Live Science'', 2009, [http://www.livescience.com/10571-appendix-fact-promising.html Appendix has useful function]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. It is widely present in [[euarchontoglires]] (a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates) and has also evolved [[Convergent evolution|independently]] in the [[diprotodont]] [[marsupials]], [[monotreme]]s, and is highly diverse in size and shape which could suggest it is not vestigial. Researchers deduce that the appendix has the ability to protect good bacteria in the gut. That way, when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines, the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep the person healthy.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x |pmid=19678866 |title=Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1984–99 |year=2009 |last1=Smith |first1=H.

=== Coccyx ===
The [[coccyx]], or tailbone, is the remnant of a lost [[tail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Spectrum of human tails: A report of six cases |author=Biswanath Mukhopadhyay, Ram M.

Kay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tailbone, located at the end of the spine, has lost its original function in assisting balance and mobility, though it still serves some secondary functions, such as being an attachment point for muscles, which explains why it has not degraded further.  The coccyx serves as an attachment site for tendons, ligaments, and muscles. It also functions as an insertion point of some of the muscles of the pelvic floor.
In rare cases, congenital defect results in a [[Tail#Human tails|short tail-like structure]] being present at birth. Twenty-three cases of human babies born with such a structure have been reported in the medical literature since 1884.&lt;ref name=Dao&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0046-8177(84)80079-9 |pmid=6373560 |title=Human tails and pseudotails |journal=Human Pathology |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=449–53 |year=1984 |last1=Dao |first1=Anh H. |last2=Netsky |first2=Martin G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000637-198804000-00009 |pmid=3284435 |title=Detailing the Human Tail |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=340–4 |year=1988 |last1=Dubrow |first1=Terry J. |last2=Wackym |first2=Phillip Ashley |last3=Lesavoy |first3=Malcolm A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases such as these, the spine and skull were determined to be entirely normal.

=== Wisdom teeth ===
&lt;!--This section also appears in the wisdom teeth article, please try to keep the two in harmony--&gt;
[[Wisdom tooth|Wisdom teeth]] are vestigial third molars that human ancestors used to help in grinding down plant tissue. The common postulation is that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth, which were possibly used to help chew down foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the [[cellulose]] that makes up a plant cell wall. As human diets changed, smaller jaws were [[Natural Selection|naturally selected]], yet the third molars, or "wisdom teeth", still commonly develop in human mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dr. George B.

=== Vomeronasal organ ===
In some animals, the [[vomeronasal organ]] (VNO) is part of a second, completely separate sense of smell, known as the [[Olfaction|accessory olfactory system]]. Many studies have been performed to find if there is an actual presence of a VNO in adult human beings. Trotier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.369 |pmid=10944499 |title=The Vomeronasal Cavity in Adult Humans |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=369–80 |year=2000 |last1=Trotier |first1=D. |last2=Eloit |first2=C |last3=Wassef |first3=M |last4=Talmain |first4=G |last5=Bensimon |first5=J.

The [[ear]]s of a [[macaque]] monkey and most other monkeys have far more developed muscles than those of humans, and therefore have the capability to move their ears to better hear potential threats.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. A. Macalister, Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii., 1871, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other primates such as the [[orangutan]] and [[chimpanzee]] however have ear [[muscle]]s that are minimally developed and non-functional, yet still large enough to be identifiable.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; A muscle attached to the ear that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, can no longer be said to have any biological function.

The outer structure of the ear also shows some vestigial features, such as the node or point on the helix of the ear known as [[Darwin's tubercle]] which is found in around 10% of the population.

=== Eye ===
The [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|plica semilunaris]] is a small fold of tissue on the inside corner of the eye. It is the vestigial remnant of the [[nictitating membrane]], an organ that is fully functional in some other species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Owen|Owen, R.]] 1866–1868. ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates''.

The [[orbitalis muscle]] is a vestigial or rudimentary nonstriated muscle (smooth muscle) of the eye that crosses from the infraorbital groove and sphenomaxillary fissure and is intimately united with the periosteum of the orbit. It was described by Johannes Peter Müller and is often called Müller's muscle. The muscle forms an important part of the lateral orbital wall in some animals, but in humans it is not known to have any significant function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=653491 |year=1978 |author1=Toerien |first1=M.

=== Reproductive system ===
{{Main|List of homologues of the human reproductive system}}

==== Genitalia ====
In the [[internal genitalia]] of each human sex, there are some residual organs of [[mesonephric duct|mesonephric]] and [[paramesonephric duct|paramesonephric]] ducts during embryonic development:
* [[Gartner's duct]]
* [[Epoophoron]]
* [[Vesicular appendages of epoophoron]]
* [[Paroophoron]]

Human vestigial structures also include leftover embryological remnants that once served a function during development, such as the belly button, and analogous structures between biological sexes. For example, men are also born with two nipples, which are not known to serve a function compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;"Breast Anatomy and Embryology." Essentials of Plastic Surgery (2015): 355-61&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to genitourinary development, both internal and external genitalia of male and female fetuses have the ability to fully or partially form their analogous [[phenotype]] of the opposite biological sex if exposed to a lack/overabundance of androgens or the SRY gene during fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(06)80172-1 |pmid=7965425 |title=True hermaphroditism: Genetic variants and clinical management |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=738–44 |year=1994 |last1=Hadjiathanasiou |first1=C.G. |last2=Brauner |first2=R. |last3=Lortat-Jacob |first3=S. |last4=Nivot |first4=S. |last5=Jaubert |first5=F. |last6=Fellous |first6=M. |last7=Nihoul-Fékété |first7=C. |last8=Rappaport |first8=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4274/jcrpe.2495 |pmid=26761946 |pmc=5096479 |title=Homozygous Ala65Pro Mutation with V89L Polymorphism in SRD5A2 Deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=218–23 |year=2016 |last1=Eren |first1=Erdal |last2=Edgünlü |first2=Tuba |last3=Asut |first3=Emre |last4=Karakaş Çelik |first4=Sevim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vestigial remnants of genitourinary development include the [[hymen]], which is a [[membrane]] that surrounds or partially covers the external [[vagina]]l opening that derives from the sinus tubercle during fetal development and is homologous to the male [[seminal colliculus]].&lt;ref name=Healey2010&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/174_2010_128 |chapter=Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract |title=Imaging of Gynecological Disorders in Infants and Children |pages=21–30 |series=Medical Radiology |year=2010 |last1=Healey |first1=Andrew |isbn=978-3-540-85601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers{{who|date=January 2013}} have hypothesized that the persistence of the hymen may be to provide temporary protection from [[infection]], as it separates the vaginal lumen from the urogenital sinus cavity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2008.03.009 |pmid=19646660 |title=Hymen Sparing Surgery for Imperforate Hymen: Case Reports and Review of Literature |journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=e61–4 |year=2009 |last1=Basaran |first1=Mustafa |last2=Usal |first2=Deniz |last3=Aydemir |first3=Cumhur }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the [[glans penis]] and the [[clitoris]], the [[labia minora]] and the ventral penis, and the ovarian follicles and the seminiferous tubules.&lt;ref name=Healey2010/&gt;

He wrote, “It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial structure devoid of function... However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden clothes or napkin.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the physical act of sex, the foreskin reduces friction, which can reduce the need for additional sources of lubrication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Some medical researchers, however, claim [[Circumcision|circumcised]] men enjoy sex just fine and that, in view of recent research on HIV transmission, the foreskin causes more trouble than it’s worth."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The area of the outer forskin measures between 7–100 cm2,&lt;ref&gt;Kigozi G, Wawer M, Ssettuba A, et al. .

The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. London, UK: John Murray; 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2017 publication of the Global Health Journal: Science and Practice, Morris and Krieger wrote, "The variability in foreskin size is consistent with the foreskin being a vestigial structure."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morris BJ, Krieger JN, Klausner JD|date=March 2017|title=CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure|url=http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15|journal=Global Health, Science and Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=15–27|doi=10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00390|pmc=5478224|pmid=28351877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin speculated that the sensitivity of the foreskin to fine touch might have served as an “early warning system” in our naked ancestors while it protected the glans from the intrusion of biting insects and parasites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Musculature ===
A number of [[muscles]] in the human body are thought to be vestigial, either by virtue of being greatly reduced in size compared to homologous muscles in other species, by having become principally tendonous, or by being highly variable in their frequency within or between populations.

==== Head ====
The Occipitalis Minor is a muscle in the back of the head which normally joins to the [[auricular muscles]] of the ear. This muscle is very sporadic in frequency—always present in Malays, in 56% of Africans, 50% of Japanese, 36% of Europeans, and is nonexistent in the [[Khoikhoi]] people of southwestern Africa and in [[Melanesia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30079154 |first1=Alexander |last1=Macalister |year=1875 | title =Additional Observations on Muscular Anomalies in Human Anatomy. (Third Series) With a Catalogue of the Principal Muscular Variations Hitherto Published |journal=The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy |volume=25 |pages=1–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other small muscles in the head associated with the occipital region and the post-auricular muscle complex are often variable in their frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archfaci.6.5.342 |pmid=15381582 |title=Variability of the Postauricular Muscle Complex |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=342–7 |year=2004 |last1=Guerra |first1=Aldo Benjamin |last2=Metzinger |first2=Stephen Eric |last3=Metzinger |first3=Rebecca Crawford |last4=Xie |first4=Chen |last5=Xie |first5=Yue |last6=Rigby |first6=Peter Lister |last7=Naugle |first7=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platysma, a quadrangular (four sides) muscle in a sheet-like configuration, is a vestigial remnant of the panniculous carnosus of animals. In horses, it is the muscle that allows it to flick a fly off its back.

==== Face ====
In many non-human mammals, the upper lip and sinus area is associated with [[whiskers]] or vibrissae which serve a sensory function. In humans, these whiskers do not exist but there are still sporadic cases where elements of the associated vibrissal capsular muscles or sinus hair muscles can be found. Based on histological studies of the upper lips of 20 cadavers, Tamatsu et al. found that structures resembling such muscles were present in 35% (7/20) of their specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20497 |pmid=17458869 |title=Vestiges of vibrissal capsular muscles exist in the human upper lip |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=628–31 |year=2007 |last1=Tamatsu |first1=Yuichi |last2=Tsukahara |first2=Kazue |last3=Hotta |first3=Mitsuyuki |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arm ====
The [[palmaris longus muscle]] is seen as a small tendon between the [[flexor carpi radialis]] and the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]], although it is not always present. The muscle is absent in about 14% of the population, however this varies greatly with ethnicity. It is believed that this muscle actively participated in the arboreal locomotion of primates, but currently has no function, because it does not provide more grip strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/178906 |pmid=24860810 |pmc=4016873 |title=Morphometric and Statistical Analysis of the Palmaris Longus Muscle in Human and Non-Human Primates |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1-6 |year=2014 |last1=Aversi-Ferreira |first1=Roqueline A.

The [[levator claviculae muscle]] in the [[posterior triangle of the neck]] is a supernumerary muscle present in only 2–3% of all people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1999 |ref=harv |last=Rubinstein |first= David |last2=Escott |first2=Edward J. |last3=Hendrick |first3=Laura L. |title=The prevalence and CT appearance of the levator claviculae muscle: a normal variant not to be mistaken for an abnormality |journal= AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=583–6 |pmid=10319965 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/reprint/20/4/583.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nearly always present in most mammalian species, including [[gibbon]]s and [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loukas |first=M. |last2=Sullivan |first2=A. |last3=Tubbs |first3=R.S. |last4=Shoja |first4=M.M. |title=Levator claviculae: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Folia Morphol. |year=2008 |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=307–310 |url=http://www.fm.viamedica.pl/zamow_art_pdf.phtml?id=46&amp;indeks_art=781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Torso ====
The [[pyramidalis muscle]] of the abdomen is a small and triangular muscle, anterior to the [[rectus abdominis]], and contained in the [[rectus sheath]]. It is absent in 20% of humans and when absent, the lower end of the rectus then becomes proportionately increased in size. Anatomical studies suggest that the forces generated by the pyramidalis muscles are relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1447-073X.2007.00226.x |pmid=19159363 |pmc=3531545 |title=Architecture and fiber type of the pyramidalis muscle |journal=Anatomical Science International |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=294–7 |year=2008 |last1=Lovering |first1=Richard M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Larry D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] of the back has several sporadic [[Latissimus dorsi muscle#Variations|variations]]. One particular variant is the existence of the dorsoepitrochlearis or latissimocondyloideus muscle which is a muscle passing from the tendon of the latissimus dorsi to the long head of the [[triceps brachii]]. It is notable due to its well developed character in other apes and monkeys, where it is an important climbing muscle, namely the dorsoepitrochlearis brachii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20799 |pmid=19373904 |title=Development and clinical significance of the musculus dorsoepitrochlearis in men |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=481–8 |year=2009 |last1=P. |first1=Haninec |last2=R. |first2=Tomáš |last3=R. |first3=Kaiser |last4=R. |first4=Čihák }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, William E., ''The Musculoskeletal Anatomy of the Thorax and Brachium of an Adult Female Chimpanzee'',6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory, New Mexico, 1965. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/462433.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This muscle is found in ≈5% of humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/MuscularSystem/Text/L/06Latissimus.shtml{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leg ====
The [[plantaris muscle]] is composed of a thin muscle belly and a long thin tendon. The muscle belly is approximately {{convert|5|-|10|cm|inch|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} long, and is absent in 7–10% of the human population. It has some weak functionality in moving the knee and ankle but is generally considered redundant and is often used as a source of tendon for grafts. The long, thin tendon of the plantaris is humorously called "the freshman's nerve", as it is often mistaken for a nerve by first-year medical students.

==== Tongue ====
Another intriguing example of human vestigiality occurs in the tongue, specifically the chondroglossus muscle.  In a morphological study of 100 Japanese cadavers, it was found that 86% of fibers identified were solid and bundled in the appropriate way to facilitate speech and mastication.  The other 14% of fibers were short, thin and sparse – nearly useless, and thus concluded to be of vestigial origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(02)80087-5 |pmid=12392330 |title=Morphological study of the human chondroglossus muscle in Japanese |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger |volume=184 |issue=5 |pages=493–9 |year=2002 |last1=Ogata |first1=Shigemitsu |last2=Mine |first2=Kazuharu |last3=Tamatsu |first3=Yuichi |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breasts ===
[[Supernumerary nipple|Extra nipples]] or [[Accessory breast|breasts]] sometimes appear along the [[Milk line|mammary lines]] of humans, appearing as a remnant to mammalian ancestors who possessed more than two nipples or breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kajava | first1 = Y | year = 1915 | title = The proportions of supernumerary nipples in the Finnish population | url = | journal = Duodecim | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 143–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0971-6866.108051 |pmid=23716953 |pmc=3656534 |title=Seven nipples in a male: World′s second case report |journal=Indian Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=373–5 |year=2012 |last1=Goyal |first1=Tarang |last2=Bakshi |first2=SK |last3=Varshney |first3=Anupam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ==
[[File:Gaensehaut.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Goose bumps]] are an example of a vestigial human reaction to stress.]]
Humans also bear some vestigial behaviors and reflexes.&lt;ref name=Spinney&gt;{{Citation|title=Remnants of evolution |author=Laura Spinney |journal=New Scientist |year=2008 |volume=198 |issue=2656 |pages=42–45 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the formation of [[goose bumps]] in humans under [[stress (medicine)|stress]] is a vestigial [[reflex action|reflex]]; a possible function in human evolutionary ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. (1872) ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' John Murray, London.{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Raising the hair is also used to trap an extra layer of air, keeping an animal warm.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Due to the diminished amount of hair in humans, the reflex formation of goose bumps when cold is also vestigial.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt;

The [[palmar grasp reflex]] is supported to be a vestigial behavior in human infants. When placing a finger or object to the palm of an infant, it will securely grasp it. This grasp is found to be rather strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |edition=fifth |author=Peter Gray |year=2007 |page=66 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-0617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[infant]]s—37% according to a 1932 study—are able to support their own weight from a rod,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzL2Bgvf9Q0C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22chancy+and+mcgraw+(31)+investigated+the+reflex+in+the+125+infants%22%22 Behavior Development in Infants] (via Google Books) by Evelyn Dewey, citing a study "Reflexes and other motor activities in newborn infants: a report of 125 cases as a preliminary study of infant behavior" published in the ''Bull. Neurol. Inst. New York'', 1932, Vol. 2, pp. 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;, although there is no way they can cling to their mother. The grasp is also evident in the feet too. When a baby is sitting down, its prehensile feet assume a curled-in posture, similar to that observed in an adult chimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |pages=85–86 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archetype: A Natural History of the Self |author=Anthony Stevens |year=1982 |page=87 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7100-0980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancestral primate would have had sufficient body hair to which an infant could cling unlike modern humans, thus allowing its mother to escape from danger, such as climbing up a tree in the presence of a predator without having to occupy her hands holding her baby.

It has been proposed that the [[hiccup]] is an evolutionary remnant of earlier [[amphibian]] [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.10224 |pmid=12539245 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for the origin of hiccough |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |year=2003 |last1=Straus |first1=C. |last2=Vasilakos |first2=K. |last3=Wilson |first3=R. J. A. |last4=Oshima |first4=T. |last5=Zelter |first5=M. |last6=Derenne |first6=J-Ph. |last7=Similowski |first7=T. |last8=Whitelaw |first8=W. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibians such as tadpoles gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to mammalian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during fetal development, before the motor pathways that enable normal lung ventilation form. Thus, according to recapitulation theory, the hiccup is evolutionarily antecedent to modern lung respiration. Additionally, they point out that hiccups and amphibian gulping are inhibited by elevated CO{{Sub2}} and may be stopped by [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] agonists, illustrating a possible shared physiology and evolutionary heritage. These proposals may explain why premature infants spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping, possibly gulping like amphibians, as their lungs are not yet fully formed. Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs before 28 weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the [[phrenic nerve]], which primarily controls the thoracic diaphragm. The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation, it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held-over from our amphibious ancestors.
This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for most of this paragraph. Also, what is the second type of fetal intrauterine hiccups?|date=May 2015}}

== Molecular ==
{{further|Pseudogene}}
There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], a gene that is functional in most other mammals and produces an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes [[vitamin C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-4165(99)00123-3 |pmid=10572964 |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |volume=1472 |issue=1–2 |pages=408–11 |year=1999 |last1=Ohta |first1=Yuriko |last2=Nishikimi |first2=Morimitsu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and other members of the suborder [[Haplorrhini]], a mutation disabled the gene and made it unable to produce the enzyme. However, the remains of the gene are still present in the [[human genome]] as a vestigial genetic sequence called a [[pseudogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishikimi M, Fukuyama R, Minoshima S, Shimizu N, Yagi K |title=Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the human nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in man |journal=J.

'''Hyperthecosis''' (or ovarian hyperthecosis) is [[hyperplasia]] of the [[theca interna]] of the [[ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 21st Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperthecosis occurs when an area of luteinization occurs along with stromal hyperplasia. The luteinized cells produce [[androgens]], which may lead to [[hirsutism]] and [[virilization]] (or masculinization) in affected women.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, Stead, Kaufman, Suarez (2009). First Aid for the Obstretrics &amp; Gynecology Clerkship - Second Edition. McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hyperthecosis refers to the presence of nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma due to differentiation of the ovarian interstitial cells into steroidogenically active luteinized stromal cells. These nests or islands of luteinized theca cells are scattered throughout the stroma of the ovary, rather than being confined to areas around cystic follicles as in [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)]]. These luteinized theca cells result in greater production of androgens.

Seen as a severe form of PCOS, the clinical features of hyperthecosis are similar to those of PCOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Cunxian|last2=Sung|first2=C. James|last3=Quddus|first3=M.

The etiology of hyperthecosis is unknown, however evidence suggests a possibility of genetic transmission. Hyperthecosis has been documented in familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21998336_Hyperthecosis_an_inheritable_form_of_polycystic_ovarian_disease|title=Hyperthecosis: an inheritable form of polycystic ovarian disease|last=Wilroy|first=R.S.|date=February 1975|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insulin resistance]] may also play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperthecosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11886">The '''insulin index''' of a food represents how much it elevates the concentration of [[insulin]] in the blood during the two-hour period after the food is ingested. The index is similar to the [[glycemic index]] (GI) and [[glycemic load]] (GL), but rather than relying on [[blood glucose]] levels, the Insulin Index is based upon blood insulin levels. The Insulin Index represents a comparison of food portions with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ), while GI represents a comparison of portions with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g) and the GL represents portions of a typical serving size for various foods. The Insulin Index can be more useful than either the glycemic index or the glycemic load because certain foods (e.g., lean meats and proteins) cause an insulin response despite there being no [[carbohydrate]]s present, and some foods cause a disproportionate insulin response relative to their carbohydrate load.

Holt et al.&lt;ref name=Holt1997/&gt; have noted that the glucose and insulin scores of most foods are highly correlated,&lt;ref name="Cure for Diabetes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gabriel |last=Cousens |title=There Is a Cure for Diabetes: The Tree of Life 21-Day+ Program |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aTatu9P_XwC&amp;pg=PT144 |year=2008 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-55643-691-8 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; but high-protein foods and bakery products that are rich in fat and refined carbohydrates "elicit insulin responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic responses." They also conclude that insulin indices may be useful for dietary management and avoidance of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

==Explanation of Index==
The Insulin Index is not the same as a glycemic index (GI), which is based exclusively on the digestible carbohydrate content of a food, and represents a comparison of foods in amounts with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g). The insulin index compares foods in amounts with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ). Insulin indexes are scaled relative to white bread, while glycemic index scores nowadays are usually scaled with respect to pure glucose, although in the past white bread has been a reference point for GI measurements as well.
In the chart below, glycemic and insulin scores show the increase in the blood concentration of each. A higher [[satiety]] score indicates how much less was eaten from a buffet after participants ate the listed food.

Glucose (glycemic) and insulin scores were determined by feeding 1000 kilojoules (239 kilocalories) of the food to the participants and recording the area under the glucose/insulin curve for 120 minutes then dividing by the area under the glucose/insulin curve for white bread.  The result being that all scores are relative to [[white bread]]. The satiety score was determined by comparing how satiated participants felt within two hours after being fed a fixed number of calories (240 kilocalories) of a particular food while blindfolded (to ensure food appearance was not a factor), then dividing that number by how satiated the participants felt after eating white bread.
White bread serves as the baseline of 100. In other words, foods scoring higher than 100 are more satisfying than white bread and those under 100 are less satisfying. The satiety score was negatively correlated to the amount eaten by participants at a subsequent buffet.

± indicate uncertainty in the data.  For example 60 ± 12 means that there's a 95% chance the score is between 60-12 (48) and 60+12 (72), 60 being the highest probability assuming a bell curve.  In practice this means that if two foods have large uncertainty and have values close together then you don't really know which score is the higher.

The '''''Journal of Religion and Film''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that "examines the description, critique, and embodiment of [[religion]] in film". The [[editor-in-chief]] is John C. Lyden ([[Grand View University]]). It was established in 1997 by William L. Blizek and [[Ronald Burke (theologian)|Ronald Burke]] ([[University of Nebraska at Omaha]]), who became interested in the subject of religion and film after hearing [[Andrew Greeley]] speak about images of God in popular movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Edit1.1.htm |title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Vol 1, No. 1 Editorial |publisher=Unomaha.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14524">In mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]], the '''linear complementarity problem (LCP)''' arises frequently in [[computational mechanics]] and encompasses the well-known [[quadratic programming]] as a special case.  It was proposed by Cottle and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]] {{nowrap|in&amp;nbsp;1968.&lt;ref name="Murty88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Cottle and [[G. B. Dantzig]]. Complementary pivot theory of mathematical programming. ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'', 1:103-125, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Formulation ==
Given a real matrix ''M'' and vector ''q'', the linear complementarity problem LCP(''M'', ''q'') seeks vectors ''z'' and ''w'' which satisfy the following constraints:

* &lt;math&gt;w, z \geqslant 0,&lt;/math&gt; (that is, each component of these two vectors is non-negative)
* &lt;math&gt;z^Tw = 0&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_i w_i z_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt; This is the [[Complementarity theory|complementarity]] condition, since it implies that, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, at most one of &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; can be positive.
* &lt;math&gt;w = Mz + q&lt;/math&gt;

A sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem is that ''M'' be [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[Q-matrix]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a unique solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[P-matrix]]. Both of these characterizations are sufficient and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murty|first1=Katta G.|title=On the number of solutions to the complementarity problem and spanning properties of complementary cones|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|date=January 1972|volume=5|issue=1|pages=65–108|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(72)90019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vector ''w'' is a [[slack variable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Convex Optimization of Power Systems|first=Joshua Adam|last=Taylor|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015| isbn=9781107076877|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBdoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and so is generally discarded after ''z'' is found. As such, the problem can also be formulated as:

* &lt;math&gt;Mz+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z^{\mathrm{T}}(Mz+q) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (the complementarity condition)

==Convex quadratic-minimization: Minimum conditions==
Finding a solution to the linear complementarity problem is associated with minimizing the quadratic function

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^T(Mz+q)&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the constraints

: &lt;math&gt;{Mz}+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;

These constraints ensure that ''f'' is always non-negative. The minimum of ''f'' is 0 at ''z'' if and only if ''z'' solves the linear complementarity problem.

If ''M'' is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], any algorithm for solving (strictly) convex [[Quadratic programming|QPs]] can solve the LCP.  Specially designed basis-exchange pivoting algorithms, such as [[Lemke's algorithm]] and a variant of the [[simplex algorithm|simplex algorithm of Dantzig]] have been used for decades. Besides having polynomial time complexity, interior-point methods are also effective in practice.

Also, a quadratic-programming problem stated as minimize &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c^Tx+\tfrac{1}{2} x^T Qx&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;Ax \geqslant b&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;x \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; with ''Q'' symmetric

is the same as solving the LCP with

:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ -b \end{bmatrix}, \qquad M = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; -A^T \\ A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker]] conditions of the QP problem can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} 
v = Q x - A^T {\lambda} + c \\ 
s = A x - b \\ 
x, {\lambda}, v, s \geqslant 0 \\ 
x^{T} v+ {\lambda}^T s = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''v'' the Lagrange multipliers on the non-negativity constraints, ''λ'' the &lt;!-- Lagrange  --&gt;multipliers on the inequality constraints, and ''s'' the slack variables for the inequality constraints. The fourth condition derives from the complementarity of each group of variables {{math|(''x'', ''s'')}} with its set of KKT vectors (optimal Lagrange multipliers) being {{math|(''v'', ''λ'')}}. In that case,

: &lt;math&gt;z = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \lambda \end{bmatrix}, \qquad w = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ s \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the non-negativity constraint on the ''x'' is relaxed, the dimensionality of the LCP problem can be reduced to the number of the inequalities, as long as ''Q'' is non-singular (which is guaranteed if it is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]). The multipliers ''v'' are no longer present, and the first KKT conditions can be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;Q x = A^{T} {\lambda} - c&lt;/math&gt;

or:

: &lt;math&gt; x = Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c)&lt;/math&gt;

pre-multiplying the two sides by ''A'' and subtracting ''b'' we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt; A x - b = A Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c) -b \,&lt;/math&gt;

The left side, due to the second KKT condition, is ''s''. Substituting and reordering:

: &lt;math&gt; s = (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) {\lambda} + (- A Q^{-1} c - b )\,&lt;/math&gt;

Calling now

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) \\
Q &amp;:=  (- A Q^{-1} c - b)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

we have an LCP, due to the relation of complementarity between the slack variables ''s'' and their Lagrange multipliers ''λ''. Once we solve it, we may obtain the value of ''x'' from ''λ''  through the first KKT condition.

Finally, it is also possible to handle additional equality constraints:

: &lt;math&gt;A_{eq}x = b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;

This introduces a vector of Lagrange multipliers ''μ'', with the same dimension as &lt;math&gt;b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to verify that the ''M'' and ''Q'' for the LCP system &lt;math&gt; s = M {\lambda} + Q&lt;/math&gt; are now expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}  \begin{bmatrix} A^T \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  \\
Q &amp;:= - \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ b_{eq} \end{bmatrix} - b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From ''λ'' we can now recover the values of both ''x'' and the Lagrange multiplier of equalities ''μ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ \mu \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} A^T \lambda - c \\ -b_{eq} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, most QP solvers work on the LCP formulation, including the [[interior point method]], principal / complementarity pivoting, and [[active set]] methods.&lt;ref name="Murty88"&gt;{{harvtxt|Murty|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"&gt;{{harvtxt|Cottle|Pang|Stone|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCP problems can be solved also by the [[criss-cross algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Terlaky|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRT"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D. |last1=den&amp;nbsp;Hertog |first2=C.| last2=Roos |first3=T. |last3=Terlaky|title=The linear complementarity problem, sufficient matrices, and the criss-cross method|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|volume=187|date=1 July 1993|pages=1–14|url=http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6714737.pdf|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(93)90124-7|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zsolt |last1=Csizmadia |first2=Tibor |last2=Illés|title=New criss-cross type algorithms for linear complementarity problems with sufficient matrices|journal=Optimization Methods and Software| volume=21 |year=2006 |number=2 |pages=247–266|doi=10.1080/10556780500095009|url=http://www.cs.elte.hu/opres/orr/download/ORR03_1.pdf|format=pdf|&lt;!-- ref=harv --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, for linear complementarity problems, the criss-cross algorithm terminates finitely only if the matrix is a sufficient matrix.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt; A [[sufficient&amp;nbsp;matrix]] is a generalization both of a [[positive-definite matrix]] and of a [[P-matrix]], whose [[principal&amp;nbsp;minor]]s are each positive.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cottle | first1=R.&amp;nbsp;W. |authorlink1=Richard W.

In [[natural language processing]], [[linguistics]], and neighboring fields, '''Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)''' describes a method and an interdisciplinary community concerned with creating, sharing and (re-)using language resources in accordance with [[Linked Data]] principles. The '''Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud''' was conceived and is maintained by the [http://linguistics.okfn.org/  Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG)] of the [[Open Knowledge|Open Knowledge Foundation]], but has been a point of focal activity for several [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] community groups, research projects and infrastructure efforts since then.

== Linguistic Linked Open Data ==
[[File:LLOD-Cloud-2016-05-24.png|thumb|LLOD Cloud (2016-05-24)]]
Linguistic Linked Open Data is a movement about publishing data for linguistics and natural language processing using the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Open Linguistics Working Group|title=Linguistic LOD|url=http://linguistic-lod.org/|website=linguistic-lod.org|publisher=LIDER project|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Data should be openly licensed using licenses such as the [[Creative Commons]] licenses.
* The elements in a dataset should be uniquely identified by means of a [[URI]].
* The URI should resolve, so users can access more information using web browsers.
* Resolving an LLOD resource should return results using [[web standards]] such as [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF).
* [[Hyperlink|Links]] to other resources should be included to help users discover new resources and provide semantics.

The primary benefits of LLOD have been identified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiarcos|first1=Christian|last2=McCrae|first2=John|last3=Cimiano|first3=Philipp|last4=Fellbaum|first4=Christiane|title=Towards open data for linguistics: Lexical Linked Data|date=2013|publisher=In: Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.), New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources. Springer|location=Heidelberg|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642317811-c1.pdf|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Representation: [[Linked graph]]s are a more flexible representation format for linguistic data.
* Interoperability: Common RDF models can easily be integrated.
* Federation: Data from multiple sources can trivially be combined.
* Ecosystem: Tools for RDF and linked data are widely available under open source licenses.
* Expressivity: Existing vocabularies help express linguistic resources.
* Semantics: Common links express what you mean.
* Dynamicity: Web data can be continuously improved.

=== Uses of LLOD ===
Linguistic Linked Open Data was applied to address a number of scientific research problems: 
* In all areas of empirical linguistics, [[computational philology]] and [[natural language processing]], linguistic annotation and linguistic markup represent central elements of analysis. However, progress in this field is being hampered by [[Interoperability|interoperability challenges]], most notably differences in vocabularies and annotation schemes used for different resources and tools. Using Linked Data to connect language resources and ontologies/terminology repositories facilitates re-using shared vocabularies and interpreting them against a common basis.
* In [[corpus linguistics]] and computational philology, [[overlapping markup]] represents a notorious problem to conventional [[XML]] formats. Hence, graph-based data models have been suggested since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Steven|last2=Liberman|first2=Mark|title=Towards a formal framework for linguistic annotations|url=http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sb/home/papers/icslp98.pdf|publisher=In:  Proceedings of the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, Sydney, 1998|accessdate=2016-05-25}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally represented by means of multiple, interlinked XML files (standoff XML),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ISO 24612:2012|title=Language resource management -- Linguistic annotation framework (LAF)|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37326|publisher=ISO|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are poorly supported by off-the-shelf XML technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckart|first1=Richard|title=Choosing an XML database for linguistically annotated corpora|date=2008|publisher=SDV.

Linked Data in Linguistics. Representing and Connecting Language Data and Language Metadata, 2012|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eliminates the need for special-purpose technology, and, instead, relies on the existing RDF ecosystem.
* Multilingual issues including the linking of lexical resources such as [[WordNet]] as performed in the [https://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/ Interlingual Index] of the [[Global WordNet Association]] and interconnecting heterogeneous resources such as WordNet and Wikipedia, as was done in [[BabelNet]].
* Providing forums for standardization of linguistic resource information

=== Selected LLOD resources ===

In October 2018, the 10 most frequently linked resources in the LLOD diagram are (in order of the number of linked datasets):

* The [http://purl.org/olia/ Ontologies of Linguistic Annotation] (OLiA, linked with 74 datasets) provide reference terminology for linguistic annotations and grammatical metadata;
* [[WordNet]] (linked with 51 datasets), a lexical database for English and pivot for developing similar databases for other languages, with several editions (Princeton edition linked with 36 datasets; W3C edition linked with 8 datasets; VU edition linked with 7 datasets);
* [[DBpedia]] (linked with 50 datasets) multilingual knowledge basis of general world knowledge, based on Wikipedia;
* [https://www.lexinfo.net/ lexinfo.net] (linked with 36 datasets) provides reference terminology for lexical resources;
* [[BabelNet]] (linked with 33 datasets)  multilingual lexicalized semantic network, based on the aggregation of various other resources, most notably WordNet and Wikipedia;
* [http://www.lexvo.org/ lexvo.org] (linked with 26 datasets) provides language identifiers and other language-related data. Most importantly, lexvo provides a RDF representation of [[ISO_639-3]] 3-letter codes for language identifiers and information about these languages;
* The [[ISO_12620]] Data Category Registry (ISOcat; RDF edition, linked with 10 datasets) provides a semistructured repository for various language-related terminology. ISOcat is hosted by The Language Archive, respectively, the [[DOBES]] project, at the [[Max_Planck_Institute_for_Psycholinguistics]], but currently in transition to [[CLARIN]];
* [[UBY]] (RDF edition &lt;i&gt;lemon-Uby&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 9 datasets), a lexical network for English, aggregated from various lexical resources;
* [[Glottolog]] (linked with 7 datasets) provides fine-grained language identifiers for low-resource languages, in particular many not covered by lexvo.org;
* [[Wiktionary]]-[[DBpedia]] links (&lt;i&gt;wiktionary.dbpedia.org&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 7 datasets), Wiktionary-based lexicalizations for DBpedia concepts.

=== LLOD cloud development and community activities ===
The LLOD cloud diagram is maintained by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) of the Open Knowledge Foundation (since 2014 Open Knowledge), an open and interdisciplinary of experts in language resources.

The OWLG organizes community events and coordinates LLOD developments and facilitates interdisciplinary communication between and among LLOD contributors and users.

Several W3C Business and Community Groups focus on specialized aspects of LLOD:
* The W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group develops and maintains specifications for machine-readable dictionaries in the LLOD cloud
* The W3C Best Practices for Multilingual Linked Open Data Community Group gathers information on best practises for producing multilingual linked open data.
* The W3C Linked Data for Language Technology Community Group assembles user cases and requirements for language technology applications that use Linked Data.

LLOD development is driven forward by and documented in series of international workshops, datathons, and associated publications. Among others, these include
* Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL), annual scientific workshop, since 2012
* Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE), bi-annual community meeting (2012 and 2014)
* Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD), bi-annual datathon, since 2015

Uses and development of LLOD have been subject to several research projects, including

In [[law]], a '''merism''' is a [[figure of speech]] by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts or lists several synonyms for the same thing.

In [[rhetoric]], a merism is the combination of two contrasting words to refer to an entirety.&lt;ref name="Waltke2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce K Waltke|title=A commentary on Micah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6JM1WpP2NoC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=19 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=Wm.

The title of the [[tabletop role-playing game]] [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] is also a merism and refers to its [[fantasy]] theme. Another example of a merism is the [[sword-and-sandal]] movie genre, a loose term for movies made until 1970 set in [[Classical antiquity]].

Merisms also figure in a number of familiar [[English language|English]] expressions. The phrase "[[lock, stock, and barrel]]" originally referred to the most conspicuous parts of a [[gun]] and has now come to refer to the whole of anything that has constituent parts.

In [[biology]], a '''merism''' is a repetition of similar parts in the structure of an organism (Bateson 1894). Such features are called [[meristic]] characters, and the study of such characters is called [[meristics]].

Merisms are conspicuous features of [[Biblical poetry]]. For example, in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1, when God creates "the heavens and the earth" ([[King James Version]]), the two parts combined indicate that God created the whole [[universe]]. Similarly, in [[Psalm]] 139, the psalmist declares that God knows "my downsitting and mine uprising" to indicate that God knows all the psalmist's actions. In addition, Genesis 1:5 uses "evening" and "morning" as a merism for "one day".

==Etymology==
The term entered English in 1894 in the biological sense, but had appeared earlier in rhetorical contexts where it denoted "'synecdoche in which totality is expressed by contrasting parts' (such as ''high and low'', ''young and old'')". It derives from Modern Latin ''merismus'', from Greek ''merismos'' 'a dividing or partitioning', ultimately from ''merizein'' 'to divide', from ''meros'' 'part, share'.&lt;ref name="EtymologyOnline"&gt;{{cite web |author=Harper, Douglas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=25 Sep 2015 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=merism&amp;searchmode=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODLT"&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/merism.html |accessdate=25 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal usage==
{{see also|Legal doublet}}

Merisms frequently figure in the writing of [[lawyer]]s, and are a hallmark of legal style.  The two parts of the legal merism "[[Will (law)|Last Will and Testament]]" at one time referred to two documents, enforced in two separate [[court]]s: the ''will'' disposed of a decedent's [[real property]] while the ''testament'' disposed of [[Personal property|chattel]]s.  It became customary to combine the instruments in a single dispositive document, and the name has continued long after the doctrines that required its use became obsolete in [[common law]].

A lawyer who writes a will typically includes a residuary clause that disposes of any property not covered by a prior section.  The weight of tradition is such that the lawyer writing such a document will often phrase it something like this:

{{quote|I bequeath, convey, and devise the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, whether real or personal, and wheresoever it may be situated, to...}}

Traditionally, a gift of real property was called a "devise" whereas a gift of other property was a "bequest". Nowadays, the words "bequeath" and "devise" are synonymous in most jurisdictions so that "I bequeath the rest of my property to ..." is enough in both law and logic to achieve the same result.  The entire phrase is an elaborate merism.  Many [[deed]]s frequently contain a traditional clause that says that the grantee is "to have and to hold" the property conveyed; this usage goes back to the days in which the instruments were drawn up in [[Latin]], and is sometimes called a "habendam et tenendam" clause.  The use of legal merisms seldom if ever adds legal effect to the document that contains them, and frequently increases their reading difficulty.  However, the weight of tradition and the fear that a deviation from the established formula might have unintended legal consequences makes lawyers reluctant to revise the traditional formulae, and their clients, seeing them, at least draw the satisfaction of knowing that their documents appear to be written by a lawyer.

In some cases, the doubling, or even tripling, of constituent parts in these meristic constructions arose as a result of the transition of legal discourse from Latin to French, and then from French to English. During such periods, in an attempt to prevent ambiguity and ensure hermeneutic consistency, key terms were paired with synonyms from multiple languages.&lt;ref name="Espenschied 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Espenschied, Lenné Eidson |title=Contract Drafting: Powerful Prose in Transactional Practice |publisher=American Bar Association |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164–65}}

According to the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bradd Shore]], the '''''neuromantic'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Culture in Mind: Cognition, Culture, and the Problem of Meaning|url=|volume=|pages=141, 143–4|year=1996|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=|isbn=|id=|authorlink=Bradd Shore|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the cybernetic frame of mind among excited computer enthusiasts as they experience what Michael Heim called "the all-at-once simultaneity of totalizing presentness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Nucleocosmochronology''' or '''nuclear cosmochronology''' is a technique used to determine timescales for [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] objects and events. It compares the observed ratios of [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of heavy [[radionuclide|radioactive]] and [[stable nuclide]]s to the primordial ratios predicted by [[nucleosynthesis]] theory in order to calculate the age of formation of astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="Bland-Hawthorn Freeman 2014 pp. 1–144"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bland-Hawthorn | first=Joss | last2=Freeman | first2=Kenneth | title=The Origin of the Galaxy and Local Group | chapter=Near Field Cosmology: The Origin of the Galaxy and the Local Group | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | publication-place=Berlin, Heidelberg | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-642-41719-1 | issn=1861-7980 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41720-7_1 | pages=1–144| bibcode=2014SAAS...37....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleocosmochronology has been employed to determine the age of the [[Sun]] ({{val|4.57|0.02}} billion years) and of the Galactic [[thin disk]] ({{val|8.8|1.8}} billion years),&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/?0411698 del Peloso et al., "The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology I.

It has also been used to estimate the age of the [[Milky Way]] itself, as exemplified by a recent study of [[Cayrel's Star]] in the [[Galactic halo]], which due to its low [[metallicity]], is believed to have formed early in the history of the Galaxy.&lt;ref name="Hill Plez Cayrel Beers 2002 pp. 560–579"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hill | first=V. | last2=Plez | first2=B. | last3=Cayrel | first3=R. | last4=Beers | first4=T.

'''Organic feeding disorders''' are created when there are changes in an [[organism]] which directly or indirectly affect the organism's need to survive, or the need for [[nourishment]].  For example, when someone becomes ill, their body is naturally not as [[hunger|hungry]] as it was before.  This can also occur if a person's food intake is reduced; over time they will not want to eat as much and will reduce their efforts towards seeking out nourishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22441">'''Overpopulation in domestic pets''' is the [[Overpopulation (biology)|surplus]] of [[pet]]s, such as [[domestic cat|cat]]s, [[domestic dog|dog]]s, and [[Exotic pet|exotic animal]]s. In the United States, a 6 to 8 million animals are brought to [[Animal shelter|shelters]] each year, of which an estimated 3 to 4 million are subsequently [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], including 2.7 million considered healthy and adoptable.&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt; Euthanasia numbers have declined from the 1970s, when U.S. shelters euthanized an estimated 12 to 20 million animals.&lt;ref name="HSUS criticism"/&gt; Most [[humane society|humane societies]], [[animal shelter]]s and [[rescue group]]s urge animal caregivers to have their animals [[spaying and neutering|spayed or neutered]] to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters that could contribute to this dynamic.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

==Global effects==
Dealing with a population of unwanted domestic animals is a major concern to [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] groups. Domestic animal overpopulation can also be an ecological concern. It is also a financial problem: capturing, impounding and eventual [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] costs taxpayers and private agencies millions of dollars each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/03/prweb3747034.htm |title=New Research Exposes High Taxpayer Cost For ‘Eradicating’ Free-Roaming Cats |publisher=Prweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unwanted pets are also commonly released to the wild, sometimes contributing to severe damage to ecosystems (e.g., the effect of introduction of exotic snakes to Florida's [[Everglades]]).

===Bahrain===
In Bahrain the number of stray dogs has been increasing since early 2000s with the situation getting out of hand in late 2010s which caused a lot of controversy regarding the case from people claiming to be bothered and attacked by stray dogs and stray dogs puppies being inhumanely murdered (or burned). On the other hand, since 2014 an act has been put by the Bahrain Society for the Prevention of [[Cruelty to animals|Cruelty to Animals]] (BSPCA) and made a plea to the government to help keep the Catch, Neuter and Return programme (CNVR) running.&lt;ref name="bahrainbspca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.gdnonline.com/NewsDetails.aspx?date=04/07/2015&amp;storyid=359781 |title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=GULF DIGITAL NEWS |date=August 24, 2013 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent attacks on farms also happened, Sheikha Marwa bint Abdulrahman Al Khalifa also contributed to the case and decided to build a shelter (welfare) for the strays to neuter and rehabilitate them to prevent further attacks while also cooperating with the Bahrain stray dogs society group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MISC_281760.html|title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=Trade Arabia |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Canadian Federation of Humane Societies]] (CFHS) has been collecting statistics from Canadian animal shelters since 1993.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} A survey in 2013 included data from 100 of 186 humane societies and [[SPCA]]s.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} However, municipal animal services agencies were not included, hence "the data in this report represents only a fraction of homeless companion animals in Canada."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} In 2012, the surveyed shelters took in just over 188,000 animals, and euthanized 65,423 animals, representing 35% of all intakes.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Six times as many cats were euthanized as dogs, or 41% of cats and 15% of dogs.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The report said a gradually improving trend, but that cats have a far worse outcome than dogs: "More than twice as many cats enter shelters than dogs, and though adoption rates for cats are similar to those for dogs, fewer cats are reclaimed and many more are euthanized."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal911.ca/half-a-million-unwanted-pets-euthanized-in-quebec-in-2013/ In 2013, half a million unwanted pets were euthanized in Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Estimates of animals brought to shelters and of animals subsequently euthanized in the U.S. have issues with their reliability. [[The Humane Society of the United States]] provides shelter statistics with this caution: "There is no central [[data reporting]] system for U.S. animal shelters and rescues. These estimates are based on information provided by the (former) National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy."&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; The HSUS provided numbers of 6 to 8 million animals taken to shelters, 3 to 4 million animals euthanized, and 2.7 million of the euthanized animals being healthy and adoptable, as estimates for 2012-2013,&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; and also for annual figures in an August 2014 article.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

The National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy conducted a survey over four years, 1994-1997, and cautions against the use of their survey for wider estimates: "It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate the numbers of animals entering animal shelters in the United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters."&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; Summary statistics from the survey said that in 1997, 4.3 million animals entered the surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt;

The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] provides alternate numbers, saying that there are about 13,600 community animal shelters in the US.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; "There is no national organization monitoring these shelters", and "no government institution or animal organization is responsible for tabulating national statistics for the animal protection movement."&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; However, national estimates are provided of 7.6 million animals entering shelters each year, with 2.7 million of them euthanized.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt;

The [[American Humane Association]] said the difficulties in estimating numbers, and provides a higher figure, saying that in 2008, an estimated 3.7 million animals were euthanized in shelters.&lt;ref name="AHA euth stats"/&gt;

A 1993 study of US dog populations considered a wider range of sources than animal shelters.&lt;ref name="Article about Patronek study"&gt;[http://www.naiaonline.org/naia-library/articles/are-there-too-many-dogs-and-cats/ "Are there too many dogs and cats?: Pet overpopulation myths and Facts"], Norma Bennett Woolf, National Animal Interest Alliance, March 19, 1997, referring to Gary J. Patronek and Andrew N Rowan, "Determining Dog and Cat Numbers and Population Dynamics", Anthrozoos Vol. 8, No. 4, (1995), pp. 199-205; that article referred to the original 1993 study: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233502996_Development_of_a_Model_for_Estimating_the_Size_and_Dynamics_of_the_Pet_Dog_Population "Development of a Model for Estimating the Size and Dynamics of the Pet Dog Population"], Gary J. Patronek, Anthrozoos, Vol. 12, 1993; No. 7(1), pp. 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that 4 million dogs entered shelters, with 2.4 million (or 60%) euthanized (p.&amp;nbsp;203).&lt;ref name="Patronek 1995"/&gt;

==Reasons for relinquishment==
Unwanted dogs and cats may have been acquired from any source. Large numbers of animals are placed in shelters by pet owners each year for reasons such as moving, allergies, behavioral problems, and lack of time or money, or the pet animal giving birth to young. Another common reason for surrendering a pet is because of milestones, like marriage or the birth of a new baby.&lt;ref name="americanhumane1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/adoption-pet-care/issues-information/pet-overpopulation.html |title=Pet Overpopulation |publisher=Americanhumane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purebred animals==
The [[American Pet Products Association]] says that since purebreds are only 5% to 6% of the US pet cat population, the overpopulation problem is mainly due to mixed or random bred animals, and avoiding purebred cats would make little difference.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) says that 25% of the dogs who enter animal shelters are purebred.{{Relevance inline|reason= This 25% includes lost purebred pets that are subsequently returned to their owners. It doesn't distinguish between purebreds that came from backyard breeders, professional breeders, or puppy mills.

The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) and the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) say the benefits of purebred dogs or cats include that they have been developed over time to show specific traits that are useful for hunting, rescue, assistance and other needs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; Animal buyers, including pet owners, may choose a purebred to ensure they know ahead of time the size and other characteristics a young animal will grow into.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA also says that purebred cats may make better pets because they have a weaker hunting instinct.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The HSUS says that a pedigree is not a guarantee of health and temperament, and that mixed breed dogs and cats often show good characteristics of both breeds, and may be less likely to have genetic defects.&lt;ref name=HSUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

The AKC says [[breeder]]s offer services and information about the animals they sell, such as a detailed pedigree, and expertise in the health and temperament of the breed they specialize in.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says animal shelters may offer animals that have already had necessary veterinary procedures, such as [[spaying]] or [[neutering]], [[vaccination]], [[deworming]], and [[microchipping]].&lt;ref name=HSUS2012/&gt;

The best practices set by the AKC for responsible breeders include screening customers so animals are placed in a good home, and follow up services including collecting long term health and development data about animals they have bread, and guaranteeing to take back any animals if their situation is not mutually beneficial for the pet and the owner, and then placing them in a new home.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The AKC says that their organization serves to prevent animal cruelty by suspending the benefits of their breed registry and other services from members convicted of animal cruelty, and that their inspection program actively uncovers cases of inhumane treatment of dogs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says the AKC has lobbied against laws to stop puppy mills, and that many of the breeders certified as humane by AKC inspectors were later convicted of animal cruelty offenses, while the AKC says it has favored legislation that is necessary, but worked to stop well-intentioned laws that are unenforceable or counterproductive, such as kennel population limits that may harm genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=HSUS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS does not advocate banning breeding but encourages prospective pet owners to seek a breed rescue organization rather than buying directly from a breeder.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

[[Backyard breeding]] and [[puppy mill]]s are motivated by profit and the perceived high demand for a particular breed, often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through [[pet store]]s or directly from the breeders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/ |title=Puppy Mills: The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Humanesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AKC says that negligence and cruelty to animals is illegal throughout the US, and that the solution to irresponsible breeding is more effective enforcement of the law, rather than blaming responsible breeders or the demand for purebred animals.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA's legislative stance is similar to the AKC.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA also says that cat overpopulation is due to free roaming, unaltered pet cats, and feral cats, not purebreds.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA says that animal control agencies have failed to publicize complete statistics on the killing of dogs and cats that are dangerously aggressive, concealing the degree to which pet animal euthanasia will always be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=CFAleg&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.cfa.org/Legislative/LegislativeGroup.aspx |title= CFA's Legislative Group |publisher=[[Cat Fanciers' Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to premise==
[[Nathan Winograd]] of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a promoter of [[no-kill shelter]]s, says that overpopulation is a myth and logical fallacy, which many animal control agencies use to avoid criticism for high numbers of killings and low numbers of adoptions.&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says that traditional shelters kill animals primarily out of habit and convenience, even when space is available for the animals.&lt;ref name="Overpopulation myth"/&gt;{{rp|6}} He says that using [[trap-neuter-return]] (TNR) for stray and feral cats, his organizations have been able to save all healthy and treatable animals, and raise their save rates to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="No Kill 101"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt; He says there are enough homes for all the homeless animals: "Based on the number of existing households with pets who have a pet die or run away, more homes potentially become available each year for cats than the number of cats who enter shelters, while more than twice as many homes potentially become available each year for dogs than the number of dogs who enter shelters."&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says his methods, including TNR for stray and feral cats, and comprehensive changes in animal control, rescue, shelter and community efforts have succeeded in saving all healthy and treatable animals, amounting to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; Winograd says that hundreds of No Kill Communities have been created across the U.S., and they are increasing in number throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Dollars &amp; Sense"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; In October 2014, the website "Out the Front Door" documented 212 communities in the U.S. saving more than 90% of impounded animals.&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt;

Christie Keith, social media adviser for animal welfare organizations, said in 2012 that the use of the term "overpopulation" to justify shelter killings involves the logical fallacy of a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; If a shelter with no adoption program was able to save more animals when a program was added and then enhanced, was the improvement in save rates due to a "Reduction in 'pet over-population'? Or improvement in shelter management practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; When communities are able to save more than 90% of the animals admitted, Keith asks, "Did they reduce 'pet over-population,' or did they become a no-kill community by implementing modern, proven, progressive sheltering practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;{{What?|date=December 2017}}

In a 2008 article, dog advocate Loretta Baughan said that underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. She said that the great majority of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanieljournal.com/33lbaughan.html "Pet underpopulation: The Pet Shortage in the U.S. by Loretta Baughan"], Loretta Baughan, Spaniel Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 4, Jan.-Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32487">'''Road ecology''' is the study of the [[Environmental issue|ecological effects]] (both positive and negative) of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s (public roads). These effects may include local effects, such as on [[noise pollution|noise]], [[water pollution]], [[habitat destruction]]/disturbance and local [[air quality]]; and wider effects such as [[habitat fragmentation]], ecosystem degradation, and [[climate change]] from vehicle emissions.

The design, construction and management of [[roads]], [[parking]] and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of [[vehicle]]s can change their effect. Roads are known to cause significant [[forest destruction|damage to forests]], prairies, streams and [[wetlands]].&lt;ref name="Forman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Forman, R.T.T. |author2=Sperling, D. |author3=Bissonette, J.A. |author4=Clevenger, A.P. |author5=Cutshall, C.D. |author6=Dale, V.H. |author7=Fahrig, L. |author8=France, R.L. |author9=Goldman, C.R. |author10=Heanue, K. |year=2002|title=Road Ecology: Science and Solutions|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781559639330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=As1yk7rRUhsC|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the direct habitat loss due to the road itself, and the [[roadkill]] of animal species, roads alter water-flow patterns, increase [[noise pollution|noise]], [[water pollution|water]], and [[air pollution]], create disturbance that alters the [[species composition]] of nearby vegetation thereby reducing habitat for local native animals, and act as barriers to animal movements. Roads are a form of [[Linear infrastructure intrusions|linear infrastructure intrusion]] that has some effects similar to infrastructure such as railroads, power lines, and canals, particularly in [[tropical forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laurance|first=William F.|last2=Goosem|first2=Miriam|last3=Laurance|first3=Susan G.W.|title=Impacts of roads and linear clearings on tropical forests|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2009.06.009|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=24|issue=12|pages=659–669|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road ecology is practiced as a field of inquiry by a variety of ecologists, biologists, [[hydrologist]]s, engineers, and other scientists. There are several global centers for the study of road ecology: 1) The Road Ecology Center &lt;ref&gt;[http://roadecology.ucdavis.edu]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308232133/https://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/ |date=2018-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of California, Davis, which was the first of its kind in the world; 2) the Centro Brasileiro de Estudos em Ecologia de Estradas at the Federal University of Lavras, Brazil;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbee.ufla.br/portal/ |title=Portal CBEE · Centro Brasileiro de Estudos em Ecologia de Estradas |website=Cbee.ufla.br |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3) The Center for Transportation and the Environment, North Carolina State University;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cte.ncsu.edu/ |title=Center for Transportation and the Environment (CTE) |website=Cte.ncsu.edu |date=2014-08-19 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4) the Road Ecology Program at the Western Transportation Institute, Montana State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wti.montana.edu/ |title=Western Transportation Institute - Western Transportation Institute &amp;#124; Montana State University |website=Wti.montana.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several important global conferences for road ecology research: 1) Infra-Eco Network Europe (IENE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iene.info |title=IENE – Infra Eco Network Europe |website=Iene.info |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is international, but focused primarily on Europe; 2) International Conference on Ecology and Transportation (ICOET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icoet.net |title=2017 International Conference on Ecology and Transportation |publisher=ICOET |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also global in scope, but primarily focused on the US; 3) Australasian Network for Ecology &amp; Transportation (ANET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecologyandtransport.com/ |title=ANET |website=Ecologyandtransport.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the Australasian (sub)continent; and 4) a potential Southern African road ecology conference, being considered by the Endangered Wildlife Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewt.org.za |title=Endangered Wildlife Trust |website=Ewt.org.za |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-icing chemicals===
The chemicals applied to roads along with grit for [[de-ice|de-icing]] are primarily [[Road salt|Salt]] and [[calcium chloride]].&lt;ref name=Ramakrishna&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-005-8265-9?LI=true#page-1|title=Environmental Impact Of Chemical Deicers – A Review

An increased level of chloride in water due to salt application to roads can be widespread in waterways, rather than a local phenomenon of the road edge itself.&lt;ref name="Ramakrishna" /&gt;

==Noise==
Motor vehicle traffic on roads will generate [[noise]], in a wide range of [[Audio frequency|frequencies]] which can affect both humans and animals.

===Negative effects===
[[Noise pollution]] is a factor of environmental degradation that is often overlooked and typically seen as not having a significant effect, though traffic noise can contribute to numerous disturbances for wildlife. An increasing number of studies have been done on the effects of noise on wildlife. Both the sounds made by motors and the wind over moving vehicle structures, and the ultrasonic vibrations transmitted through the air and ground from vehicle passage can overlap with the frequency ranges and amplitudes used by animals for [[Animal communication|communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Clinton D.|last2=Ortega|first2=Catherine P.|last3=Cruz|first3=Alexander|title=Noise Pollution Changes Avian Communities and Species Interactions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982209013281|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=16|pages=1415–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shier|first=D.M.|last2=Lea|first2=A.J.|last3=Owen|first3=M.A.|title=Beyond masking: Endangered Stephen’s kangaroo rats respond to traffic noise with footdrumming|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320712001504|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=150|issue=1|pages=53–58|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grade|first=Aaron M.|last2=Sieving|first2=Kathryn E.|date=2016-04-01|title=When the birds go unheard: highway noise disrupts information transfer between bird species|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/4/20160113|journal=Biology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=20160113|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2016.0113|issn=1744-9561|pmid=27095267|pmc=4881358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies revealed that noise can have a negative effect, particularly on birds. Noise from major roads can interrupt or interfere with the calls of song birds, and their instinctive calls associated with mating, communication, migration, and other purposes are hindered by noise from roads. One study did not necessarily directly provide a fatal effect for the tested birds, but the study showed that species abundance declined around major roads due to noise.&lt;ref name="Fahrig"&gt;Fahrig, Lenore, and Trina Rytwinski. "Effects Of Roads On Animal Abundance: An Empirical Review And Synthesis."Ecology &amp; Society 14.1 (2009): 1-20. Environment Complete. Web. 25 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Noise effects may also modify the behaviour of certain species, such as birds and their feeding behaviours. Birds may spend an increasing amount of time using visual scanning to spot predators as a result of auditory cues and alarm signals from other species being masked by noise pollution. A decreased amount of time spent feeding may lower the mean body weight of birds living near roads, which directly affects their survival rates in a negative fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HABIB|first=LUCAS|last2=BAYNE|first2=ERIN M.|last3=BOUTIN|first3=STAN|date=2007-02-01|title=Chronic industrial noise affects pairing success and age structure of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01234.x|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=176–184|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01234.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road noise can be a nuisance if it impinges on population centres, especially for roads at higher operating speeds, near intersections and on uphill sections.  [[Noise health effects]] can be expected in such locations from road systems used by large numbers of motor vehicles.  [[Noise mitigation]] strategies exist to reduce sound levels at nearby sensitive receptors. The idea that road design could be influenced by [[acoustical engineering]] considerations first arose about 1973.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Speed bumps]], which are usually deployed in built-up areas, can increase [[noise pollution]]. This is especially the case if large vehicles use the road and particularly at night.

===Positive effects===
New roads can divert traffic away from population centres thus relieving the [[noise pollution]].  A new road scheme planned in [[Shropshire]], UK promises to reduce traffic noise in [[Shrewsbury]] town centre.&lt;ref name=shrop&gt;{{cite web

==Effects on wildlife==
=== Habitat fragmentation ===
{{main|Barrier effect}}
[[File:Indian Giant Squirrel Ratufa indica malabar giant squirrel roadkill anaimalai hills.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[Indian giant squirrel]], a [[Arboreal animal|tree dweller]], killed on a road that has disrupted the rainforest canopy]]
Roads can act as barriers or filters to animal movement and lead to [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name=RMEE&gt;

Habitat fragmentation may also divide large continuous populations into smaller more isolated populations.&lt;ref name=RMEE/&gt; These smaller populations are more vulnerable to [[genetic drift]], [[inbreeding depression]] and an increased risk of population decline and extinction.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt; Whether or not this effect is observed depends greatly on the size and mobility of the species in question and the spatial scale at which the fragmetation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KELLER|first=I.|last2=NENTWIG|first2=W.|last3=LARGIADÈR|first3=C.

The presence of roads also decreases the amount of habitat accessible to species. This is to say that it decreases the amount of usable habitat available to organisms without crossing a road. That being said, whether a habitat on the other side of the road becomes inaccessible to an organism or not varies between species. Roads are a permeable barrier to some organisms and impermeable to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigenbrod|first=Felix|last2=Hecnar|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Fahrig|first3=Lenore|date=2008-02-01|title=Accessible habitat: an improved measure of the effects of habitat loss and roads on wildlife populations|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-007-9174-7|journal=Landscape Ecology|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=159–168|doi=10.1007/s10980-007-9174-7|issn=0921-2973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibians and reptiles===
[[Image:Common-snapping-turtle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Common snapping turtle|Snapping turtle]] (''Chelydra serpentina'') crossing a road]]
Roads can be particularly hazardous to populations of amphibians and reptiles that migrate to vernal pools,&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition).

Also some turtles have been noted to lay their eggs on road shoulders. Migratory patterns from season to season can also bring frogs and snakes into contact with roads and lead to an increase in their mortality rates.&lt;ref name=Fahrig/&gt;

===Birds===
The traffic load near large cities may show dramatic cyclical changes induced by weekend tourism, and this could induce cyclical changes in the activity patterns of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bautista |first1=L.M. |last2=García |first2=J.T.|last3=Calmaestra |first3=R.G. |last4=Palacín |first4=C.|last5=Martín |first5=C.A. |last6=Morales |first6=M.B.|last7=Bonal |first7=R.|last8=Viñuela |first8=J. |year=2004|title=Effect of weekend road traffic on the use of space by raptors |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=18 |pages=725–732 |url=https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/43806 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00499.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road implantation may also lead birds to avoid certain sites, as they are seen as being less habitable (because of increases in noise and chemical pollution). Certain bird populations may then become confined into smaller habitable sites, leading to an increase in possibility of extinction caused by illness or habitat perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinto|first=Márcia|last2=Rocha|first2=Pedro|last3=Moreira|first3=Francisco|title=Long-term trends in great bustard (Otis tarda) populations in Portugal suggest concentration in single high quality area|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000632070500073X|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=124|issue=3|pages=415–423|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.01.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilitation of poaching of flora and fauna===
{{Main| Bush meat|Wildlife trade|Illegal logging}}
Roads that run through forests that house edible animals may encourage or facilitate [[poaching]]. Especially in poor areas, the construction of roads has promoted not only poaching for personal consumption but also for sale (for consumption or as a pet) to third parties.

Similarly, the construction of roads in forested areas has also promoted illegal logging as it becomes easier for illegal loggers to transport the wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/content/roads-are-ruining-rainforests |title=Roads are ruining the rainforests &amp;#124; Illegal Logging Portal |website=Illegal-logging.info |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation efforts==
===Awareness===
Awareness needs to be spread among drivers particularly those driving on forest road on maintaining speed limits and being vigilant. [[Environment Conservation Group]] had initiated an awareness drive named PATH an acronym for Provide Animals safe Transit on Highways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/conservation/10297-driven-to-protect-a-journey-across-india-to-document-wild-roadkills.html |title=Driven To Protect – A Journey Across India To Document Wild Roadkills |website=Sanctuaryasia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering more than 17,000&amp;nbsp;km in India to highlighting the importance of safe driving on forest roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/stop-the-animals-are-crossing/article8029760.ece|title=Stop! The animals are crossing|author=K. Jeshi|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road permeability===
[[Wildlife crossings]] that allow [[animal]]s to safely cross human-made barriers such as roads, are intended not only to reduce roadkill, but ideally to provide connectivity of habitat areas, combating [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name=Forman/&gt; Wildlife crossings may include: [[Tunnel|underpass tunnels]], [[viaduct]]s, and [[overpass]]es.

===Habitat construction and planting===
In Washington County, North Carolina, along Highway 64, a study was conducted to analyze the effects of wildlife underpasses on the local wildlife. Three wildlife underpasses were built with fencing around the highway in the study zones. The study showed that deer used the underpasses the most and made up 93% of all crossings. Mortality rates were calculated and showed that the numbers of deaths were lower near underpasses. This cannot be said about all animals. Some have smaller home ranges so they were not inclined to travel to underpasses to cross the road. Underpass would most likely benefit larger mammals such as bears, deer, and cougars. Underpasses were seen to lower mortality rates and increase local species ability to adapt to a habitat along a major road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McCollister, Matthew F. |author2=Frank T. Van Manen |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010|title=Effectiveness of Wildlife Underpasses and Fencing to Reduce Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|volume=74|issue=8|pages=1722–1731|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2009-535|doi=10.2193/2009-535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycling===
Materials removed from a road can be reused in construction within the same project&lt;ref name=SCS&gt;
{{cite journal

|doi= 10.1016/j.scs.2014.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in other locations. Road construction can also use waste materials from other industries.

Asphalt pavement is one of the most recycled materials in the United States. It is estimated that over 80% of asphalt pavement removed from roadways is reused as [[construction aggregate]]. It can be mixed into new pavement or used as a subbase or fill material. Similarly, concrete from road or building demolition can be an excellent source of aggregate.&lt;ref name=waste&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/infrastructure/structures/97148/ |title=User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date= 2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of waste products used in road building include coal [[fly ash]] (used to make concrete stronger), asphalt shingles and shredded [[waste tire|tire]]s (used in asphalt pavement), ground glass  and steel mill [[slag]] (used as aggregates).&lt;ref name=waste/&gt;

In 2012, US asphalt plants used an estimated 68.3 million tons of reclaimed asphalt pavement, 1.86 million tons of recycled asphalt shingles, and over 1 million tons of other recycled materials to produce new asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrecycler.com/napa-survey-recycled-asphalt.aspsx |title=Survey finds growth in recycled materials for asphalt |work=Construction and Demolition Recycling |date=February 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223141734/http://www.cdrecycler.com/napa-survey-recycled-asphalt.aspsx |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social undermining '''is the expression of negative emotions directed towards a particular person or negative evaluations of the person as a way to prevent the person from achieving his or her [[goal]]s. This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or [[anger]]. The negative evaluation of the person may involve [[criticizing]] his or her actions, efforts or characteristics.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"&gt;Joseph, N. T., Myers, H. F., Schettino, J. R., Olmos, N. T., Bingham-Mira, C., Lesser, I. M., &amp; Poland, R. E. (2011). Support and undermining in interpersonal relationships are associated with treatment response to a trial of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 74(3), 240-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and [[office politics|co-workers]]. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive [[interpersonal relationship]], success and a good [[reputation]].&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenbaum | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Mawritz | first2 = M. | last3 = Eissa | first3 = G. | year = 2012 | title = Bottom-line mentality as an antecedent of social undermining and the moderating roles of core self-evaluations and conscientiousness | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 343–359 | doi=10.1037/a0025217 | pmid=22268488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how an employee can use social undermining in the work environment are behaviors that are used to delay the work of co-workers, to make them look bad or slow them down, competing with co-workers to gain status and recognition and giving co-workers incorrect or even misleading information about a particular job.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Definition==
According to Duffy, Gangster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Ganster | first2 = D.C. | last3 = Pagon | first3 = M | year = 2002 | title = Social undermining in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 331–352 | doi=10.2307/3069350| jstor = 3069350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Social undermining has been very effective in the workplace.&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. [[social support]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Social undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depersonalization]], and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being.

Various different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors{{which|date=September 2015}} that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: "what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?" These studies' findings{{which|date=September 2015}} indicate that "this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient".&lt;ref name=folger1998&gt;Folger, R., &amp; Cropanzano, R.

Behaviors of social undermining can affect a person and his or her perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gant |first1=LM |last2=Nagda |first2=BA |last3=Brabson |first3=HV |last4=Jayaratne |first4=S |last5=Chess |first5=WA |last6=Singh |first6=A |title=Effects of social support and undermining on African American workers' perceptions of coworker and supervisor relationships and psychological well-being |journal=Social Work |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=158–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8480245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998.&lt;ref name=folger1998/&gt; The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimatis, M., &amp; Wells, G. (1995). Individual differences in counter-factual thinking. In N. Roese &amp; J. Olson (Eds.), What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking (pp. 81–102). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling "singled out".

===Envy===
While social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about [[envy]]. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Abusive supervision===
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive [[Supervisor|supervision]] can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome" ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi=10.2307/1556375| jstor = 1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., &amp; Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S. H. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | year = 1997 | title = A hostility scale for the California Psychological Inventory: MMPI, observer Q-sort, and Big-five correlates | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 408–424 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6902_11| pmid = 9392898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref name=hoobler/&gt;

===Bottom-line mentality===
[[Bottom line]] is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt; Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Employees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Individual differences==

Research suggests that whether or not someone engages in [[social support]] or social undermining depends upon their own [[goal]]s. Those with [[compassionate]] goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Canevello | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Creating and undermining social support in communal relationships: The role of compassionate and self-image goals | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 555–575 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.555 | pmid=18729694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Research{{which|date=May 2015}} has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring.

Research by Joseph et al.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"/&gt; found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction.

A 2007 study conducted by Benyamini, Medalion and Garfinkel showed that support from a spouse while being seriously ill helped a person to cope with their illness.&lt;ref name=benyamini&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benyamini | first1 = Y. | last2 = Medalion | first2 = B. | last3 = Garfinkel | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Patient and spouse perceptions of the patient's heart disease and their associations with received and provided social support and undermining | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 765–785 | doi=10.1080/14768320601070639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study used patients who had heart disease. The intention of the study was to find if positive and negative interactions between the patients who have heart disease and their spouse can cause spouse support or spouse undermining. The researchers found that when the patient considered their illness as being negative (e.g., especially painful or likely to be chronic) they tended to want more support from the spouse and tended  to feel as if their spouse was not providing sufficient support. This could cause the patient to believe that they were experiencing social undermining. Other times, the partner's actions could cause the patient to feel as if the spouse was acting critical towards them. This could turn into social undermining, causing the spouse to think that the patient was not taking their condition seriously. When the spouse showed that the illness was serious, it could sometimes cause the spouse to become over-protective of the partner. This could also cause the spouse to be critical of their partner behavior, and the partner could provide less support for the patient. The results of the study were that when a spouse had negative views of the illness, he or she engaged in both more support and more undermining.&lt;ref name=benyamini/&gt;

Research conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} Vinokur &amp; Vinokur &amp; Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship.

Cranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="citation journal"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Nutrition and exercise===
Research has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine [[parenting styles]] in order to raise healthy children.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
Another study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior,  try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Market, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently.  Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackert | first1 = M. | last2 = Stanforth | first2 = D. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = A. A. | year = 2011 | title = Undermining of nutrition and exercise decisions: Experiencing negative social influence | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 402–410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Social undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350| citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support.

Vinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt; They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993)&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"/&gt;  found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.

The results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;

Another example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCaskill | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Lakey | first2 = B. | year = 2000 | title = Perceived support, social undermining, and emotion: Idiosyncratic and shared perspectives of adolescents and their families | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 820–832 | doi=10.1177/0146167200269007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002)&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"/&gt; found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.

Researchers found that in adolescent self-reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions  of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is.&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

Due to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

==Emotional and behavioral reactions==
Research has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased [[Counterproductive work behavior|counterproductive behaviors]], reciprocated social undermining, and decreased [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crossley | first1 = C. D. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional and behavioral reactions to social undermining: A closer look at perceived offender motives | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=managementfacpub| journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 14–24 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased [[self-esteem]] and even [[psychosomatic]] symptoms.

In a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009" /&gt; found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender.

[[Posttraumatic embitterment disorder|Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder]] can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.

'''Security and strategic studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] centered on the study of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]] [[Strategy|strategies]], often devoting special attention to the relationship between [[international politics]], [[geostrategy]], [[international diplomacy]], [[international economics]], and [[armed forces|military power]]. In the scope of the studies are also subjects such as the role of [[intelligence]], [[diplomacy]], and international cooperation for security and defense. The subject is normally taught at the [[post-graduate]] academic or professional, usually strategic-political and strategic-military levels.

The academic foundations of the subject began with classic texts initially from the Orient such as [[Sun Tzu]]’s ''[[Art of War]]'' and went on to gain a European focus with [[Carl von Clausewitz]]’s ''[[On War]]''. Like Clausewitz, many academics in this field reject monocausal theories and hypotheses that reduce the study of conflict to one independent variable and one dependent variable.  Already in the late eighteenth century, a colourful mathematician named [[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] attempted to establish mathematical formulae for the conduct of war.  Carl von Clausewitz rejected Bülow’s approach and his popular claim that warfare could be reduced to positivist, teachable principles of war.  Instead of formulae, we find Clausewitz stressing, time and again, that the whole purpose of educating the military commander is not to give him a series of answers for the task he will face (the complexities of which cannot be foreseen), but to educate him about different aspects of what will face him so as to let him evaluate the situation for himself, and develop his own strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Otte: “Educating Bellona: Carl von Clausewitz and Military Education”, in G.C. Kennedy &amp; K. Neilson (eds): ''Military Education: Past, Present and Future'' (New York: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic thinkers on the whole will search for recurrent patterns, which in themselves cannot predict the characteristics of any individual case even if it doubtless fits a larger category; not all patterns of characteristics will be found in all cases.

In recent times, the major conflicts of the nineteenth century and the two [[World Wars]] have spurred strategic thinkers such as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], [[Julian Corbett|Corbett]], [[Giulio Douhet]], [[Liddell Hart]] and, later, [[Andre Beaufre|André Beaufre]]. The Cold War with its danger of degenerating into a nuclear war produced an expansion of the discipline, with authors like [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lucien Poirier]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Colin S. Gray|Colin Gray]], and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3790">'''SRANK''' or '''Subnational Rank''' seeks to ascertain the rarity of [[species]] within subnational boundaries (such as a [[province]] or [[State (administrative division)|state]]).

Below is the ranking definitions used by the [[Ontario]] [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]], and will vary by province or state.  This ranking system is widely used by the conservation data centres in each of the provinces and states.  Refer to NatureServe for the overall ranking system used by conservation data centres (CDCs) across North America as well as the actual S-ranks of all the species evaluated.  OMNR is one such CDC.

* '''SX — Presumed Extirpated'''  Species or community is believed to be extirpated from the province or state.  Not located despite intensive searches of historical sites and other appropriate habitat, and virtually no likelihood that it will be rediscovered.
* '''SH — Possibly Extirpated (Historical)'''  Species or community occurred historically in the province or state, and there is some possibility that it may be rediscovered.  Its presence may not have been verified in the past 20–40 years. A species or community could become SH without such a 20-40 year delay if the only known occurrences in a province or state were destroyed or if it had been extensively and unsuccessfully looked for. The SH rank is reserved for species or communities for which some effort has been made to relocate occurrences, rather than simply using this status for all elements not known from verified extant occurrences.
* '''S1 — Critically Imperiled'''  Critically imperiled in the province or state because of extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer occurrences) or because of some factor(s) such as very steep declines making it especially vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S2 — Imperiled'''  Imperiled in the province or state because of rarity due to very restricted range, very few populations (often 20 or fewer), steep declines, or other factors making it very vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S3 — Vulnerable'''  Vulnerable in the province or state due to a restricted range, relatively few populations (often 80 or fewer), recent and widespread declines, or other factors making it vulnerable to extirpation.
* '''S4 — Apparently Secure'''  Uncommon but not rare; some cause for long-term concern due to declines or other factors.
* '''S5 — Secure'''  Common, widespread, and abundant in the state or province.
* '''SNR — Unranked'''  Province or state conservation status not yet assessed.
* '''SU — Unrankable'''  Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends.
* '''SNA — Not Applicable'''  A conservation status rank is not applicable because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities.
* '''S#S# — Range Rank'''  A numeric range rank (e.g., S2S3) is used to indicate any range of uncertainty about the status of the species or community. Ranges cannot skip more than one rank (e.g., SU is used rather than S1S4).

A similar ranking system is used for the "G-ranks" and "N-ranks" which are the Global (G) and National (N) status ranks for species.  Again refer to NatureServe.org for additional details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7753">In the [[systems sciences]] '''system equivalence''' is the behavior of a [[parameter]] or component of a [[system]] in a way similar to a parameter or component of a different system.  Similarity means that mathematically the parameters and components will be indistinguishable from each other. Equivalence can be very useful in understanding how [[complex system]]s work.

== Overview ==
Examples of equivalent systems are first- and second-[[order (differential equation)|order]] (in the [[independent variable]]) [[translational]], [[electrical]], [[Torque|torsional]], [[Fluid mechanics|fluidic]], and [[caloric]] systems.

Equivalent systems can be used to change large and expensive mechanical, thermal, and fluid systems into a simple, cheaper electrical system.  Then the electrical system can be analyzed to validate that the [[system dynamics]] will work as designed.  This is a preliminary inexpensive way for engineers to test that their complex system performs the way they are expecting.

This testing is necessary when designing new complex systems that have many components.  Businesses do not want to spend millions of dollars on a system that does not perform the way that they were expecting. Using the equivalent system technique, engineers can verify and prove to the business that the system will work.  This lowers the risk factor that the business is taking on the project.

The equivalents shown in the chart are not the only way to form mathematical analogies.  In fact there are any number of ways to do this.  A common requirement for analysis is that the analogy correctly models energy storage and flow across energy domains.  To do this, the equivalences must be compatible.  A pair of variables whose product is power (or energy) in one domain must be equivalent to a pair of variables in the other domain whose product is also power (or energy).  These are called power conjugate variables.  The thermal variables shown in the chart are not power conjugates and thus do not meet this criterion.  See [[mechanical-electrical analogies]] for more detailed information on this.  Even specifying power conjugate variables does not result in a unique analogy and there are at least three analogies of this sort in use.  At least one more criterion is needed to uniquely specify the analogy, such as the requirement that [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is equivalent in all domains as is done in the [[impedance analogy]].

==Examples==
; Mechanical systems
:Force &lt;math&gt;F = -kx = c\frac{dx}{dt} = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

; Electrical systems
:Voltage &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Q}{C} = R\frac{dQ}{dt} = L\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

All the fundamental [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] of these systems have the same functional form.

==Discussion==
The system equivalence method may be used to describe systems of two types: "vibrational" systems (which are thus described - approximately - by harmonic oscillation) and "translational" systems (which deal with "flows").  These are not mutually exclusive; a system may have features of both. Similarities also exist; the two systems can often be analysed by the methods of Euler, Lagrange and Hamilton, so that in both cases the energy is quadratic in the relevant degree(s) of freedom, provided they are linear.

Vibrational systems are often described by some sort of wave (partial differential) equation, or oscillator (ordinary differential) equation. Furthermore, these sorts of systems follow the capacitor or spring analogy, in the sense that the dominant degree of freedom in the energy is the generalized position. In more physical language, these systems are predominantly characterised by their potential energy. This often works for solids, or (linearized) undulatory systems near equilibrium.

On the other hand, flow systems may be easier described by the hydraulic analogy or the diffusion equation. For example, Ohm's law was said to be inspired by Fourier's law (as well as the work of C.-L. Navier).&lt;ref&gt;

The most important idea is the flux, or rate of transfer of some important physical quantity considered (like electric or magnetic fluxes). In these sorts of systems, the energy is dominated by  the derivative of the generalized position (generalized velocity). In physics parlance, these systems tend to be kinetic energy-dominated. Field theories, in particular electromagnetism, draw heavily from the hydraulic analogy.

==History==
The [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]] initially funded the creation of the TeachEngineering library through its [[National Science Digital Library|National Science Digital Library (NSDL)]] program&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://www.teachengineering.org/about/history “History.”] TeachEngineering Digital Library. Retrieved 27 June, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. University engineering faculty, graduate students and K-12 teachers from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], [[Colorado School of Mines]], [[Duke University]] and [[Tufts University]] who had independently developed K-12 engineering curriculum, bundled their curricular products into a single, standardized and searchable digital library&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. By 2017, more than 50 institutions had contributed curriculum&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkengineering.org/15/244/45362.aspx “TeachEngineering”] Organization page, LinkEngineering, National Academy of Engineering. Retrieved June 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty and students at [[Oregon State University]] designed and developed the supporting information system&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In 2015, the system was re-designed and rebuilt at the University of Colorado Boulder. About 3 million unique users visit the library annually&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Forbes, Marissa H., Sullivan, Jacquelyn F. and Carlson, Denise W. (2017) [https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/78/papers/17882/view “Ascertaining the Impact of P-12 Engineering Education Initiatives: Student Impact through Teacher Impact,”] Proceedings, ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition, Columbus, OH, June.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Use Patterns==
[[File:TeachEngineering daily visits.png|Year-long trace of TeachEngineering visits.]]&lt;br&gt;
TeachEngineering usage closely tracks the US K-12 school seasons. As one can see from the figure above, daily demand follows a strict weekly cycle with usage consistently lowest on Saturdays. Usage starts to increase on Sundays when teachers prepare for classes for the coming week and further increases through Wednesdays. On Thursdays and Fridays demand decreases back toward the Saturday low. On a larger cycle, usage typically increases from the start of the school year (in August) to a peak in late March (around [[spring break]]), after which it starts trending down toward the summer vacation. Holidays such as [[Independence_Day_(United_States)|the Fourth of July]], and [[Thanksgiving]] also clearly stand out in this one-year long trajectory of daily use.

==Motivation==
The initial motivation to create the library was the desire to preserve and widely share the outcomes from NSF’s investment in K-12 engineering curriculum development through the creation of a single standardized, searchable and standards-aligned platform&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Ongoing motivations include:
* To create and maintain a collection of freely available, standards-based engineering curriculum, for the purpose of improving STEM literacy&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.
* To provide curriculum that uses engineering as the vehicle for early development of engineering habits of mind for all youth&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.
* To attract more, and more diverse students to the field of engineering&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1544495 NSF Grant no. EEC 1544495: TeachEngineering: Expanding and Sustaining Curriculum Access for K-12 Teachers; 2015]. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1544495&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
* To support educators in meeting academic learning standards by aligning curricular materials with K-12 national, international and/or state standards&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.
* To provide K-12 science and math teachers with science-rich hands-on engineering curriculum at little to no cost&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Technology==
During 2003-15, TeachEngineering ran on a [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP stack]] hosted at Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab (OSL). In 2015, the system was reimplemented on a Windows/IIS/RavenDB/C# stack and is currently hosted on [[Microsoft Azure]] and maintained by the [[University_of_Colorado_Boulder|University of Colorado, Boulder]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">[[Image:Texture splatting.png|thumb|250px|Example of texture splatting.]]In [[computer graphics]], '''texture splatting''' is a method for combining different [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]]. The method works by applying an [[Transparency (graphic)|alphamap]] (also called a "weightmap" or "splat map") to the higher levels, revealing the layers underneath where the alphamap is partially or completely transparent. The term was coined by Crawfis et al.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~crawfis.3/Publications/Textured_Splats93.pdf Texture Splats for 3D Vector and Scalar     Field Visualization]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optimizations ==
Since texture splatting is commonly used for [[terrain rendering]] in [[computer game]]s, various optimizations are required. Because the underlying principle is for each texture to have its own [[alpha channel]], large amounts of [[computer memory|memory]] can easily be consumed. As a solution to this problem, multiple alpha maps can be combined into one texture using the red channel for one map, the blue for another, and so on. This effectively uses a single texture to supply alpha maps for four real-color textures. The alpha textures can also use a lower resolution than the color textures, and often the color textures can be tiled.

Terrains can also be split into chunks where each chunk can have its own textures. Say there is a certain texture on one part of the terrain that doesn’t appear anywhere else on it: it would be a waste of memory and processing time if the alpha map extended over the whole terrain if only 10% of it was actually required. If the terrain is split into chunks then the alpha map can also be split up according to the chunks and so now instead of 90% of that specific map being wasted only 20% may be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7588">{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Wagner's gene network model''' is a computational model of artificial gene networks, which explicitly modeled the developmental and evolutionary process of [[genetic regulatory networks]]. A [[population]] with multiple organisms can be created and evolved from generation to generation. It was first developed by [[Andreas Wagner]] in 1996&lt;ref name="Wagner1996" /&gt; and has been investigated by other groups to study the evolution of [[gene network]]s, [[gene expression]], [[mutational robustness|robustness]], [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] and [[epistasis]].&lt;ref name="Bergman2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azevedo2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertaSanchez2007"/&gt;

== Assumptions ==
The model and its variants have a number of simplifying assumptions.  Three of them are listing below.
#The organisms are modeled as gene regulatory networks.  The models assume that gene expression is regulated exclusively at the transcriptional level;
#The product of a gene can regulate the expression of (be a regulator of) that source gene or other genes.  The models assume that a gene can only produce one active transcriptional regulator;
#The effects of one regulator are independent of effects of other regulators on the same target gene.

== Genotype ==
[[File:WagnerModel.png|thumb|Network representation of the regulatory interactions between four genes (G1, G2, G3 and G4). Activations and repressions are denoted by arrows and bars, respectively. Numbers indicate the relative interaction strengths. Interaction matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on the right representing the network on the left.]]
The model represents individuals as networks of interacting transcriptional regulators. Each individual expresses &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genes encoding transcription factors. The product of each gene can regulate the expression level of itself and/or the other genes through [[cis-regulatory element]]s.  The interactions among genes constitute a gene network that is represented by a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; × &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; regulatory matrix &lt;math&gt;(R)&lt;/math&gt; in the model.  The elements in matrix ''R'' represent the interaction strength.  Positive values within the matrix represent the activation of the target gene, while negative ones represent repression. Matrix elements with value 0 indicate the absence of interactions between two genes.

== Phenotype==
[[File:GeneExpressionInWagnerModel.png|thumb|An example of how the gene expression pattern modeled in Wagner model and its variants. G1, G2, G3 and G4 represent genes in the network. Filled box means the gene expression of that particular gene is on; open box means off. Gene expression patterns are represented by the state vector &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; whose elements &lt;math&gt;s_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; describe the expression states of gene &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The phenotype of each individual is modeled as the [[gene expression]] pattern at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It is represented by a state vector &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; in this model.

&lt;math&gt;S(t)\ :=\ (S_1(t),\  . . .,\ S_N(t))&lt;/math&gt;
 
whose elements &lt;math&gt;s_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expression states of gene ''i'' at time ''t''.  In the original Wagner model,

&lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\} &lt;/math&gt;

where 1 represents the gene is expressed while -1 implies the gene is not expressed.  The expression pattern can only be ON or OFF.  The continuous expression pattern between -1 (or 0) and 1 is also implemented in some other variants.&lt;ref name="Bergman2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azevedo2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertaSanchez2007"/&gt;

== Development ==
The development process is modeled as the development of gene expression states.  The gene expression pattern &lt;math&gt;S(0)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the initial expression state.  The interactions among genes change the expression states during the development process.  This process is modeled by the following differential equations

&lt;math&gt;S_l(t+&lt;/math&gt;τ&lt;math&gt;) = &lt;/math&gt;σ &lt;math&gt;[\sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij}S_j(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; σ &lt;math&gt;[h_i](t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_l(t+&lt;/math&gt;τ) represents the expression state of &lt;math&gt;G_l&lt;/math&gt; at time t+τ.  It is determined by a filter function σ&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the weighted sum of regulatory effects (&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;) of all genes on gene &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; at time t.  In the original Wagner model, the filter function is a step function

σ&lt;math&gt;(x)=-1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0;\ 1 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0;\ 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;

In other variants, the filter function is implemented as a sigmoidal function

σ&lt;math&gt;(x)=2/(1+e^{-ax})-1&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the expression states will acquire a continuous distribution.  The gene expression will reach the final state if it reaches a stable pattern.

== Evolution ==
Evolutionary simulations are performed by reproduction-mutation-selection life cycle. Populations are fixed at size N and they will not go extinct. Non-overlapping generations are employed. In a typical evolutionary simulation, a single random viable individual that can produce a stable gene expression pattern is chosen as the founder. Cloned individuals are generated to create a population of N identical individuals. According to the asexual or sexual reproductive mode, offsprings are produced by randomly choosing (with replacement) parent individual(s) from current generation. Mutations can be acquired with probability μ and survive with probability equal to their fitness. This process is repeated until N individuals are produced that go on to found the following generation.

== Fitness ==
Fitness in this model is the probability that an individual survives to reproduce. In the simplest implementation of the model, developmentally stable genotypes survive (i.e. their fitness is 1) and developmentally unstable ones do not (i.e. their fitness is 0).

== Mutation ==
Mutations are modeled as the changes in [[gene regulation]], i.e., the changes of the elements in the regulatory matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Reproduction ==
Both [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]] and [[asexual reproduction]]s are implemented.  Asexual reproduction is implemented as producing the offspring's [[genome]] (the gene network) by directly copying the parent's genome.  Sexual reproduction is implemented as the recombination of the two parents' genomes.

== Selection ==
An organism is considered viable if it reaches a stable gene expression pattern.  An organism with oscillated expression pattern is discarded and cannot enter the next generation.

"'''What Is Theosophy?'''" is an editorial published in October 1879 in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' It was compiled by [[Helena Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|''The Theosophist,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 2–5.{{sfn|Index}}}} and included into the 2nd volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1967}} According to a doctoral thesis by Tim Rudbøg, in this "important" article Blavatsky "began conceptualizing her idea of '[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]'."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=102}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Definition of Theosophy ===
Blavatsky writes that, "according to [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the term ''theosophia'' is composed of two Greek words—''theos'' "god," and ''sophos'' "wise."{{sfn|Britannica}}{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Rudbøg|2012|2p=102}} She then writes that [[Noah Webster]] defines it as "a supposed intercourse with God and superior spirits, and consequent attainment of superhuman knowledge, by ''physical processes,'' as by the [[Theurgy|theurgic]] operations of some ancient [[Platonists]], or by the ''chemical processes'' of the German [[Alchemy|fire-philosophers]]."{{sfnm|Webster|1877|1p=1373|Blavatsky|1879|2p=2|Santucci|2012|3p=233|Rudbøg|2012|4p=98}}{{refn|group=note|Santucci has specified that it mentions here "the theurgy of the [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Iamblichus]], and the fire-philosophers," who were described, for example, by [[Hargrave Jennings]].{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=233}}}} Professor James Santucci wrote that the article author considers this interpretation unsuccessful, calling it "a poor and flippant explanation."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Santucci|2012|2p=233}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky then explains a term "Theosophy," describing who a Theosophist is. To this aim, she uses Vaughan's definition.{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=120}}}} In hers opinion, [[Robert Alfred Vaughan|Robert Vaughan]] has proposed "a far better, more philosophical" definition: "A Theosophist is one who gives you a theory of God or the works of God, which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis."{{sfnm|Vaughan|1856|1p=45|Blavatsky|1879|2p=2|Santucci|2012|3p=234|Rudbøg|2012|4p=120}}{{refn|group=note|Both Santucci and Rudbøg did not notice that Blavatsky inexactly quotes Vaughan: there must be a word "reason" instead of "revelation."}} She continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this view every great thinker and philosopher, especially every founder of a new religion, school of philosophy, or sect, is necessarily a Theosophist. Hence, Theosophy and Theosophists have existed ever since the first glimmering of nascent thought made man seek instinctively for the means of expressing his own independent opinions."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Sender|2007|2p=102|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both [[Alexander Senkevich]] and Tim Rudbøg stated that, to fully define Theosophy, Blavatsky proposes to consider it "under all its aspects."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Сенкевич|2012|2p=348|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}} Both Santucci and Rudbøg have quoted in the article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The interior world has not been hidden from all by impenetrable darkness. By that higher intuition acquired by ''Theosophia''—or God-knowledge, which carries the mind from the world of form into that of formless [[spirit]], man has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things in the interior or invisible world."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that, according to the explanation of Blavatsky, hers Theosophy "is not a religion, but it is divine knowledge or science," and the very term applies not to God, but to the gods or to any divine being, and it is not God's wisdom, but the divine wisdom, i. e. that belongs to the gods at all.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=287}}}}{{refn|group=note|Origin of this term, according to the founders of [Blavatskian] Theosophy, goes back to the schools of the Neoplatonists, but the earliest elements of Theosophy were formed in ancient India, and a word "Theosophy" have its [[Sanskrit]] equivalent—"[[Brahmavidya]]" (Divine Wisdom).{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Santucci wrote that among the Theosophical ancestors, mentioned further by the article author, were the Hindu ascetics, the [[Neoplatonists]], the [[Rosicrucians]] or [[Alchemy|Fire-philosophers]], and other [[mysticism|mystics]]. According to Blavatsky, they were all involved in "the search after man's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|diviner 'self']]," which accompanied the theurgy she described. Santucci stated that, according to [[Iamblichus]], theurgy is, as Blavatsky points in hers article, "the art of applying the divine powers of man to the subordination of the blind forces of nature."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234}} This "search" was often viewed "as individual communion with a personal God", and although this was not true, it was the aim of every mystic at all times.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Сенкевич|2012|2p=348}}{{refn|group=note|The inner divinity is referred [in Theosophy] to by different names: the Uncreate, the inner God, the higher Self, and the Master; alliance with this divine self induces wisdom.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}}}}

Senkevich wrote that the article author quotes [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], a [[spiritualist]] who, as she writes, "with brave candour" claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is 'spirit' that alone feels, and perceives, and thinks—that acquires knowledge, and reasons and aspires... there not unfrequently occur individuals so constituted that the spirit can perceive independently of the corporeal organs of sense, or can perhaps, wholly or partially, quit the body for a time and return to it again... the spirit... communicates with spirit easier than with matter."{{sfnm|Wallace|1866|1pp=42, 43|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Сенкевич|2012|3p=348}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Santucci stated that Theosophy or "Divine Wisdom", according to Blavatsky, is the Highest Truth about God, the universe and man, "It is a Truth that in its pure form is primordial, in that it existed from the dawn of Humanity; [[esoteric]], since only those few individuals capable of understanding such knowledge are allowed to receive it; and universal, because all great minds throughout the world enunciated the same Wisdom."{{sfn|Santucci|1989|p=41}} Rudbøg wrote that this article is the first example in which Blavatsky's "concept of a 'Wisdom-Religion' is directly correlated with 'Theosophy'." He quoted: "Theosophy is, then, the archaic ''Wisdom-Religion,'' the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Rudbøg|2012|2p=105}}{{sfn|Santucci|1989|p=41}}{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=24}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote: "German [[pietism]] expressed fundamentally Theosophic ideas through [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhardt]], [[Johannes Tauler|Tauler]], [[Henry Suso|Suso]], and [[Jacob Boehme]]... In fact there was hardly a period when the ghosts of [[occult]] wisdom did not hover in the background of European thought."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=15}}}} Both Tim Rudbøg and Julia Shabanova have cited Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy as the Wisdom-Religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian [[Budha]], the Babylonian [[Nabu|Nebo]], the [[Thoth]] of Memphis, the [[Hermes]] of Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses—[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Neith]]a, [[Athena]], the [[Gnostic]] ''[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]],'' and finally the [[Vedas]], from the word 'to know'."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Rudbøg|2012|2p=108|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Basic idea of Theosophy ===
James Santucci wrote that Theosophy, according to Blavatsky, "refers to a nexus of teachings associated with the Supreme, the macrocosmos (the universe or Nature), and microcosmos (humanity)." He noted that in hers article she first presents the statement on "a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and ''Unknowable''" which was the "central idea of the [[Eclecticism|Eclectic]] Theosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}}{{refn|group=note|This statement was later developed by the author in the proem to ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' where it is said that there is "an Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888|1p=14|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=91}}}}{{refn|group=note|In ''[[:ru:Новая философская энциклопедия|The New Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' it is said Blavatsky's Theosophy is a "mystical-religious doctrine based on faith in [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] as Unfathomable God, on the law of [[karma]], [[reincarnation]] of soul, and an idea of infinite cosmic evolution."{{sfn|Митюгова|2010}}}}

Professor Julia Shabanova wrote that an idea of Theosophy was not alien to [[German idealism]], with which were traditionally associated [[rationalism]] and even [[panlogism]]; this is about "that Theosophy which", as Blavatsky argues, "prompted such men as [[Hegel]], [[Fichte]] and [[Spinoza]] to take up the labors of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance—the Deity, the ''Divine All'' proceeding from the Divine Wisdom—incomprehensible, unknown and ''unnamed''—by any ancient or modern religious philosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Шабанова|2016|2p=18}}{{refn|group=note|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] used the term "Theosophy" to designate the synthesis of mystical cognition of God and rational philosophy; together it is possible here to refer the concept of "free Theosophy" by [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]].{{sfn|Теософия|2010}}}} Having mentioned these manifestations of Theosophy, the article author declares:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every Theosophist, then, holding to a theory of the Deity 'which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis,' may accept any of the above definitions or belong to any of these religions, and yet remain strictly within the boundaries of Theosophy. For the latter is belief in the Deity as the '''All''', the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing ''It,'' or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is ''blasphemy''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Movement|1951|2p=72}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shabanova wrote that Blavatsky points to the Theosophical method of the consciousness developing, quoting "superb," in hers opinion, essay on ''The Oversoul'' by [[Ralph Emerson]], "I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect."{{sfnm|Emerson|1851|1p=135|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Шабанова|2016|3p=26}} She refers [[Plotinus]], who counted that the secret [[gnosis]], or the knowledge of Theosophy, has "three degrees—opinion, science, and illumination." Blavatsky continues the cite: "The means or instrument of the first is sense, or perception; of the second, dialectics; of the third, intuition. To the last, reason is subordinate; it is ''absolute knowledge,'' founded on the identification of the mind with the object known."{{sfnm|Plotinus|1856|1pp=86–7|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Шабанова|2016|3p=26}} She then writes, "Theosophy is the exact science of psychology, so to say; it stands in relation to natural, uncultivated [[mediumship]], as the knowledge of a [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] stands to that of a school-boy in physics."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=4|Шабанова|2016|2p=26}}{{refn|group=note|"To Blavatsky, Theosophy was empirically verifiable (through science, [[siddhi|psychic powers]], and history)."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=221}}}}

== Criticism of Theosophy ==
Both the explicit ideological opponents of Blavatsky's doctrine and the Western esotericism scholars who claim for objectivity are equally interested in separating modern Theosophy from the classical one.{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] in his 1994 work used the following terminology, "Theosophy and Theosophists, with a capital T, refer to Blavatsky's society and its members, theosophy and theosophers refer to the tradition of religious illumination exemplified by Jacob Boehme and his followers."{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}} Also Santucci stated, "'Theosophy,' with a capital 'T,' represents the modern Theosophy of the Theosophical societies, while theosophy (with a lower-case 't') represents other and usually earlier forms of theosophy."{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=244}}}} For example, according to [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], "contemporary 'theosophical' movements" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and "have made us forget" the existence of a genuine "Christian theosophy". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|pp=270, 299}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] noted that, in contrast to the [[Boehmian theosophy]], Blavatskian Theosophy, "adapting contemporary scientific ideas," raised the concept of "spiritual evolution through countless worlds and eras."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=211}}}}

In professor [[Antoine Faivre]]'s opinion, that what Blavatsky called "Theosophy" was in fact only her own doctrine.{{sfn|Faivre|2000|p=28}} [[René Guénon]] believed that "[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophism]]" is a "confused mixture" of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Jewish Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], and [[occultism]].{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=91}} A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}}

'''Women in the workforce''' earning wages or  salary are part of a modern phenomenon, one that developed at the same time as the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by [[Gender inequality|inequality]] in the workforce. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation in the [[workforce]]. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor [[socio-economic status]] of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become [[professionalization|professionalized]] over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Women's lack of access to [[higher education]] had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]] was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, [[Cambridge University]] only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107063131/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term [[career]]s rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs.

The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of [[working hours|hours worked]] across the regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2007$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rdCufG2vozTpKw7TBGbyoWw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=26;dataMax=56$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=|title=Graph|publisher=[[Gapminder World]] |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men.

Although access to paying occupations (the "workforce") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between "work" and "paying work", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated [[household work]], childcare, [[eldercare]], and family [[subsistence farming]].

==Areas of study==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged in the U.S., [[Virginia Penny]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] was finishing up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-women-can-make-money-married-or-single-in-all-branches-of-the-arts-and-sciences-professions-trades-agricultural-and-mechanical-pursuits/oclc/15690614 ''How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits'' (Philadelphia, 1862)]. Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out instead as an encyclopedia, ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863. It sold better once it was re-titled again in 1870 as ''How Women Can Make Money, Married or Single''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gensemer|first1=Susan H.|title=Penny, Virginia|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/14/14-01170.html|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|accessdate=21 December 2016|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the several different versions of the book ended up with 36 editions published between 1862 and 2006, and six editions of the adaptation in German (first published in 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penny, Virginia 1826-|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n90694085/|website=OCLC WorldCat Identities|publisher=OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[division of labor]] by [[gender]] has been studied most systematically in [[women's studies]] (especially [[women's history]], which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and [[gender studies]] more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the [[history of medicine]] or studies of [[professionalization]], also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists.&lt;ref name="Witz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anne Witz | title = Patriarchy and Professions: The Gendered Politics of Occupational Closure | journal = Sociology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = 1990 | pages = 675–690 | url = http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/675 | doi = 10.1177/0038038590024004007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanagh-2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

In addition, modern [[civil right]]s law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; [[gender discrimination]] within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called [[employment discrimination|employment discrimination law]], and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] in the United States.

==Paid employment globally==
[[File:Changes in percentages of professionals by gender.png|thumbnail|This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007.]]
Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market "hawker". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa.

During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women [[domestic workers]] seeking jobs outside of their native country. The [[Philippines]] is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|title=Overseas deployment of Filipino domestic workers continues to rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|publisher=Inquirer Global Nation|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32067/overseas-deployment-of-filipino-domestic-workers-continues-to-rise|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"/&gt; Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An atlas of migration|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation by sector===
[[File:Computer industry entrepreneur workshop.jpg|thumb|Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State.]]
[[File:Woodstock press photographer.jpg|thumb|A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008.]]

Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):

'''Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007)'''&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Women 2010|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW_full%20report_color.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 15, 2012|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Region'''||'''Agriculture'''||'''Industry'''||'''Services'''
|-
|Africa||43% women / 42% men||11% women / 20% men||46% women / 39% men 
|-
|Asia (excluding China)||32% women / 26% men||12% women / 25% men||56% women / 49% men 
|-
|Latin America and the Caribbean||7% women / 22% men||13% women / 27% men||80% women / 51% men 
|-
|Europe and other more developed regions||6% women / 8% men||15% women / 36% men||79% women / 55% men 
|}

More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%.&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"/&gt;

===Occupational dissimilarity index===
Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages. The occupational [[index of dissimilarity|dissimilarity index]] is a measure from 0 to 100; it measures the percent of laborers that would need to be rearranged into a job typically done by the opposite sex in order for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hong Li J | year = | title = Gender Differences in Class Mobility: A Comparative Study of the United States, Sweden, and West Germany | url = | journal = Acta Sociologica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 315–333 | doi=10.1177/000169939804100402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations formed by women for rights==
In the nineteenth century women became involved in organizations dedicated to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Visions of America A History of the United States, books a La Carte Edition. Pearson College Div, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html#ixzz3Vlm8PLZb Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921-1979).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an organization established by a group of Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices&gt;[http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-womens-organizations-you-need-know "20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know"], Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy. "The American Women's Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with Documents." Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices /&gt; Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.

==Laws protecting women's rights as workers==
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) and [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] attending the World Assembly for Women in [[Tokyo]] to speak on women's rights and empowerment, 2017]]

International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies.  On June 16, 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) passed C189 [[Convention on Domestic Workers|Domestic Workers Convention, 2011]], binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the Convention would put pressure on non-ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switzerland – A step forward for domestic workers|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-Switzerland.html?gwh=9875484B408842FDAE59E701E668F0EF|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeParle|first=Jason|title=Domestic workers convention may be landmark|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/domestic-workers-convention-may-be-landmark.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has previously ratified the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]] in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]], which went into force in 1960 and the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]], which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which went into force in 1976. [[UNESCO]] also adopted the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] in 1960, which came into force in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The [[Home Work Convention]], adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children.

Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, S.

Female decision-makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the "service clubs" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas.

"Women in Management" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks.

As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union|title=Women in National Parliaments|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|title=Facts on Women Officeholders, Candidates and Voters|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the [[Women to the Top]] program in 2003–2005 to bring more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture.

Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in the work force if they choose to enter it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played [[competitive sports]], 52% at a university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-sport-is-a-critical-lever-in-advancing-women-at-all-levels-according-to-new-ey-espnw-report|title=Sport is a critical lever in advancing women at all levels, according to new EY/espnW report|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to equal participation==
As [[gender role]]s have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed [[profession]]s and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include:

*Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field
*[[Discrimination]] within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies
*Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers

Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by ''women'' in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many [[microinequities]].

Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported.

===Access to education and training===
[[File:Maasai women at USAID literacy event (6595762621).jpg|thumb|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] women at [[USAID]] literacy event]]
A number of occupations became "[[professionalization|professionalized]]" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular [[higher education]]al requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to [[Cambridge University]] until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge"].&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007"&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to capital===
[[File:Women's business conference bahia brazil.jpg|thumb|Governor of Bahia, Brazil, attending the first state women's business conference]]
Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.&lt;ref&gt;"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth", ''World News'', June 2, 2004, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208105312/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/may00/23_11_078.html archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[microloan]] programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004"&gt;United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, "FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama", ''World News'', 2004 February 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food — in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production — most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004" /&gt;

===Discrimination within occupations===
[[File:SHG women running a cabinet manufacturing business (5103677355).jpg|thumb|Women operating a cabinet manufacturing business, India]]
{{See also|Gender pay gap|Glass ceiling|Sexual harassment}}
The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218 – 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]'', p.&amp;nbsp;41 (Figure 3.3 "Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men");p.&amp;nbsp;36 (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the textbook ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology'', women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that  women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, “Women’s wages are also more volatile than men’s wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men” (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often give public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, “Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women” (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, “All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)” (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers.

===Actions and inactions of women themselves===
Through a process known as "employee clustering", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.

Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so.&lt;ref name="women's media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com|title=Index of /|publisher=Womensmedia.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Joan Z. "Gender and Education in the US." Gender Mosaics: Social Perspectives. Ed. Dana VannoyOxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take "breaks" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.

==Gender inequality by social class==
[[File:Mechanic at work seattle.jpg|thumb|upright|Mechanic working on a motorcycle, United States]]
In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the [[feminist movement]] of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the [[baby boomer]]s. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.

===Effects on the middle and upper classes===
The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased [[social mobility]] over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of [[birth control]], these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states{{clarification needed|date=December 2018|reason=United States?}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.

In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as "president of the amateur gynecology club." He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the "Spandex Queen. E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as "bimbos" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, ''Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do'', author [[Aparna Jain]] interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/towards-fostering-a-gender-neutral-workplace/story-32TrlU2iOhQfWGGWStcSYL.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/living/book-review-aparna-jains-own-it-brings-out-of-unarticulated-darkness-the-indescribable-things-that-happen-to-women-at-the-workplace-2614092.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]]' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna .&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/sexual-harassment-case-against-ihcl-boss-rakesh-sarna-may-have-added-to-cyrus-mistry-woes/articleshow/55361051.cms&lt;/ref&gt; A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] scandal at [[The Energy and Resources Institute]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/hostile-climate-rk-pachauri-reign-teri&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.

Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case ''Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan'' (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a [[hostile work environment]] on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: "Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment.

This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, "I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.

Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing "woman's purity," the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement."

===Effects on the working class===
Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). ''Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the history of this country,{{which|date=January 2014}} there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

==Impact issues of female participation in the workforce==
A 2008 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave.  At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science Daily]]'', "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212846.htm Women Take Almost 50 Percent More Short-term Sick Leave Than Men]", ''[[BMJ]]'', 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scharlach A. E. |author2=Grosswald B. | year = 1997 | title = The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1086/604261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility===
Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well.&lt;ref name=bloom2007&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bloom |first2=David |last2=Canning |first3=Günther |last3=Fink |first4=Jocelyn |last4=Finlay |year=2009 |title=Fertility, female labor force participation, and the demographic dividend |journal=[[Journal of Economic Growth]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[United Nation]]s data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedLIMpaper.PDF|title=Female Labour-Force Participation|author=Lin Lean Lim|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}, part of {{cite book|title=Completing the Fertility Transition|year=2009|publisher=[[United Nations]] Publications|isbn=9789211513707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn  |author2=Pedro Mira |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839 |doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;

Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt; It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable [[work–life balance]] in order to combine motherhood and employment.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C.

==History==

===19th century===
Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a [[wage]], and eventually a [[salary]], became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as "hurriers" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], an early attempt at regulating the workplace.

During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as "[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of [[London]]. [[Piecework]], which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before [[workers' compensation]] for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian [[workhouse]] to pay debts.

Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be "more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1870 US Census]] was the first United States Census to count "females engaged in each occupation" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in [[sweatshop]]s. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but [[teaching]] and the occupations of [[dressmaking]], [[Hatmaking|millinery]], and [[tailoring]] played a larger role. Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2).

===20th century===
[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|upright "[[We Can Do It!]]" by [[J. Howard Miller]].|In the United States, the "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other [[proto-feminist]] messages.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10"&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972,&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. H: "Life in the Age of Enterprise", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[World War I]] made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home.

In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, "lace-collar" jobs.&lt;ref name="Green-57"&gt;Green, E: "The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–1945", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920, [[The New York Times]] ran a head line that read: "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation"&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10" /&gt; which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.

[[World War II]] created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military:
140,000 in the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)]] WAC;
100,000 in the Navy (WAVE);
23,000 in the Marines;
14,000 in the [[Navy Nurse Corps]] and,
13,000 in the Coast Guard.
Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force.&lt;ref name="Green-57"/&gt; Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|page=22|isbn=0860919293|quote=The rate of participation of women in the labor force rose from about 28% in 1940 to 37% in 1945 and then fell to 30% in 1947.

Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/05/22/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday May 22, 1949|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era|last=May|first=Elaine Tyler|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=10–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women.

===The Quiet Revolution===

The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.

The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the "independent female worker." From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of [[marriage bars]], which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.

In the third phase, labeled the "roots of the revolution" encompassing the time from 1950– mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in "pink-collar jobs" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The [[sexual harassment]] experienced by these [[Pink-collar worker|pink collar]] workers is depicted in the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]''. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.

The fourth phase, known as the "Quiet Revolution", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like [[women in medicine|medicine]], law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-22.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=''Do Women’s and Men’s Labor Market Outcomes Differentially Affect Real Wage Growth and Inflation?''|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the [[birth control pill]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} While "the pill" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'', 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the [[age of majority]] had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the [[Vietnam War]]; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a "big bang" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldin, Claudia | title = The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education and Family | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | date = 2006 | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupational safety and health ==
Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[tendonitis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress may be due to the fact that women are often [[caregiver]]s at home and do [[contingent work]] and [[contract work]] at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is [[homicide]], which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/#2|title = Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women are at lower risk for work-related death than men. However, [[personal protective equipment]] is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment.&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential [[Toxic substance|environmental causes]] of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[insomnia]], and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for [[occupational stress]], which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:World Water Monitoring Day (4049999633).jpg|thumb|Students in [[Denver, Colorado]] conduct monitoring on the [[South Platte River]] with [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] staff on World Water Monitoring Day in 2009]]
'''World Water Monitoring Day''' was established in 2003 by America's Clean Water Foundation (ACWF) as a global [[Environmental education|educational outreach]] program. The program, subsequently named the "World Water Monitoring Challenge" and "'''EarthEcho Water Challenge'''," aims to build public awareness and involvement in protecting [[water resource]]s around the world by empowering citizens to carry out [[Water quality#Sampling and measurement|basic monitoring]] of their local water bodies.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatermonitoringday.org |title=EarthEcho Water Challenge |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=EarthEcho International |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta (Robbi) Savage, ACWF's President and CEO created WWMD, and Edward Moyer was the first WWMD Coordinator. 

A simple test kit enables everyone, children and adults, to sample local water bodies for a set of [[water quality]] parameters including temperature, acidity (pH), clarity ([[turbidity]]) and [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (DO). Information on purchasing low-cost test kits is available from the current sponsoring organization, [[EarthEcho International]], and the results of monitoring events are then shared with participating communities around the globe on the sponsor's website.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;

World Water Monitoring Day was originally celebrated annually on September 18. This date was initially chosen to be a month later (October 18) to recognize the anniversary of the US [[Clean Water Act]], which was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1972 to restore and protect the country’s water resources. In 2007, the date was changed to facilitate participation in parts of the world where temperatures reach freezing conditions at that time.

In 2006, ACWF transferred the coordination of the event to the [[Water Environment Federation]] (WEF) and the [[International Water Association]] (IWA). The collective goal was to expand participation to one million people in 100 countries by 2012. In January 2015 the management of World Water Monitoring Day was transferred to EarthEcho International.

2008 saw students from [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/25/students-take-part-water-monitoring.html?t=1227619851#comment-9070 Students take part in water monitoring], The Jakarta Post, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Arkansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecabin.net/stories/112508/sty_1125080028.shtml Environmental concerns make water protection necessary], The Cabin.net, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in water sampling to bring attention to the importance of water quality.

As of 2018, EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the "EarthEcho Water Challenge" during any period between March 22 ([[World Water Day]]) and December of each year.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;

== Background ==

Zihar was accepted as a declaration of [[divorce]] among [[pagan]] [[Arabs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Be49BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=zihar+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sKidk1zmep&amp;sig=1ZJxNWN5diGiRC-QHqxMoS9hgrw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt5LLDg4LZAhUPEVAKHcPYAmAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=zihar+encyclopedia&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Law and Local Tradition:: A Socio-Historical Approach|first=Prof Drs H. Akh Minhaji, M. A.|last=Ph.D|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Kurnia Kalam Semesta|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is mentioned in the [[Quran]] in reference to [[Khawla bint Tha'labah]], who was divorced by this formula in the chapter 58, verses 1-4:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quran.com/58/1-4|title=Surah Al-Mujadila [58:1-4]|website=Surah Al-Mujadila [58:1-4]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230437/https://quran.com/58/1-4|archivedate=2017-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''God has surely heard the words of her who pleaded with you against her husband and made her plaint to God. God has heard what you two said to each other. Surely God hears all and observes all.''&lt;br&gt;
''Those of you who divorce their wives by declaring them to be their mothers' backs should know that they are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those who bore them. The words they utter are unjust and false: but God pardons and forgives.''&lt;br&gt;

''Those that divorce their wives by so saying, and afterwards retract their words, shall free a slave before they touch each other again. This you are enjoined to do: God is cognizant of what you do. He that has no slave shall fast two successive months before they touch one another. He that cannot shall feed sixty of the destitute. Thus it is, so that you may believe in God and His apostle. Such are the bounds set by God. Woeful punishment awaits the unbelievers.''}}

== Legality ==

Zihar is [[Haram|illegal]] and considered an insult in the [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. It implies that the man, declaring his wife akin to his mother or sister, is guilty of the sin of forbidding the [[Halal|lawful]] things. It has been proscribed by law and the act does not ensue in divorce. It is detested and condemned in the law. Thus, penalties in the form of setting free a slave, fasting, or feeding the poor people have been imposed.
