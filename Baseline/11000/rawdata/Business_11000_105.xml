==Biography==

Andrónico Luksic Craig is the eldest son of [[Andrónico Luksic Abaroa|Andrónico Luksic]] and Ena Craig. He spent his early childhood years, along with his younger brother [[Guillermo Luksic Craig|Guillermo]], in the mineral deserts of northern Chile. When Andrónico was only around four years old, his mother died during a heart operation. Fourteen years after this unfortunate death, his father would marry [[Iris Fontbona]], giving birth to three new children: María Paola, María Gabriela and [[Jean-Paul Luksic Fontbona|Jean-Paul]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1960, Andrónico and his family moved to [[Santiago]], where they lived in a house at Alcántara street. In Santiago, he first attended [[The Grange School, Santiago|The Grange School]]. Then, at the age of 16, Andrónico went to the United States to attend high school at the [[Dublin School|Dublin School for Boys]] (in [[New Hampshire]]). Upon graduating, he moved to Boston to pursue a degree in business at [[Babson College]]. His tenure at [[Babson College|Babson]] was cut short when he returned to South America to work in the family's [[Ford (company)|Ford]] dealerships.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

It is the second installment in the [[Atlas Shrugged (film series)|''Atlas Shrugged'' film series]] and the first [[sequel]] to the 2011 film ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]'', continuing the story where its predecessor left off.&lt;ref name=LA20120202&gt;{{cite web |title='Atlas Shrugged Part 2' to start production in April |first=Rebecca |last=Keegan |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=February 2, 2012 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/02/atlas-shrugged-part-2-shooting-april.html |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on October 12, 2012.

==Plot==
[[Dagny Taggart]] pilots an airplane in pursuit of another plane. Dagny asks herself, "Who is [[John Galt]]?" before apparently crashing into a mountainside.

Nine months earlier, Dagny is trying to understand the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and her lover [[Hank Rearden]] have found. Scientists across the country have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances, but Dagny is able to locate Quentin Daniels, who agrees to help from an abandoned laboratory in [[Utah]].

Dagny's brother [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]], president of the family [[railroad]] company, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see a renowned pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking, "Who is John Galt?" Later, at James and Cherryl's wedding, Dagny's friend [[Francisco d'Anconia]] argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden about devastating explosions at his [[Copper extraction|copper mine]]—the next day. Rearden spends the night with Dagny. Later, he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, but when he offers a divorce she declines, in order to maintain her position in society.

Rearden sells his advanced Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger's [[coal mining]] company, but refuses to sell it to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], in defiance of the newly enacted "Fair Share" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law. Dagny barges into Danagger's office, realizes that he too is about to disappear, and understands that she is close to understanding the force behind the disappearances. At trial, Rearden defends [[Individualism|individual freedom]] and the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court, which fears turning him into a martyr. The government announces "Directive 10-289", which freezes employment and production and requires that all patents be gifted to the government. Rearden defies this decree as well, but relents when he is blackmailed with photos of himself and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation.

When Dagny hears about Rearden's "gift" and her brother's complicity, she quits the railroad. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel, due largely to political pressure by a passenger and human error by Dagny's poorly trained replacement. This impels Dagny back to her job. D'Anconia tries to dissuade her from returning, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she returns anyway.

Dagny takes a train to [[Colorado]] to show her faith in the railway, but its engine fails. The repair technician used to work for 20th Century Motor Company, which produced the motor Dagny found. He tells Dagny how the [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|need-based]] reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company vowing to "stop the motor of the world." Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane and flies to [[Utah]] to try to dissuade him, but as she is landing, she sees him get into a plane on the airstrip.

After a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by [[stealth technology]]. A wounded Dagny Taggart crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt.

==Production==
The producers intended to finance ''Part II'' using profits from ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]''. When that film failed to generate a profit, a private debt sale in early 2012 raised $16 million of the $25 million the producers sought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Atlas Shrugged: Part 2' movie funded |first=Peter |last=Key |work=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]] |date=February 6, 2012 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/peter-key/2012/02/atlas-shrugged-part-2-movie-on-the-way.html |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling a budget larger than that of the first film. There is some confusion about the relative size of the budget for the first two movies. The part 2 production budget was around $10 million and the marketing budget around $10 million, between 2010 and 2012. During the first movie a total of less than $20 million were spent over the course of the preceding 18 years. Hence, more was spent directly on producing the 2nd movie. The production company announced that Part 2 would be released to coincide with the U.S. general election season in fall 2012.&lt;ref name="LA20120202" /&gt;

Duncan Scott, who in 1986 was responsible for creating a new, re-edited version of the [[We the Living (film)|1942 Italian film adaptation]] of Ayn Rand's novel ''[[We the Living]]'' with English subtitles, joined the production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Bond |title='Atlas Shrugged Part 2' Timed to Hit Screens Just Before Presidential Election (Video) |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-part-2-prduction-april-286633 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the production company for the second film, Either Or Productions, LLC, is taken from the title Rand gave to the middle section of her novel. An April press release stated the name of the film as ''Atlas Shrugged, Part 2: Either Or.''&lt;ref name="atlas20120402" /&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began on April 2, 2012 with an all-new cast, including [[Samantha Mathis]] as the heroine [[Dagny Taggart]], [[Jason Beghe]] as the industrialist [[Henry Rearden]], and [[Esai Morales]] as the playboy [[Francisco d'Anconia]].&lt;ref name="atlas20120402"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=DeSapio |url= http://blog.atlasshruggedmovie.com/2012/04/atlas-shrugged-part-2-begins-principal.html |title=Atlas Shrugged Part 2 Begins Principal Photography |publisher=Official Atlas Shrugged Movie Blog |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer John Aglialoro has implied that hiring the cast of Part I for the sequel exceeded the movie's budget, saying "it's hard to lock people down", and also noting that [[Taylor Schilling]], the actress who played Dagny in Part I, is "a bona fide movie star now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 53 Percent Shrugged |last=Weigel |first=David |authorlink=David Weigel |date=September 20, 2012 |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/creators_of_the_new_atlas_shrugged_ii_film_believe_it_speaks_to_mitt_romney_s_critique_of_47_percent_of_americans_.2.html |work=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report before the film was released, the film was to be on a 31-day shooting schedule, four days more than that of the first movie, and to undergo two months of post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= On the Set of Atlas Shrugged Part II |url= http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/20/on-the-set-of-atlas-shrugged-part-ii |publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' |first= Brian |last= Doherty |authorlink= Brian Doherty (journalist) |date= April 20, 2012 |accessdate= April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' was not [[film screening|screen]]ed for critics before its release, with producer John Aglialoro questioning "the integrity of the critics".&lt;ref name="FNC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/12/atlas-shrugged-part-ii-kept-from-mainstream-movie-critics-but-public-interest/ |title='Atlas Shrugged: Part II' kept from mainstream movie critics, but public interest remains high |last=McKay |first=Hollie |date=October 12, 2012 |work=[[FoxNews.com]] |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was screened for the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think-tank [[The Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

===Box office===

''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' opened on 1,012 screens and earned [[USD|$]]692,000 on its premiere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/363039/atlas-shrugged-part-2-falters-at-the-north-american-box-office/ |title=‘Atlas Shrugged Part 2′ Falters At The North American Box Office |publisher=''The Inquisitr'' |date=October 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $1.7 million its opening weekend, debuting at #11. Despite opening on more than three times the screens of ''Part I'', it did not significantly improve on ''Part I'''s opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2012&amp;wknd=40 |title=Weekend Box Office Results for October 5-7, 2012 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82399.html?hp=r7 |title=The box office shrugs at 'Atlas' |first=Patrick |last=Gavin |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.altfg.com/blog/movie/atlas-shrugged-part-2-box-office-samantha-mathis/ |first=Zac |last=Gille |title=One of Worst Opening Weekends Ever at Domestic Box Office: ''Atlas Shrugged Part 2 |publisher=Alt Film Guie |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The box office take totaled $3,286,255 through November 4, 2012, the last date for which the producers released numbers. When adjusted for inflation, the film had one of the two hundred least profitable wide openings of the past thirty years, followed by one of the two hundred largest week-over-week drops recorded for the same period. By the third week of release it was down to under 150 screens, taking in under $100,000 on its third weekend.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 4% based on reviews from 23 professional critics, with an average score of 3/10, and the site's consensus is: "Poorly written, clumsily filmed and edited, and hampered by amateurish acting, ''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' does no favors to the ideology it so fervently champions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_ii/ |title= Atlas Shrugged: Part II (2012) |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 26 based on 11 reviews, which is interpreted as "Generally unfavorable" by Metacritic.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas Shrugged Part 2 |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlas-shrugged-part-2 |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]]| work = [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics were not impressed with the film based on several reviews: reviewer Danny Baldwin gave the film a "D" rating;&lt;ref name="CS-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Danny |title=Review: "Atlas Shrugged: Part II – The Strike" |url=http://www.criticspeak.com/review-atlas-shrugged-part-ii/ |date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=''CriticSpeak'' |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Post]]'''s Kyle Smith gave the film a "1" rating (of 4), saying "...even if you overlooked the production values from a 1986 porno and special effects like something your nephew cooked up on his Mac, the movie's "Yay, money!" zingers are just a big bag of sad."&lt;ref name="NYPost-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kyle |title=Saw the film &amp; shrugged |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/saw_the_film_shrugged_fJIj4XwcW2XB6eW0TScgRI |date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |accessdate=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of [[The A.V.

Economics columnist John Tamny of [[Forbes.com]] gave the film a positive review and argued that it is "a must see because it in a very handsome way describes the world in which we live today whereby the achievers are being shackled by the moochers."'''''&lt;ref name="JTF"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2012/10/07/movie-review-why-atlas-shrugged-part-ii-is-a-must-see-film/ |title=Why Atlas Shrugged, Part II Is a Must See Film |last=Tamny |first=John |date=October 7, 2012 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

In 1974 ''Sisamo'' Studio Kairos, 1979 ''Le Bambole'' Mario Bellini, 1987 ''Sity'' Antonio Citterio and in 1989 B&amp;B Italia became the first company to be recognized with a Compasso d'oro directly awarded to a design manufacturing company.  Since 1966 there have been over 1000 B&amp;B Italia designs (including prototypes).

Over 3% of B&amp;B Italia's annual sales is reinvested in research and development.  In 2010 a foaming department for upholstery was established with an investment of 4 million Euro.

Banktivity, formerly known as iBank is a personal finance management suite designed for macOS and iOS platforms by IGG Software and debuted in 2003 as a Mac desktop software. There have been a total of 6 releases for the desktop version since its inception. Over this same period, [[IGG Software|IGG Software Inc.]] also released iOS versions for the iPhone (2009) and the iPad (2012) and Apple Watch. Features differ between the apps, specifically the lack of reporting on the iPhone version.

In February 2016 IGG Software officially dropped the iBank name and rebranded as Banktivity. The name was derived from "Bank" and "Activity"according to IGG Software's president Ian Gillespie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mactrast.com/2016/02/igg-software-renames-popular-ibank-personal-finance-app-to-banktivity/|title=IGG Software Renames Popular 'iBank' Personal Finance App to 'Banktivity'|date=3 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionarypar|changeover}} 
In [[manufacturing]], '''changeover''' is the [[wikt:process|process]] of converting a line or machine from running one product to another. Changeover times can last from a few minutes to as much as several weeks in the case of [[automobile]] manufacturers retooling for new models. The terms ''set-up'' and ''changeover'' are sometimes used interchangeably however this usage is incorrect. Set-up is only one component of changeover. Example: A [[soft drink]] [[bottling|bottler]] may run 16oz glass bottles one day, perform a changeover on the line and then run 20oz plastic bottles the next day.

== The 3 Ups ==
Changeover can be divided into the 3 Ups:

===Clean-up===
''Clean-up [[product (business)|product]], materials and [[wikt:component|component]]s from the line. It may range from minor, if only the [[label]] of a package is being changed (for example from an [[English language|English]] to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] label) to major, requiring complete disassembly of the equipment, cleaning and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] of the line components in the case of an injectable pharmaceutical product.

===Set-up===
''Set-up'' is the process of actually converting the equipment. This may be achieved by adjusting the equipment to correspond to the next product or by changing non-adjustable "change parts" to accommodate the product. Typically it will be a combination of both. 

===Start-up===
''Start-up'' is the time spent fine tuning the equipment after it has been restarted. It is characterized by frequent stoppages, jams, quality rejects and other problems. It is generally caused by variability in the clean-up and set-up or by variability in the product or its components.

The '''chief diversity officer''' ('''CDO''') is an organization’s executive level [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] strategist. Roughly 20% percent of [[Fortune 500]] companies employ diversity officers.&lt;ref name="Asianews" /&gt;

== Historical background ==
The chief diversity officer serves in an executive level leadership role. According to [[Billy E. Vaughn]], a history of cultural diversity pioneer work conducted by university professors, cultural diversity consultants, and human resource officers precedes the chief diversity officer.&lt;ref name="http://diversityofficermagazine.com/magazine/?page_id=65"&gt;[http://diversityofficermagazine.com/magazine/?page_id=65 The History of Diversity Training &amp; Its Pioneers]&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 20 percent of Fortune 500 companies employed diversity officers in 2005, but that number has grown considerably since then.&lt;ref name="Asianews"&gt;[http://news.asianweek.com/news/ Are Diversity Officers Changing the Face of Corporate America?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129103815/http://news.asianweek.com/news/ |date=November 29, 2009 }} News Analysis, Bill Picture,
Asian Week, Nov 26, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently has there been a discussion about the appropriate background education and credentials the diversity officer needs. In the business sector, the role remains tied to human resource management functions. Higher education chief diversity officers tend to have doctoral degrees.

== Credentialing ==
{{peacock|date=March 2018}}
Diversity Certification refers to credential training that empowers professionals with the techniques, skills, and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Diversity Jobs. What is diversity &amp; inclusion certification? Diversity Officer Magazine, (May 2018). https://www.diversityofficermagazine.com/diversityjobs/category/blog/ &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Diversity Executive Leadership Academy (n.d.). What is diversity certification? - CDP CDT CDE. https://diversityexecutiveacademy.com/what-is-diversity-certification-cdp-cdt-cde/&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting expertise drives their career in consulting, training, and managing diversity. The credential training is still in its infancy. &lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, B.E. (2007), The history of diversity training and its pioneers. Strategic Diversity &amp; Inclusion Management Magazine, pp. 11 - 16, Vol. 1, Issue 1, Spring. https://diversityofficermagazine.com/diversity-inclusion/the-history-of-diversity-training-its-pioneers/&lt;/ref&gt; Training prepares individuals to serve in the cultural diversity profession role. A cultural diversity practitioner has expertise in managing and leading programs designed to foster productive relationships among people of different cultures.

Diversity Training University International (DTUI) offered the first cultural diversity professional (CDP) and cultural diversity trainer (CDT) credentialing program in 1998. &lt;ref&gt;Diversity Jobs. What is diversity &amp; inclusion certification? Diversity Officer Magazine, (May 2018). https://www.diversityofficermagazine.com/diversityjobs/category/blog/ &lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first organization to offer a specialization in cultural diversity management expertise. Cornell University offered a certificate specialization about the same year. The National Training Laboratory (NTL) also offered a certificate program. Cornell University now offers a certificate program and the CCDP credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, B.E. (2007), The history of diversity training and its pioneers. Strategic Diversity &amp; Inclusion Management Magazine, pp. 11 - 16, Vol. 1, Issue 1, Spring. https://diversityofficermagazine.com/diversity-inclusion/the-history-of-diversity-training-its-pioneers/&lt;/ref&gt;

A good credentialing program will offer professionals new to the role the competence needed to succeed. The training takes seasoned professionals to the next performance level by building on existing competencies and providing credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Lejonhuvud, L. (n.d.) Selecting a diversity professional credentialing program. Diversity Officer Magazine, https://diversityofficermagazine.com/diversity-professional/diversity-cerification-program-review/&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive, well designed credentialing program is backed by a body of knowledge collected from leaders in the field, evidenced-based techniques and tools, a strategic framework, leadership competency, and training skills.&lt;ref&gt;Diversity Executive Leadership Academy z9n.d.). What makes the diversity leadership programs standout? Frequently Asked Questions. https://diversityexecutiveacademy.com/faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Requiring quality training and certification promotes the reputation of certified diversity professional experts as is essential to a high performing organization. A high impact diversity certification program teaches how to lead a high performing inclusion initiative, develop solutions based on needs analysis and business acumen, leverage technology to enhance organizational learning and much more. The best quality Diversity Certification programs include a common language to unify the cultural diversity and inclusion industry.

The '''Coalition for Change''' was a presidential and parliamentary electoral coalition that groups the supporters of President [[Sebastián Piñera]] for the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009–2010|2009-2010 Chilean election]]. Its predecessor was the [[Alliance for Chile]] (''Alianza por Chile''). The constituent parties are the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (''Unión Demócrata Independiente''), [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (''Renovación Nacional''), [[Liberal Party (Chile, 2007–)|ChileFirst]] (''ChilePrimero''), the movements Grand North (''Norte Grande''), and [[Christian Humanism]] (''Humanista Cristiano''). This coalition speech aspired to leave behind divisions that have polarized Chilean society, and his objective was to work together for the future of Chile by creating a democracy representative of the diverse creeds with respect, tolerance and friendship. ''&lt;ref name="El Maule"&gt;{{es icon}} El Maule [http://www.elamaule.cl/admin/render/noticia/21222 Nace la Coalición por el Cambio]&lt;/ref&gt;''

==History==
After his separation from the [[Concert of Parties for Democracy]] (''Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia'') and having founded the political movement [[ChileFirst]], Senator [[Fernando Flores]] integrated the independent platform next to Carlos Cantero, who renounced from [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] to found the Movement Grand North; [[Carlos Bianchi]]; and [[Adolfo Zaldívar]], ex Christian-democrat with close ties to the Regionalist Party of the Independents (''Partido Regionalista de los Independientes'').

This group of [[Senate of Chile|senators]] was key in proposing the coalition of [[right-wing]] [[Alliance for Chile]], as in the destitution of the Minister [[Yasna Provoste]]&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} La Tercera [http://www.latercera.cl/contenido/23_4212_9.shtml Yasna Provoste: Auge y caída de una ministra]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[embezzlement]] and in the naming of Jovino Novoa (UDI) as the president of the [[Senate of Chile|Chilean Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} La Nacion, [http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090308/pags/20090308182333.html Duro emplazamiento de Escalona por Jovino Novoa]&lt;/ref&gt;

After having joined the list "Clean Chile. Happy Vote" (''Chile Limpio. Vote Feliz'', formerly ''Por Un Chile Limpio''), a separation was generated between the founding members of ChileFirst in respect to the position the party would take before the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2009. Meanwhile, Jorge Schaulsohn and Fernando Flores supported the candidate of the Alliance for Chile [[Sebastián Piñera]], [[Esteban Valenzuela]], also a member of parliament, rejected the union with the center-right and renounced ChileFirst in order to support [[Marco Enríquez-Ominami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} La Nacion [http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090330/pags/20090330131648.html  Valenzuela dejó Chile Primero por apoyo a Piñera ]&lt;/ref&gt; The support for Sebastián Piñera by the part of ChilePrimero was made official on May 6, 2009, the same day the Coalition for Change itself became official, joining the Alliance for Chile, ChileFirst and other minor political movements.

For the 2009-2010 presidential elections, the candidate for the Coalition for Change, Sebastián Piñera, won the first round with more than 44% of the votes.  During the run-off election, Sebastián Piñera won with 51.61% of the Chilean vote, with which he succeeded in retaining the presidency for the period of 2010-2014. Piñera took the presidential oath on March 11, 2010.

In 2013, the coalition was composed only of the National Renewal and the Independent Democratic Union. That same year, regained its old name "Alliance" to participate in the presidential primaries.

{{Business administration}}

'''Corporate governance''' is the mechanisms, processes and relations by which [[corporation]]s are controlled and directed.&lt;ref&gt;Shailer, Greg. ''An Introduction to Corporate Governance in Australia'', Pearson Education Australia, Sydney, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Governance structures and principles identify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives, 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social, regulatory and market environment. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. Corporate governance practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/oecdprinciplesofcorporategovernance.htm|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Adrian, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the corporate governance practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001–2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis in 2008]].

[[Corporate scandals]] of various forms have maintained public and political interest in the [[regulation]] of corporate governance. In the U.S., these include [[Enron]] and [[MCI Inc.]] (formerly WorldCom). Their demise led to the enactment of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, a [[U.S. federal law]] intended to restore public confidence in corporate governance. Comparable failures in Australia ([[HIH Insurance|HIH]], [[One.Tel]]) are associated with the eventual passage of the [[CLERP 9]] reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Janet &amp; Shailer, Greg. The Effect of Board-Related Reforms on Investors Confidence. ''Australian Accounting Review'', 18(45) 2008: 123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest (e.g., [[Parmalat]] in Italy).

==Stakeholder interests==
In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debtholders, trade [[creditor]]s and suppliers, customers, and communities affected by the corporation's activities. Internal stakeholders are the [[board of directors]], [[Executive (management)|executives]], and other employees.

Much of the contemporary interest in corporate governance is concerned with mitigation of the [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] between stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, International Corporate Governance, (Prentice Hall 2012) {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large firms where there is a separation of ownership and management and no controlling shareholder, the [[principal–agent problem|principal–agent issue]] arises between upper-management (the "agent") which may have very different interests, and by definition considerably more information, than shareholders (the "principals"). The danger arises that, rather than overseeing management on behalf of shareholders, the board of directors may become insulated from shareholders and beholden to management.&lt;ref&gt;Pay Without Performance – the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect is particularly present in contemporary public debates and developments in regulatory [[policy]].&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; More explicitly, the danger is that executives paid by stock option have incentive to divert the retained earnings of the firm into buying shares of own company stock, which will then cause the share price to rise.  However, retained earnings will then not be used to purchase the latest equipment or to hire quality people. Over the thirty or forty years that the model has been in place, the diversion of retained earnings to stock price manipulation has gradually eroded the competitiveness of the US industrial base.  While the public blames low wages in China for eliminating US jobs, the reality is that many US firms compete with high wage nations such as Canada, Germany, or Japan.  It is failure of large publicly-held corporations to invest in new equipment and people that holds the US back and erodes the middle class (fewer engineers, chemists, CNC machinists, accountants are needed as plants are left to age out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/36211184/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_Part_2_Rising_Asset_Bubbles_Distort_the_Industrial_Base; see also https://www.npr.org/2017/02/06/513713606/glass-house-chronicles-the-sharp-decline-of-an-all-american-factory-town; see also https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions which affect the way a company is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Financial Times Lexicon|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=corporate-governance|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme of governance is the nature and extent of [[corporate accountability]]. A related discussion at the macro level focuses on the effect of a corporate governance system on [[economic efficiency]], with a strong emphasis on shareholders' welfare.&lt;ref name="DainesKlausner"&gt;Daines, Robert, and [[Michael Klausner]], 2008 "corporate law, economic analysis of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

==Other definitions==
Corporate governance has also been more narrowly defined as "a system of law and sound approaches by which corporations are directed and controlled focusing on the internal and external corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the actions of management and directors and thereby, mitigating agency risks which may stem from the misdeeds of corporate officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sifuna|first=Anazett Pacy|title=Disclose or Abstain: The Prohibition of Insider Trading on Trial|journal=Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation|year=2012|volume=27|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate governance has also been defined as "Is the act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating a corporation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/corporate-governance |title=Corporate Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to the definition of Governance as "The act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating an entity, process or resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/governance |title=Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, governance and corporate governance are different from management because governance must be EXTERNAL to the object being governed. Governing agents do not have personal control over, and are not part of the object that they govern. For example, it is not possible for a CIO to govern the IT function. They are personally accountable for the strategy and management of the function. As such, they “manage” the IT function; they do not “govern” it. At the same time, there may be a number of policies, authorized by the board, that the CIO follows. When the CIO is following these policies, they are performing “governance” activities because the primary intention of the policy is to serve a governance purpose. The board is ultimately “governing” the IT function because they stand outside of the function and are only able to externally direct, control and evaluate the IT function by virtue of established policies, procedures and indicators. Without these policies, procedures and indicators, the board has no way of governing, let alone affecting the IT function in any way.

==Principles==
Contemporary discussions of corporate governance tend to refer to principles raised in three documents released since 1990: The [[Cadbury Report]] (UK, 1992), the Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 1999, 2004 and 2015), and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 (US, 2002).  The Cadbury and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) reports present general principles around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox, is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports.
* '''Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles II and III|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial service Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights. They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings.
* '''Interests of other stakeholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Preamble and Article IV|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should recognize that they have legal, contractual, social, and market driven obligations to non-shareholder stakeholders, including employees, investors, creditors, suppliers, local communities, customers, and policy makers.
* '''Role and responsibilities of the board''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Article VI|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.4&lt;/ref&gt; The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.
* '''Integrity and ethical behavior''':&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.33, 4.51 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title I, 101(c)(1), Title VIII, and Title IX, 406&lt;/ref&gt; Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members.  Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making.
* '''Disclosure and transparency''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principals of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles I and V|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability. They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company's financial reporting. Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear, factual information.

==Models==
Different models of corporate governance differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded. The Anglo-American "model" tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders. The coordinated or [[multistakeholder model]] associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers, managers, suppliers, customers, and the community. A related distinction is between market-oriented and network-oriented models of corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;[Sytse Douma] &amp; [Hein Schreuder] (2013) ''[http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page Economic Approaches to Organizations]'', 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe (Two-tier board system) ===
{{main article|Aktiengesellschaft}}
Some continental European countries, including Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, require a two-tiered board of directors as a means of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Bob, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide, Second Edition'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two-tiered board, the executive board, made up of company executives, generally runs day-to-day operations while the supervisory board, made up entirely of non-executive directors who represent shareholders and employees, hires and fires the members of the executive board, determines their compensation, and reviews major business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hopt, Klaus J., "The German Two-Tier Board (Aufsichtsrat), A German View on Corporate Governance" in Hopt, Klaus J. and Wymeersch, Eddy (eds), ''Comparative Corporate Governance: Essays and Materials'', de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, {{ISBN|3-11-015765-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance defines corporate governance as the "acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders. It is about commitment to values, about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal  &amp; corporate funds in the management of a company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance, February 2003|url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|work=[[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance|accessdate=2011-07-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928135443/http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mia Mahmudur Rahim|author2=Sanjaya Kuruppu|editor1-last=Franklin|editor1-first=Ngwu|editor2-last=Onyeka|editor2-first=Osuji|editor3-last=Frank|editor3-first=Stephen|title=Corporate Governance in Developing and Emerging Markets|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9781315666020|chapter=Corporate Governance in India: The Potential for Ghandism}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is a growing economy and it is quite important to safeguard the interests of investors and also ensure that the responsibility of management is fixed. The Satyam scandal, also known as India's Enron, wiped off billions of shareholders' wealth and threatened foreign investment in India. This is the reason that corporate governance in India has taken the centre stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIRA006061.pdf Advantages of Corporate Governance for Indian Enterprises], By Shailendra Sial.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States, United Kingdom===
The so-called "Anglo-American model" of corporate governance emphasizes the interests of shareholders. It relies on a single-tiered board of directors that is normally dominated by non-executive directors elected by shareholders. Because of this, it is also known as "the unitary system".&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallin, Christine A., "Corporate Governance Developments in the UK" in Mallin, Christine A (ed), ''Handbook on International Corporate Governance: Country Analyses, Second Edition'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84980-123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this system, many boards include some executives from the company (who are [[ex officio]] members of the board). Non-executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts, including audit and compensation committees. In the United Kingdom, the [[CEO]] generally does not also serve as Chairman of the Board, whereas in the US having the dual role has been the norm, despite major misgivings regarding the effect on corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, William G, ''The Board Book: An Insider's Guide for Directors and Trustees'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York &amp; London, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-393-06645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of US firms combining both roles is declining, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russellreynolds.com/newsroom/splitting-the-ceo-and-chairman-roles-yes-or-no&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, corporations are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) is governed by federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004&gt;Bebchuck LA. (2004).[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=387940 The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power].''Harvard Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual rules for corporations are based upon the [[corporate charter]] and, less authoritatively, the corporate [[bylaw]]s.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;
Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;

It is sometimes colloquially stated that in the USA and the UK 'the shareholders own the company'. This is, however, a misconception as argued by Eccles &amp; Youmans (2015) and Kay (2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/materiality-in-corporate-governance-the-statement-of-significant-audiences-and-materiality; https://next.ft.com/content/7bd1b20a-879b-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder centrism===
Recent scholarship from the [[University of Oxford]] outlines a new theory of corporate governance, founder centrism, which is premised upon a narrowing in the separation between ownership and control. Through the lens of concentrated equity ownership theory, a new theory of the firm, the traditional checklist of best practices are inapplicable, as evidenced by the significant outperformance of technology companies with dual-class share structures and integrated CEO/Chairman positions:

{{Cquote|
"Founder-run companies, such as Facebook, Netflix and Google are at the forefront of a new wave of organizational structure better suited to long-term value creation. Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within CEO theory, integrates the capacity of founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an owner’s mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J. Watson Sr. and Thomas Watson Jr. with IBM, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook with Apple, Jamie Dimon with JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd Blankfein with Goldman Sachs, Rick George with Suncor Energy, and many others. In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism – leaders with a founder’s mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation without enslavement to a quarter-by-quarter upward growth trajectory. In traditionally structured firms, high performing executives gain deference, become highly influential, and take on the qualities of concentrated equity owners. To the extent these leaders embrace founder centrism, their companies will experience efficiency advantages relative to competitors operating within traditional parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Claudio|title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership|publisher=The University of Oxford|accessdate=June 27, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;|100%|cquote}}

An article published by the Australian Institute of Company Directors called 'Do Boards Need to become more Entrepreneurial?' written by Nigel Hennessy FAICD also considered the need for Founder Centrism behaviour at board level to appropriately manage disruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hennessy|first1=Nigel|title=Do boards need to become more Entrepreneurial|url=http://www.aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/advocacy/governance-leadership-centre/pdf/the-entrepreneurial-board.ashx|publisher=AICD|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Corporations are created as [[legal person]]s by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation's legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to [[common law]] in some countries, and various laws and regulations affecting business practices. In most jurisdictions, corporations also have a constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision-makers. This constitution is identified by a variety of terms; in English-speaking jurisdictions, it is usually known as the Corporate Charter or the [[memorandum of association|Memorandum]] and Articles of Association. The capacity of shareholders to modify the constitution of their corporation can vary substantially.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The U.S. passed the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) in 1977, with subsequent modifications. This law made it illegal to bribe government officials and required corporations to maintain adequate accounting controls. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Substantial civil and criminal penalties have been levied on corporations and executives convicted of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/guidance/ DOJ Website – Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance – May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK passed the [[Bribery Act 2010|Bribery Act]] in 2010. This law made it illegal to bribe either government or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform their routine duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 was enacted in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate scandals. It established a series of requirements that affect corporate governance in the U.S. and influenced similar laws in many other countries.  The law required, along with many other elements, that:
* The [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) be established to regulate the auditing profession, which had been self-regulated prior to the law. Auditors are responsible for reviewing the financial statements of corporations and issuing an opinion as to their reliability.
* The [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) and [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) attest to the financial statements. Prior to the law, CEOs had claimed in court they hadn't reviewed the information as part of their defense.
* Board audit committees have members that are independent and disclose whether or not at least one is a financial expert, or reasons why no such expert is on the audit committee.
* External audit firms cannot provide certain types of consulting services and must rotate their lead partner every 5 years. Further, an audit firm cannot audit a company if those in specified senior management roles worked for the auditor in the past year. Prior to the law, there was the real or perceived conflict of interest between providing an independent opinion on the accuracy and reliability of financial statements when the same firm was also providing lucrative consulting services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/pdf/PLAW-107publ204.pdf Text of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes and guidelines==
Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges, corporations, institutional investors, or associations (institutes) of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations. As a rule, compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law, although the codes linked to stock exchange [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] may have a coercive effect.

===Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles===
One of the most influential guidelines on corporate governance are the [[G20]]/[[OECD]] Principles of Corporate Governance, first published as the OECD Principles in 1999, revised in 2004 and revised again and endorsed by the G20 in 2015.&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt; The Principles are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines. Building on the work of the OECD, other international organizations, private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes formed  the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting]] (ISAR) to produce their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/iteteb20063_en.pdf Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.]&lt;/ref&gt; This internationally agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/c2isard31_en.pdf TD/B/COM.2/ISAR/31&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standards of Accounting and Reporting, Corporate Governance Disclosure |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |work=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123092039/http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Auditing
* Board and management structure and process
* Corporate responsibility and compliance in organization
* Financial transparency and information disclosure
* Ownership structure and exercise of control rights

The [http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/guidelines-corporate-governance-soes.htm OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises] are complementary to the [http://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance.htm G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance], providing guidance tailored to the corporate governance challenges unique to [[state-owned enterprise]]s.

===Stock exchange listing standards===
Companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and other stock exchanges are required to meet certain governance standards. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among many other elements:
* Independent directors: "Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors...Effective boards of directors exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. Requiring a majority of independent directors will increase the quality of board oversight and lessen the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest." (Section 303A.01) An independent director is not part of management and has no "material financial relationship" with the company.
* Board meetings that exclude management: "To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management." (Section 303A.03)
* Boards organize their members into committees with specific responsibilities per defined charters. "Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors." This committee is responsible for nominating new members for the board of directors. Compensation and Audit Committees are also specified, with the latter subject to a variety of listing standards as well as outside regulations.

===Other guidelines===
The investor-led organisation International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) was set up by individuals centered around the ten largest pension funds in the world 1995. The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards. The network is led by investors that manage 18 trillion dollars, and members are located in fifty different countries. ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) has done work on corporate governance, particularly on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515141435/http%3A//www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID%3D80%26NoSearchContextKey%3Dtrue Accounting and Reporting], and in 2004 released [https://archive.is/20140625080626/http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID=15610&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Issue Management Tool: Strategic challenges for business in the use of corporate responsibility codes, standards, and frameworks]. This document offers general information and a perspective from a business association/think-tank on a few key codes, standards and frameworks relevant to the sustainability agenda.

In 2009, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report, [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/Corporate_Governance/Corporate_Governance_IFC_UNGC.pdf Corporate Governance - the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business], linking the environmental, social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long-term sustainability.

Most codes are largely voluntary. An issue raised in the U.S. since the 2005 Disney decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf The Disney Decision of 2005 and the precedent it sets for corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility, Kuckreja, Akin Gump, Aug 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615105810/http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice.  For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary, but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Early history ===
{{More information|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}
The modern practice of corporate governance has its roots in the 17th-century [[Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Frentrop, Paul: ''A History of Corporate Governance, 1602–2002''. (Brussels: Deminor, 2003, {{ISBN|9090170677}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Jong, Abe; Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost (2010). “An Admiralty for Asia: Isaac le Maire and Conflicting Conceptions About the Corporate Governance of the VOC”.

(Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|0415716179}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===
[[Robert E. Wright]] argues in ''Corporation Nation'' (2014) that the governance of early U.S. corporations, of which over 20,000 existed by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of 1861-1865, was superior to that of corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because early corporations governed themselves like "republics", replete with numerous "checks and balances" against fraud and against usurpation of power by managers or by large shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, Corporation Nation (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; (The term [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber baron"]] became particularly associated with US corporate figures in the [[Gilded Age]] - the late 19th century.)

In the immediate aftermath of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] legal scholars such as [[Adolf Augustus Berle]], Edwin Dodd, and [[Gardiner C. Means]] pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Berle and Means' ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', (1932, Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Chicago school of economics]], [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Coase, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt;

US economic expansion through the emergence of multinational corporations after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] (1939-1945) saw the establishment of the [[managerial class]]. Several [[Harvard Business School]] management professors studied and wrote about the new class: [[Myles Mace]] (entrepreneurship), [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (business history), [[Jay Lorsch]] (organizational behavior) and Elizabeth MacIver (organizational behavior). According to Lorsch and MacIver "many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the 1980s, [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] ''The Separation of Ownership and Control'', (1983, Journal of Law and Economics)&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[principal–agent problem]] as a way of understanding corporate governance: the firm is seen as a series of contracts.&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1989 article by [[Kathleen Eisenhardt]]: "Agency theory: an assessment and review", ''Academy of Management Review'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 1977 to 1997, corporate directors' duties in the U.S. expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Curtis J. (2007). The Reform of Corporate Governance: Major Trends in the U.S. Corporate Boardroom, 1977–1997. doctoral dissertation, Capella University.  {{cite web |url=http://xceo.net/about_us/crawford_dissertation.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517010633/http://xceo.net/about_us/crawford_dissertation.cfm |archivedate=2016-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{vague|date=October 2012}}

In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of corporate governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Honeywell]]) by their boards. The [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)]] led a wave of ''institutional'' shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently [[Options backdating|back-dated]]).

In the early 2000s, the massive bankruptcies (and criminal malfeasance) of [[Enron]] and [[Worldcom]], as well as lesser [[corporate scandals]] (such as those involving [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Communications]], [[AOL]], [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Global Crossing]], and [[Tyco International|Tyco]]) led to increased political interest in corporate governance. This was reflected in the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002. Other triggers for continued interest in the corporate governance of organizations included the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis of 2008/9]] and the level of CEO pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steven N. Kaplan, Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance in the U.S.: Perceptions, Facts and Challenges, Chicago Booth Paper No. 12-42, Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, Chicago, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
In 1997 the [[East Asian Financial Crisis]] severely affected the economies of [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]] through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed. The lack of corporate governance mechanisms in these countries highlighted the weaknesses of the institutions in their economies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}



===Saudi Arabia===
In November 2006 the [[Capital Market Authority (Saudi Arabia)]] (CMA) issued a corporate governance code in the [[Arabic language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adel Al-Hussain|Al-Hussain]], A. (2009). Corporate governance structure efficiency and bank performance in [[Saudi Arabia]] (Order No. 3357430).  from http://search.proquest.com/docview/305122134&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] has made considerable progress with respect to the implementation of viable and culturally appropriate governance mechanisms ([[Adel Al-Hussain|Al-Hussain]] &amp; Johnson, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = C. | last2 = Diyab | first2 = A. | last3 = Al-Kahtani | first3 = A. | year = 2013 | title = A cross-national analysis of perceptions of corporate governance principles | url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0969593112000546/1-s2.0-S0969593112000546-main.pdf?_tid=1b504a8c-85e2-11e5-8726-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1446964367_a56a45e973df71efb55816f230ce1496 | journal = [[International Business Review]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 315–325 | doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2012.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=April 2016}}

[[Adel Al-Hussain|Al-Hussain]], A. and Johnson, R. (2009) found a strong relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and [[Saudi]] bank performance when using [[return on assets]] as a performance measure with one exception - that government and local ownership groups were not significant. However, using [[stock return]] as a performance measure revealed a weak positive relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and bank performance.&lt;ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==
Key parties involved in corporate governance include stakeholders such as the board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and the community at large also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders' best (joint) interests. Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers' incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In private for-profit corporations, shareholders elect the board of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a 'self-perpetuating' board.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, George W., Corporate Governance Without Shareholders: A Cautionary Lesson from Non-Profit Organizations (2014). Delaware Journal of Corporate Law (DJCL), Vol. 39, No. 1, 2014; Case Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-34. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2481646 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the executive management, principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/2YHV-KXNR|title=Why Nonprofits Have a Board Problem - HBS Working Knowledge - Harvard Business School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Harvard Business School|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities of the board of directors===
Former Chairman of the Board of [[General Motors]] John G. Smale wrote in 1995: "The board is responsible for the successful perpetuation of the corporation.  That responsibility cannot be relegated to management."&lt;ref name="HBRGov1"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Harvard Business Review
| first = HBR
| year = 2000
| title = HBR on Corporate Governance | publisher = Harvard Business School Press
| isbn = 1-57851-237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[board of directors]] is expected to play a key role in corporate governance. The board has responsibility for: CEO selection and succession; providing feedback to management on the organization's strategy; compensating senior executives; monitoring financial health, performance and risk; and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities. Boards typically have several committees (e.g., Compensation, Nominating and Audit) to perform their work.&lt;ref name="Charan 2005"&gt;{{cite book

| title = Boards that Deliver | publisher = Jossey-Bass
| isbn = 0-7879-7139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2004) describe the responsibilities of the board; some of these are summarized below:&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;
* Board members should be informed and act ethically and in good faith, with due diligence and care, in the best interest of the company and the shareholders.
* Review and guide corporate strategy, objective setting, major plans of action, risk policy, capital plans, and annual budgets.
* Oversee major acquisitions and divestitures.
* Select, compensate, monitor and replace key executives and oversee succession planning.
* Align key executive and board remuneration (pay) with the longer-term interests of the company and its shareholders.
* Ensure a formal and transparent board member nomination and election process.
* Ensure the integrity of the corporation's accounting and financial reporting systems, including their independent audit.
* Ensure appropriate systems of internal control are established.
* Oversee the process of disclosure and communications.
* Where committees of the board are established, their mandate, composition and working procedures should be well-defined and disclosed.

===Stakeholder interests===
All parties to corporate governance have an interest, whether direct or indirect, in the [[financial performance]] of the corporation. Directors, workers and management receive salaries, benefits and reputation, while investors expect to receive financial returns. For lenders, it is specified interest payments, while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock. Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality; suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services, and possible continued trading relationships. These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial, physical, human and other forms of capital. Many parties may also be concerned with [[corporate social responsibility|corporate social performance]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A key factor in a party's decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

===’Absentee landlords’ vs. capital stewards===
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]]  experts insist that “institutional asset owners now seem more eager to take to task [the] negligent CEOs” of the companies whose shares they own.&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development is part of a broader trend towards more fully exercised asset ownership – notably from the part of the [[board of directors|boards of directors]] (‘trustees’) of large UK, Dutch, Scandinavian and Canadian pension investors:

: “No longer ‘[[absentee landlords]]’, {{bracket|[[pension fund]]}} trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Benelux]] and [[America]]: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups […] to ‘shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment’.”&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American,] UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In Britain, “The widespread social disenchantment that followed the [2008-2012] [[great recession]] had an impact” on all stakeholders, including [[pension fund]] board members and investment managers.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the UK’s largest pension funds are thus already active stewards of their assets, engaging with [[corporate board]]s and speaking up when they think it is necessary.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control and ownership structures===
Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e.g. '''dual-class shares''', '''ownership pyramids''', '''voting coalitions''', '''proxy votes''' and '''clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders'''.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, Chapter 3, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"/&gt; Researchers often "measure" control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving [[corporate group]]s include pyramids, [[cross ownership|cross-shareholdings]], rings, and webs. German "concerns" (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese [[keiretsu]] (系列) and South Korean [[chaebol]] (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding is an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1397.html]. Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.

====Family control====
Family interests dominate ownership and control structures of some corporations, and it has been suggested that the oversight of family-controlled corporations are superior to corporations "controlled" by institutional investors (or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management). A recent study by Credit Suisse found that companies in which "founding families retain a stake of more than 10% of the company's capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectorial peers." Since 1996, this superior performance amounts to 8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ Error 404&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111151350/http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ |date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forget the celebrity CEO.

====Diffuse shareholders====
The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries. In developed Anglo-American countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K., U.S.), institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations. While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations, these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with-on group.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The largest pools of invested money (such as the mutual fund '[[Vanguard 500]]', or the largest investment management firm for corporations, [[State Street Corp.]]) are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient [[liquidity]]. The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm [[financial risk|financial]] or other risk. A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a  particular corporation. It is often assumed that, if institutional investors pressing for changes decide they will likely be costly because of "[[golden handshake]]s" or the effort required, they will simply sell out their investment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Mechanisms and controls==
Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from [[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection]]. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt; Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a [[business group]]. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the [[external auditor]]) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing [[incentive alignment]] toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"/&gt;

===Internal corporate governance controls===
Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective actions to accomplish organisational goals. Examples include:
* '''Monitoring by the board of directors''': The board of directors, with its legal authority to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagat &amp; Black, "The Uncertain Relationship Between Board Composition and Firm Performance", 54 Business Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt; Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ''ex ante''. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Internal control procedures and internal auditors''': Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity's board of directors, audit committee, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting, operating efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity's internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Balance of power''': The simplest balance of power is very common; require that the President be a different person from the Treasurer.  This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other's actions.  One group may propose company-wide administrative changes, another group review and can veto the changes, and a third group check that the interests of people (customers, shareholders, employees) outside the three groups are being met.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Remuneration''': Performance-based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance. It may be in the form of cash or non-cash payments such as [[share (finance)|shares]] and [[share option]]s, [[superannuation]] or other benefits. Such incentive schemes, however, are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior, and can elicit myopic behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Monitoring by large shareholders''' and/or '''monitoring by banks and other large creditors''': Given their large investment in the firm, these stakeholders have the incentives, combined with the right degree of control and power, to monitor the management.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, pp. 104–105, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly traded U.S. corporations, boards of directors are largely ''chosen'' by the President/CEO and the President/CEO often takes the Chair of the Board position for him/herself (which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to "fire" him/her). The practice of the CEO also being the Chair of the Board is fairly common in large American corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Tom C. W., The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives (2011). 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt;

While this practice is common in the U.S., it is relatively rare elsewhere. In the U.K., successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===External corporate governance controls===
External corporate governance controls the external stakeholders' exercise over the organization. Examples include:
* competition
* debt covenants
* demand for and assessment of performance information (especially [[financial statements]])
* government regulations
* managerial labour market
* media pressure
* takeovers
* [[proxy firm]]s

===Financial reporting and the independent auditor===
The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation's internal and external [[financial report]]ing functions. The [[chief executive officer]] and [[chief financial officer]] are crucial participants, and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information. They oversee the internal accounting systems, and are dependent on the corporation's [[accountant]]s and [[internal auditor]]s.

Current accounting rules under [[International Accounting Standards]] and U.S. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements.  The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance increases the [[information risk]] for users. Financial reporting fraud, including non-disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users' information risk. To reduce this risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports, corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent [[external auditor]] who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements.

One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor.  Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the [[Enron scandal]]) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.

==Systemic problems==
* Demand for information: In order to influence the directors, the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting.&lt;ref name=6.9&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA9&amp;dq=%22A+barrier+to+shareholders+using+good+information+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E_vkT8HeH66I2gW44dTZCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20barrier%20to%20shareholders%20using%20good%20information%20%22&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management] 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring costs: A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it, especially to a small shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;
* Supply of accounting information: Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors. Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance. This should, ideally, be corrected by the working of the external auditing process.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;

==Issues==

===Executive pay===
{{main article|Say on pay}}
Increasing attention and regulation (as under the [[Swiss referendum "against corporate rip-offs" of 2013]]) has been brought to executive pay levels since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Research on the relationship between firm performance and [[executive compensation]] does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=current/&gt; Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share [[Option (finance)|option]] plans and that these plans direct managers' energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long-term, rather than the short-term, performance of the company.  However, that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and, in particular, the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X06001644 | doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2005.12.003 | volume=83 | issue=2 | title=Does backdating explain the stock price pattern around executive stock option grants? | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Financial Economics | pages=271–295 | last1 = Heron | first1 = Randall A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name=current&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA14&amp;lpg=SA6-PA14&amp;dq=Some+researchers+have+found+that+the+largest+CEO+performance+incentives+came+from+ownership+of+the+firm%27s+shares&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ihr3qx-hpF&amp;sig=P9L9MBVyoD8BsKIvr6nxOn8NPj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuDkT4fuHeW42wXIn5XaCQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20researchers%20have%20found%20that%20the%20largest%20CEO%20performance%20incentives%20came%20from%20ownership%20of%20the%20firm%27s%20shares&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/7193 As Companies Probe Backdating, More Top Officials Take a Fall] |Charles Forelle and James Bandler| October 12, 2006| wsj.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms.  A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs.  Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests.  These authors argued that, in part, corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options.  A compendium of academic works on the option/buyback issue is included in the study [http://ssrn.com/abstract=927111 ''Scandal''] by author [http://ssrn.com/author=665434 M. Gumport] issued in 2006.

A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed, and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of "open market" cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a [[share repurchase]] plan.

===Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles===
Shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) to lead management. The primary responsibility of the board relates to the selection and retention of the CEO.  However, in many U.S. corporations the CEO and Chairman of the Board roles are held by the same person. This creates an inherent conflict of interest between management and the board.

Critics of combined roles argue the two roles should be separated to avoid the conflict of interest and more easily enable a poorly performing CEO to be replaced. [[Warren Buffett]] wrote in 2014: "In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters-Warren Buffett-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that empirical studies do not indicate that separation of the roles improves stock market performance and that it should be up to shareholders to determine what corporate governance model is appropriate for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/opinion/the-jamie-dimon-witch-hunt.html?_r=0 NYT – Jeffrey Sonnenfeld – The Jamie Dimon Witch Hunt – May 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 73.4% of U.S. companies had combined roles; this fell to 57.2% by May 2012. Many U.S. companies with combined roles have appointed a "Lead Director" to improve independence of the board from management. German and UK companies have generally split the roles in nearly 100% of listed companies. Empirical evidence does not indicate one model is superior to the other in terms of performance. However, one study indicated that poorly performing firms tend to remove separate CEOs more frequently than when the CEO/Chair roles are combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3290632/SHOULD_THE_USA_FOLLOW_THE_UKS_LEAD_AND_SPLIT_THE_DUAL_CEO_CHAIRPERSONs_ROLE University of Cambridge-Magdalena Smith – Should the USA follow the UK's lead and split the dual CEO/Chairperson role?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal History ==

Dai Min is the granddaughter of General Dai Feng Xiang who supported [[Sun Yat-sen|Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]] in China’s [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1911. She grew up in China as a farm girl and “class enemy” during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

== Center for America China Partnership ==

[[John Milligan-Whyte]] and Dai Min  founded the Center for America China Partnership in 2005 and incorporated the America China Partnership Foundation in New York in 2007. They are the author and co-author of the America-China Partnership Book Series. In 2009 the official media of the Chinese government, [[China Daily]], named the Center “the first American think tank to combine and integrate American and Chinese perspectives providing a complete answer for America and China’s success in the 21st century.”{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Chinese government’s [[National Development and Reform Commission]] and the [[Beijing Foreign Studies University]], which has produced 90% of China’s diplomats, signed Memoranda of Cooperation with the Center and Foundation to implement the “New School of US-China Partnership” in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

At the request of the Director General of the Institute of American Studies at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] [[John Milligan-Whyte|Milligan-Whyte]] and Dai Min wrote and delivered ''A White Paper for the Presidents of America and China'' summarizing their America-China Partnership Book Series and the “New School of US-China Relations”, which their books created. The White Paper was used in [[Hu Jintao|President Hu’s]] preparations for negotiations with [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] in 2009.  The text of ''A White Paper for the Presidents of America and China'' is available at the Center for America China Partnership’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centeracp.com The Center ''for'' America China Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed US China Grand Strategy Agreement ==

In 2010 [[John Milligan-Whyte|Milligan-Whyte]], Dai Min, and [[Thomas P.M. Barnett|Dr. Thomas P.M. Barnett]], respectively the Chairman, President, and Executive Vice President of the Center for America China Partnership, drafted a Proposed China US Grand Strategy Agreement between [[Hu Jintao|President Hu]] and [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] with input and support from China’s: Former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Former UN Ambassador, Former U.S. Ambassador, Former Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]], Former Military Attaché to North Korea and Israel, Former Vice Minister of Commerce, China's [[Central Party School]] Institute of International Strategic Studies, Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, [[China Center for International Economic Exchanges]], China Institute For International Strategic Studies, China Foundation for International &amp; Strategic Studies, [[Boao Forum]], and State Council’s China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, which prepares classified briefing documents for China's President, Premier and State Councilors. Footage of the meetings is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://USChinaRelations.net USChinaRelations.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005160248/http://www.uschinarelations.net/ |date=2011-10-05 }} (Video of the meetings available for viewing)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New School of US China Relations ==

The first two books in the America China Partnership Series, China &amp; America’s Emerging Partnership: A New Realistic Perspective and New China Business Strategies: Chinese &amp; American Companies as Global Partners, were recognized by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], [[China Daily]] and [[People’s Daily]] as creating a “New School of US China Relations providing a complete answer for America and China's success in the 21st century”, which was announced at [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] and the first Global Think Tank Summit and in [[Foreign Affairs]] magazine in 2009.

China-US Relations in the Obama Administration: Facing Shared Challenges was translated into Mandarin and published in China by the [[Central Party School]].  The book's original English title, "China and America's Leadership in Peaceful Coexistence", was changed to match the Chinese title, 《致奥巴马总统和胡锦涛主席的外交关系白皮书》, given in Mandarin by the [[Central Party School]]. In this book, [[John Milligan-Whyte|Milligan-Whyte]] and Dai Min explain the convergence of US and China's security needs, the "New School of US-China Relations" perspectives and the advantages for both the US and China in aligning their national security if the US reciprocates China's peaceful coexistence policies.

== The New School of the Human Extinction Challenge ==

In the America-China Partnership Book Series[11], [[John Milligan-Whyte|Milligan-Whyte]] and Dai Min also present strategies for preventing human extinction. In China &amp; America’s Responsibilities in Mankind’s Future, published in English in 2010, which the [[Central Party School]] has also translated into Mandarin for publication in China, they pioneered two other new research areas which they term the “New School of the Human Extinction Challenge” and the “New School of the Philosophy, Genetics and Physics of Moral Authority.” They assert that mankind’s fundamental 21st century foreign policy, defense strategy and scientific research issue is discovering how to prevent human extinction in what they term "The Age of Species Lethal Weapons and Science". They reject [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington’s]] contention in [[The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order]] that the clash of civilizations is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.people.com.cn/GB/1032/10841175.html 美国人首获“中华杰出商业领袖社会责任奖]”。人民网。［2010－1－25］&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that mankind has no future in clash of civilization because of the power of 21st century weapons, technology and science and that collaboration of civilizations is essential if mankind is to prevent its extinction.

== The New School of the Philosophy, Genetics and Physics of Moral Authority ==

[[John Milligan-Whyte|Milligan-Whyte]] and Dai Min call for the study of human beings as phenomenon of physics because the laws of physics are the only laws that all human beings involuntarily obey. They assert that human conflict and collaboration can be better managed when understood as phenomena of physics. They assert that to discover defense systems able to prevent human extinction and solutions to the inconsistencies in what is currently believed about the laws of physics it is necessary to study both together as interrelated subjects and to understand persons exhibiting “moral authority” as phenomena of physics.

In China &amp; America's Responsibilities in Mankind's Future they assert that the thought and behavior processes of human beings which evolved over billions of years prior to the Age of Species Lethal Weapons and Science is in the process of leading to the human gene pool's extinction. They view genetic engineering of the human gene pool as urgent, essential and justified in order to prevent its extinction. They also assert that medicine is fundamentally a phenomenon of physics and that few medical doctors also have doctorates in physics. In a [[People's Daily Online]] article, "How to reduce America's budget by 45%",&lt;ref&gt;Milligan-Whyte, John and Dai Min.  "[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/98705/99725/7271933.html How to reduce 45 percent of US budget]".  ''People's Daily Online'.  January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; they called for the creation of research, teaching and treatment hospitals that combine expertise in genetic engineering, theoretic and experimental physics, American, Chinese and stem cell medicine and the comparative analysis of the cost, effectiveness and painfulness of each of those treatment modalities alone or in combination to make 21st century health care globally more effective and less costly and painful. They have proposed that the prototype of such research, educational and clinical hospitals be created in [[Jilin Province, China]].

== Human Extinction Challenge Solution Trust ==

Milligan-Whyte and Dai Min are respectively the chairman and president of the Human Extinction Challenge Trust called for in their books which focuses a global team of the species’ most able minds in the many areas of research needed to successfully understand human beings and "moral authority" as a phenomenon of physics and thus learn how to control human behavior so extinction can be prevented.

'''Elgar Fleisch''' (born January 22, 1968 in [[Bregenz]]) is an Austrian/Swiss academic, Professor of Technology Management at the [[University of St. Gallen]] and Professor of Information Management at the [[ETH Zurich]].

== Biography == 
Fleisch received his BA in mechanical engineering in 1987 at the [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt|HTL]] in [[Bregenz]], his Ma in business economics at the [[Vienna University of Technology]], and in 1993 his PhD in the area of [[Artificial Intelligence]]. In 1994 he completed his habilitation at the Institute of Computer Science at the [[University of St. Gallen]] (HSG) on corporate networks.

In 1996 Fleisch had interrupted his postdoctoral research for a year and founded the company IMG Americas in Philadelphia, USA. In 2000 he became assistant professor at the HSG. In 2002 he is appointed Professor at the Institute for Technology Management at the University of St. Gallen (ITEM-HSG). In 2004 he also became professor of Information Management at the [[ETH Zurich]] at the Department of Management, Technology and Economics (MTEC).

== Research == 
Ever since the emergence of the concept of [[Internet of Things]]  (IoT) in 1999, Fleisch's research interest focussed on the merger of the physical and digital worlds to an Internet of things. He aims to understand this merger in the dimensions of technology, applications and implications and, based on new technologies and applications for the benefit of the developing business and society.

Fleisch has organized his research into five research laboratories that span each over both universities, combine technology and economics and are theoretically grounded and anchored in practice. All projects take place in close cooperation with the industry, which resulted in numerous scientific papers and the introduction of nine startups.

In a statement released on 18 November 2006 the '''Energy and Minerals Business Council''' said: 
:"The aim for the natural resources industry is to provide sufficient resources at a reasonable price and in a sustainable way to ensure social and economic development."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmm.com/news/1467061118_StatementofEnergyandMineralsBusinessCouncil.pdf Statement of Energy and Minerals Business Council] International Council on Mining and Metals website 18 November 2006.

Resource industry leaders said there had been a lack of investment in capacity in the industry, with a decline in levels of both skills and research and development, and that growth in Asian demand had not been anticipated. "The industry has been responding to these changes and is making massive investments, but the lead times are typically up to 10 years," according to the statement reported in The Australian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20786046-643,00.html Mineral demand to prop up price] David Uren, The Australian, 20 November 2006.

The '''Galp''' Group is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[corporation]] which consists of more than 100 companies engaged in activities such as [[natural gas]] supply, regasification, transport, storage, and distribution; [[petroleum]] products exploration, production, refining, trading, logistics and retailing; co-generation and [[renewable energy]]. Its [[stock]] was partially listed on the [[Euronext Lisbon]] [[stock exchange]] in the second half of 2006.

==History==
SACOR, CIDLA, SONAP, PETROSUL, and PETROGAL were the main Portuguese companies from which current-day GALP was born.

SACOR was one of the first Portuguese oil companies.  In 1954, SACOR's activities extended to [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal's overseas territories]]; 80% of the [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and [[gasoil]] transported into the [[Portuguese overseas province of Angola]] had to be refined on [[continental Portugal]]'s territory.

The Portuguese discovered oil in their overseas province of Angola in the 1950s.  Portuguese-run Sociedade de Lubrificantes e Combustiveis ([[ANGOL]]) was set up in 1953 in Portuguese Angola. By the 1960s, it was also participating in the exploration for hydrocarbons.  In 1957, SACOR participated in the establishment of another oil company, MOÇACOR, in the [[Portuguese overseas province of Mozambique]].

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] military coup in 1974, Portugal handed over power to its overseas provinces.  In Portugal, PETROGAL was formed in April 1976 from four Portuguese companies —SACOR, CIDLA, SONAP, and PETROSUL — that were nationalized following the revolution of April 1974.  Galp Energia's [[initial public offering]] on the Lisbon Stock Exchange took place in 2006.

'''Gunnar Þór Gíslason''' is an [[Iceland]]ic businessman who was the [[chairman]] of [[Stoke City F.C.]] between November 1999 and May 2006. At the time he was the youngest chairman in [[the Football League]].

==Chairman of Stoke City==
In November 1999 Gunnar Þór Gíslason led an Icelandic consortium of businessman to take over English football club [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] from [[Peter Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gunnar Thor Gislason, Chairman|url=http://www.sagacapital.is/en/about-saga/shareholders-and-administration/board-of-directors|work=saga|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed his own choice of manager, [[Guðjón Þórðarson]] who led to club to the Division One in 2002. But he was sacked by Gíslason after a contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke sack Thordarson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/1987271.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Cotterill]] was appointed but quickly left and [[Tony Pulis]] was given the role to keep Stoke in the second tier. He succeeded but after a poor [[2004–05 Stoke City F.C. season|2004–05 season]] Pulis was sacked for "failing to exploit the foreign transfer market" and in his place came Dutch manager [[Johan Boskamp]]. He was in charge for just a season and in May 2006 Gíslason resigned as chairman of Stoke City, selling control of the club back to Peter Coates who re-appointed Tony Pulis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/5004658.stm 'Chairman Gislason departs Stoke', BBC Sport, 22 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''ISA 400 Risk Assessments and Internal Control''' is one of the [[International Standards on Auditing]]. It serves to require the [[auditor]] to understand the client's [[accounting system]] and [[internal control]] system and to assess [[control risk]] and [[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]. The objective is to determine the nature, timing and extent of [[substantive procedures]] in order to reduce [[audit risk]] to an acceptable low level.  

ISA 400 talks about the "walk through testing" or auditing in depth test.

This standard was withdrawn in 2004, and has been replaced with the ISA 315, “Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement” and the ISA 330, “The Auditor’s Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks”{{citation needed|date = December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3627">'''Invested capital''' represents the total cash investment that [[shareholders]] and [[debtholders]] have made in a company. There are two different but completely equivalent methods for calculating invested capital.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newconstructs.com/education-invested-capital/&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''operating approach'' is calculated as:

Invested capital = operating net working capital + net property, plant &amp; equipment + capitalized operating leases + other operating assets + operating intangibles &amp;minus; other operating liabilities &amp;minus; cumulative adjustment for amortization of R&amp;D

Equivalently, the ''financing approach'' is calculated as
{|
|-
| Invested capital = || total debt and leases
|-
| align="right" | + ||  total equity and equity equivalents
|-
| align="right" | &amp;minus;  || non-operating cash and investments
|}

In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;K = D + E - M \, &lt;/math&gt;

Invested capital is used in several important measurements of financial performance, including [[return on invested capital]], [[economic value added]], and [[free cash flow]].

'''John Andrew Boehner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|n|ər}} {{respell|BAY|nər}};&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; born {{nowrap|November 17}}, 1949) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|53rd]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/05/pelosi.boehner/index.html | work=CNN | title=Boehner takes charge as new Congress convenes | date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he was the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OH|8}} from 1991 to 2015. The district included several rural and suburban areas near [[Cincinnati]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].

Boehner previously served as the [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] from 2007 until 2011, and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 2006 until 2007. Boehner's almost nine years as the Republican Leader in the House (four years as Minority Leader and nearly five years as Speaker) was the longest consecutive tenure for a Republican Leader in the House since [[Robert H. Michel|Bob Michel]] of Illinois served 14 years as House Minority Leader between 1981 and 1995. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican caucus.

In September 2016, [[Squire Patton Boggs]], the third largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. It was also announced that Boehner would become a board member of [[Reynolds American]], the second biggest tobacco firm in the U.S., for an estimated annual salary of $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/john-boehner-squire-patton-boggs/ |title=John Boehner Joins Squire Patton Boggs, Law Firm Known for Lobbying |publisher=Fortune.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and [[plastics industry]]. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Early political career ==
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. He then served as an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state representative]] from 1985 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9538 Boehner, John Andrew].

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
[[File:Representative John Boehner in 1993 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Boehner in 1993]]
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. In a three-way Republican primary that included Boehner, Lukens, and former Congressman [[Tom Kindness]], Boehner won with 49 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="talberta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberta|first1=Tim|title=John Boehner Unchained|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/29/john-boehner-trump-house-republican-party-retirement-profile-feature-215741|accessdate=30 October 2017|publisher=Politio|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, [[Greg Jolivette]], in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|November election]].  He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.

=== Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America'' ===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The group also [[Congressional Post Office scandal|investigated]] the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; Later, he, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 congressional elections]] during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

=== Republican leadership ===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]], making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Republicans lost seats in the [[United States elections, 1998|1998 elections]], the House Republican leadership underwent a reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced by [[Dennis Hastert]], and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to [[J.C. Watts]].&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt;

=== Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor ===

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]], serving from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George F.

=== House Republican Leader ===
[[File:John Boehner portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|2006 portrait of Boehner]]

Delay resigned as Majority Leader in 2005 after being indicted, and Boehner, House Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]], and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], all sought to succeed Delay.&lt;ref name="talberta"/&gt; Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as Majority Whip, the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call |accessdate=2006-02-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204102043/http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918155340/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats.

Boehner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 23, 2014. When asked by [[Jay Leno|Leno]] if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf.

On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after [[Pope Francis]]' [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|address to Congress the day before]], an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.  Conservative opposition to funding [[Planned Parenthood]] as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement.&lt;ref name="resign1"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Boehner Will Resign From Congress|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/boehner-will-resign-from-congress.html|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California had announced he would run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly announced he would not run for Speaker, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Caucus.

== Controversies ==
{{criticism section|date=June 2015}}

=== Connections to lobbyists ===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that's gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/109th.pdf House Rule IV 7] at rules.house.gov. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829022048/http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/109th.pdf |date=August 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/politics/12boehner.html |title=A G.O.P.

=== Smithsonian ===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, "Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113006801.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | title=Portrait Gallery removes crucifix video from exhibit after complaints | date=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hurricane Sandy relief bill ===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the House without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]]. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] harshly criticized Boehner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chris-christie-slams-john-boehner-hurricane-sandy-presser-18120271|title=Gov.

|publisher=The Hill|date= January 2013|accessdate =June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some commentators praised Boehner for not passing a bill they saw as full of [[pork barrel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redstate.com/2013/01/07/what-did-congress-do-about-hurricane-sandy-rape-it-for-what-its-worth/|title=What Did Congress Do About Hurricane Sandy?

=== Cromnibus and 2015 House Chair election ===
Many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were ready for a new [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections. ''EMC Research'' reported 60% of participants in their telephone survey wanted a new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/251502982/National-Telephone-Survey-of-Republican-Voters|title=National Telephone Survey of Republican Voters|publisher=EMC Research|date= January 2014|accessdate =January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end there were a total of 25 votes against Boehner, 29 were needed in order to choose a new speaker. Boehner responded by removing those who opposed him from influential committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html|title=Boehner takes revenge|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A profile in the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' said, "On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_624471.html|title=Boehner's job: Recapture 'squandered' GOP brand|author=Salena Zito|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=May 10, 2009|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' says Boehner "has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/waiting_for_the_banana_peel_ho.html|title=House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio helps unite GOP|work=The Plain Dealer|author=Sabrina Eaton|date=March 8, 2009|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boehner has been classified as a "hard-core conservative" by [[OnTheIssues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issues2000.org/OH/John_Boehner.htm |title=John Boehner on the Issues |publisher=Issues2000.org |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Boehner has a conservative voting record, when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021100842.html |title=Washington Post |work=Washington Post |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boehner opposes [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], as evidenced by his vote for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in both 2004 and 2006.  In a letter to the [[Human Rights Campaign]], Boehner stated, "I oppose any legislation that would provide special [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights for homosexuals]]...  Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of [[Traditional family|the traditional family]] as one of the fundamental tenets of [[Western culture|western civilization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Equality magazine.

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

Boehner is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]'s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].&lt;ref name="ATR"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Boehner labeled former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] a traitor after his [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaks]] went public.&lt;ref name=20130611sfchron&gt;{{cite news |title=John Boehner: Edward Snowden Is A 'Traitor' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 11, 2013 |last= LoGiurato |first= Brett |url= http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/JOHN-BOEHNER-Edward-Snowden-Is-A-Traitor-4593261.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I'm not qualified to debate the science over [[climate change]]," Boehner said at a press conference on May 29, 2014 at which he criticized proposed federal regulations on [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal-fired power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boehner 'not qualified' to debate climate change |first=Russell |last=Berman |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/207580-boehner-not-qualified-to-debate-climate-change |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Boehner: I'm 'not qualified' to debate climate change |date=May 29, 2014 |first=Aliyah |last=Frumin |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/boehner-not-qualified-debate-climate-change |accessdate=March 20, 2015 |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Republicans Keep Telling Everyone They're Not Scientists|first=Coral|last=Davenport|date=October 30, 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=March 20, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/why-republicans-keep-telling-everyone-theyre-not-scientists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial crisis ===
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Ben Bernanke]], and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/lawmakers-inside-advantage-trading "Lawmakers' inside advantage to trading"] ''Marketplace.''

[[File:President Obama &amp; John Boehner debt ceiling negotions. JPG.JPG|thumb|left|Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations]]
On October 3, 2008 Boehner voted in favor of the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll681.xml Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008] Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. October 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; believing that [[Article One of the United States Constitution|the enumerated powers]] grant Congress the authority to "purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector."

Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.&lt;ref name="Wereschagin" /&gt; He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |title=House GOP Economic Recovery Alternative Will Create 6.2 Million New American Jobs &amp;#124; Republican Leader John Boehner |publisher=Republicanleader.house.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608232152/http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep.

As Republican House Leader, Boehner was a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions.

== Post-speakership ==

=== Politics ===
Boehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Ted Cruz]] as "[[Lucifer]] in the flesh" in an interview at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Kristina|title=John Boehner Calls Ted Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/28/john-boehner-calls-ted-cruz-lucifer-in-the-flesh/|accessdate=28 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, after [[Donald Trump]] became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's support for him became public, though he distanced himself on several policies and expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: "Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/john-boehner-backs-donald-trump/|date=May 12, 2016|publisher=CNN|title=John Boehner backs Donald Trump, thanks God Cruz didn't win|first=Phil|last=Mattingly}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2017, Boehner predicted Republicans would "fix" the Affordable Care Act and give it a different name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/john-boehner-obamacare/|title=Boehner: Obamacare repeal and replace 'not what's going to happen'|date=February 24, 2017|publisher=CNN|first=Terence|last=Burlij}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===

Boehner joined the board of tobacco company [[Reynolds American]] on September 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan |first=Matt |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/investing/john-boehner-smoking-joins-tobacco-company/ |title=Heavy smoker John Boehner joins tobacco company's board - Sep. 15, 2016 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, John Boehner announced his joining the board of Acreage Holdings, a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] corporation, to "promote the use of [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical marijuana]]" and to advocate for federal [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization]] of it, a shift in his previously adamant opposition to [[cannabis in the United States|cannabis]] legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gstalter|first1=Morgan|title=Boehner joins cannabis company board to push for medical use|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/382614-boehner-joins-board-of-cannabis-company-for-push-for-medical|website=The Hill|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In reporting his pending retirement, [[Politico]] summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, "Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''POLITICO'' Sept. 25, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Kane in the ''Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the "big deals" he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted" [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Kane argues,  Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, "a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner's easygoing style did not fit."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]]. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James Rowley |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Boehner's Blue-Collar Roots Frame Possible Next Speaker's Views |journal=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225642/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Boehner and his wife bought a $835,000 condo in [[Marco Island, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/news/house-speaker-john-boehner-bringing-tan-tears-to-marco-island-after-buying-luxury-condo-ep-477587229-331048911.html |title=House Speaker John Boehner bringing tan, tears to Marco Island after buying luxury condo |date=February 20, 2014 |newspaper=[[Naples Daily News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letters of assist''' refers to a [[contract]]ual document issued by the [[United Nations]] (UN) to a government authorizing it to provide goods or services to a [[peacekeeping]] or other UN operation.

==Formal definition and usage==
A contractual document issued by the United Nations (UN) to a government authorizing it to provide goods or services to a peacekeeping operation; the UN agrees either to purchase the goods or services or authorizes the government to supply them subject to reimbursement by the UN. A letter of assist typically details specifically what is to be provided by the contributing government and establishes a funding limit that cannot be exceeded. Also called LOA. See also peacekeeping.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/letter+of+assist Letters of Assist] (''The Free Dictionary'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingent Owned Equipment===
LOAs are often used in conjunction with [[Contingent owned equipment|Contingent Owned Equipment]], an important aspect of many UN operations, peacekeeping or [[UN Police|police]]. As the official UN website puts it:

:''The United Nations is financially responsible for the costs of contingent deployment to the mission and arranges a commercial contract or Letter of Assist (LOA) with the contributing country to transport the equipment, either by Sea, Rail, Road, or in special circumstances by Air. LOA are like commercial contracts but are only arranged between the UN and contributing countries Governments. Troops are normally transported by air to the peacekeeping mission area, with a cargo limit of 45kg per person. Equipment is deployed for the duration of the service in the mission area by the contingent. Personnel rotations, whereby contingent members are replaced with new personnel occur on a periodic basis, usually every 6/12 months.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/sites/coe/staff.shtml Contingent Owned Equipment; Deployment in the Field] (''United Nations Peacekeeping COE subsite, Accessed July 6th 2013'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of LOAs to the UN Budget===
As of 30 April 2013, the UN was liable for $64 million in relation to Letters of Assist, out of a total of $810 million then owed to Member States with regards as to outstanding payments for Peacekeeping and/or Policing operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N13/333/97/pdf/N1333397.pdf Review of the financial situation, section B. Peacekeeping Operations, paragraph 18] (''Improving the financial situation of the United Nations; Report of the Secretary-General - Addendum [14th May 2013]'' Accessed 6 July 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Masaru Hayami'''|速水 優|Hayami Masaru|24 March 1925 – 17 May 2009}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] businessman, central banker, the 28th Governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] (BOJ) and a Director of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bilderberg Group]], [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:B6SKChjKuz0J:www.bilderberg.org/bankers.doc+masaru+hayami+bank+of+international+settlements&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjVR14wviPh9d26ycBntH57T4HTQENvXSO08-8eJw35y5ox2wT6WcjrBTJPOtIDxrN8S-45ogO2mGSxFPH2zELBQFXkZUvnUTedUHkbjWAhHtG_gULxjumQae91a3UO-eDRZ1iQ&amp;sig=AHIEtbSLMny6eK-Z_D8Ufy617y7naGq52g  Money-Traders Global Network]; retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hayami was born in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bank of Japan (BOJ), [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/pre_gov/sousai28.htm/  28th Governor]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[The Tokyo College of Commerce]] (now [[Hitotsubashi University]]) in 1947.
 
==Career==
Hayami was Chief Executive Officer of the [[Nissho Iwai]] Corporation,

He served as Governor of the Bank of Japan from March 20, 1998 to March 19, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;BOJ, [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/pre_gov/index.htm/ List of Governors]&lt;/ref&gt;  He took over the top BOJ role in 1998, after Governor [[Yasuo Matsushita]] and Deputy Governor [[Toshihiko Fukui]] resigned in connection with a scandal involving leaks of financially sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Richard A. (2003). {{Google books|bHLC7VOc9JoC|''Princes of the Yen: Japan's Central Bankers and the Transformation of the Economy,'' p. 309 n.27|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Hayami was a controversial BOJ governor because he insisted Japanese politicians must change the structure of the economy before the BOJ could take further measures to end [[deflation]].

He fiercely resisted politicians' demand to loosen monetary policy, thereby increasing the pressure on politicians to reduce stifling regulation, monopolies, and oligopolies in various economic sectors. This strategy stressed Japan's long-term economic health over the short term problems of deflation and recession.

Any member of the public is able to use the system by either becoming a subscribing member or paying a one-off fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bikeseoul.com/app/use/moveUseMenuClauseInfo.do|title=서울자전거 이용약관|website=서울자전거 이용약관|publisher=서울자전거(따릉이)|trans-title=Terms &amp; Conditions about seoul bike rental system|publication-date=2015-12-16|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

System setups differ between cities. In some areas, users must purchase a special card in order to hire a bicycle. Once registered for membership, users are able to use the system for free. There are various types of membership, which are defined by length of time and location. However, bicycles are not required to be returned to the same hire stand from which they were removed. Rental facilities are located at many sites around South Korea where users can rent and return bikes. Members are also able to view their ride details on the system's website.

== Typical features ==
Many South Korean localities manage their own public bicycle rental system. Each city's local government administers the program, resulting in some differences between jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=온라인뉴스팀|title=서울 공공자전거 '따릉이'15일부터 운영…이용방법‘스마트폰 앱 대여’|url=http://www.sportsworldi.com/content/html/2015/10/15/20151015000765.html?OutUrl=naver|accessdate=2015-10-15|work=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goyang ===

=== Ulsan ===
The Ulsan city bicycle system has become very popular. Shortly after its launch, over five hundred residents and three hundred tourists used the system on a single day. As a result, the city's government has announced that the scheme will be expanded to accommodate the extra demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iusm.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=665215|title=중구 자전거대여소 인기…하루평균 500여명 이용|work=2016-06-20|publisher=울산매일 iusm.co.kr|publication-date=2016-06-02|trans-title=Bike rental system in Ul-san shows tremendous popularity|last1=조|first1=혜정|accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public reception ==
The success of bicycle share systems in existing cities has prompted other governments, such as [[Sejong City|Sejong]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kwan, Sunjae|title=세종시, 공공자전거 '어울링' 확대 운영...대중교통 연계도 강화|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201603281327051&amp;code=620108|publisher=Kyunghyang News|trans-title=Sejong government expands public bike rental system|accessdate=2016-07-24|work=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consider introducing their own programs. Authorities in cities with existing systems have also announced expansion plans to cater for growing demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ok, Yujung|title=서울시, 공공자전거 '따릉이' 확대 설치|url=http://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=3251239&amp;ref=A|publisher=KBS|trans-title=Seoul government expands public bike rental system|accessdate=2016-07-24|work=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee, Jonghoon|title=고양 공공임대자전거 서비스 확대|url=http://www.incheonilbo.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=700328|publisher=Incheonilbo|trans-title=Goyang government expands public bike rental service|accessdate=2016-07-24|work=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other businesses have been established to cater for the surge in popularity of bicycles, boosting local economies. These include companies supplying protective gear and custom-designed bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=SBSCNBC|title=[터치&amp;이슈] 대한민국 휩쓴 자전거 열풍…관련 산업도 '쑥쑥'|url=http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000768128|accessdate=2015-11-13|work=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=523750|title=씽씽 달리는 자전거주…공공자전거 확대로 수요 급증|work=2016-06-20|publisher=매일경제 MBN|publication-date=2013-07-01|trans-title=Stock prices of bicycle industry are increasing with public bike system|last1=Kim|first1=Kab Ho|accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental benefits of the system have been estimated at 25 trillion won, primarily from carbon emissions savings as a result of bicycle usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=이|first1=슬기|title=University: "25 million won saved by cycling"|url=http://www.outdoornews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=20132|accessdate=2015-11-13|work=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future development ==
A number of upgrades to the system have been announced, including the launch of a [[mobile app]] allowing users to rent &amp; return system using [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=온라인뉴스팀|title=서울 공공자전거 '따릉이'15일부터 운영…이용방법‘스마트폰 앱 대여’|url=http://www.sportsworldi.com/content/html/2015/10/15/20151015000765.html?OutUrl=naver|accessdate=2015-10-15|work=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse innovation is the process whereby goods developed as inexpensive models to meet the needs of developing nations, such as battery-operated medical instruments in countries with limited [[infrastructure]], are then repackaged as low-cost innovative goods for Western buyers.

== Definition ==
The process of reverse innovation begins by focusing on needs and requirements for low-cost products in countries like India. Once products are developed for these markets, they are then sold elsewhere - even in the West - at low prices which creates new markets and uses for these innovations.

Typically, companies start their globalization efforts by removing expensive features from their established product, and attempt to sell these de-featured products in the developing world.  This approach, unfortunately, is not very competitive, and targets only the most affluent segments of society in these developing countries. Reverse innovation, on the other hand, leads to products which are created locally in developing countries, tested in local markets, and, if successful, then upgraded for sale and delivery in the developed world.

The term 'reverse innovation' was originally defined differently as - '''innovation blowback''' - by [[John Hagel III]] and [[John Seely Brown]] in their 2005 ''McKinsey Quarterly'' article titled ''Innovation blowback: Disruptive management practices from Asia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Innovation blowback: Disruptive management practices from Asia ''(McKinsey Quarterly)''  |url=http://www.johnseelybrown.com/innovationblowback.pdf |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, their message warns that "the periphery of today's global business environment is where innovation potential is the highest... Edges define and describe the borders of companies, markets, industries, geographies, intellectual disciplines, and generations. They are the places where unmet customer needs find unexpected solutions, where [[disruptive innovation]]s and blue oceans get birthed, and where edge capabilities transform the core competencies of the corporation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Embrace the Edge -- or Perish ''(BusinessWeek)''  |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/nov2007/id20071128_162890.htm |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.K. Prahalad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=5 Tips for Trickle-Up Innovation from C.K. Prahalad ''(BusinessWeek)'' |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2009/04/5_tips_for_tric.html |accessdate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that there are five ways in which resource-starved developing countries lead rich nations: 1) affordability, 2) leapfrog technologies, 3) service ecosystems, 4) robust systems, and 5) add-on applications.  These very deprivations are catalysts for reverse innovation.

== Reverse innovation in global health systems ==

Reverse innovation has been identified as a key emerging trend in global health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carus|first=Felicity|title=Reverse innovation brings social solutions to developed countries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/reverse-innovation-social-solutions-home|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belluz|first=Julia|title=7 key health trends for 2013|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/12/27/seven-key-health-trends-for-2013/|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=Maclean's|date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key health areas where low-income countries can offer solutions to medium and high-income country settings include, rural health service delivery; skills substitution; decentralisation of management; creative problem-solving; education in communicable disease control; innovation in mobile phone use; low technology simulation training; local product manufacture; health financing; and social entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Developed-developing country partnerships: Benefits to developed countries?|journal=Globalization and Health|volume=8|pages=17|url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/8/1/17|accessdate=30 January 2013|doi=10.1186/1744-8603-8-17|pmid=22709651|pmc=3459713|year=2012|last1=Syed|first1=Shamsuzzoha B.|last2=Dadwal|first2=Viva|last3=Rutter|first3=Paul|last4=Storr|first4=Julie|last5=Hightower|first5=Joyce D.|last6=Gooden|first6=Rachel|last7=Carlet|first7=Jean|last8=Nejad|first8=Sepideh|last9=Kelley|first9=Edward T.|last10=Donaldson|first10=Liam|last11=Pittet|first11=Didier}}&lt;/ref&gt; System-wide benefits may also be seen as accruing across every part of the World Health Organization Health Systems Framework, specifically the six building blocks of health systems: (1) service delivery; (2) health workforce; (3) health information; (4) medical products, vaccines, and technologies; (5) health financing; and (6) health leadership and governance. However, the applicability of developing country innovations in developed country settings remains relatively undocumented and further work needs to be undertaken to advance understanding of health innovation diffusion between countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/10/09/reverse-innovation-in-global-health-systems-call-for-papers/|url=http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/10/09/reverse-innovation-in-global-health-systems-call-for-papers/|publisher=BioMed Central Blog|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208022235/http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/10/09/reverse-innovation-in-global-health-systems-call-for-papers/|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricardo Belmont 3.jpg|thumb|Ricardo Belmont Cassinelli]]
'''Ricardo Belmont Cassinelli''' is a [[Peru]]vian [[TV network]] owner and politician. He was the mayor of [[Lima]]&lt;ref name="FoxFox1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Fox|first2=Fox de Cardona|title=Latin American broadcasting: from tango to telenovela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9g63lxssFP8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=7 April 2011|year=1997|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-1-86020-515-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1990 to 1995. He was popularly known as "El Hermanón" (Big Brother) for his friendliness and also as "El Colora'o" (Ginger) because of his reddish hair.

==Career==
Ricardo Belmont is the son of Augusto Belmont Bar, who founded TV Bego Excelsior (Channel 11 in Peru) in 1967. TV Bego Excelsior also owned Excelsior FM radio (104.7 FM in Peru). The younger Belmont was an avid sportsman who enjoyed [[soccer]] and [[boxing]], and was a patron of players in both sports. His sports passion would later influence him in his political speeches, using sporting terms such as "let's all kick into the same goal post", and, during his reelection bid, "Second half time is about to start, and it's works vs. words. Choose the tree [his electoral [[symbol]]] and we'll win the game." In his "serious" life, he dedicated himself to [[journalism]], befriending several local and national politicians all the while aspiring to be his own man in the media business. In his spare time he also dedicated his life to worthy causes, the most prominent being the local '''Telethon''' (based on the American version by [[Jerry Lewis]]), dedicated to helping the disabled kids at the San Juan de Dios Clinic in Lima.

In 1986 he took over Channel 11 and renamed it Red Bicolor de Comunicaciones (''Bicolor Communications Network''; the initials RBC allude to his personal name). Initially airing only from noon to midnight, Belmont mostly purchased American programming such as [[Bonanza]], [[Get Smart]], [[Bravestarr]], and [[The Twilight Zone]] (the 1985 version). The few RBC-produced shows included "Desafio Familiar", which was a Peruvian version of [[Family Feud]], "Habla el Pueblo", a [[Larry King]]-inspired talk show with Belmont himself as host, and "Mirando la Música", a [[music video]] program. In the late 1980s RBC started diversifying to break out of the niche market to compete with the Peruvian Big Two, America Television and Panamericana Television. RBC Radio 980 AM was mostly sports talk, while 91.9 FM was adult contemporary, in addition to Excelsior, which was mostly tropical and salsa.

In 1990 he announced his candidacy for the Lima provincial mayoralty as an independent. His political party, OBRAS (Works) alluded to the need for public works in Lima and the overall lack of progress as mayor by [[Jorge del Castillo Gálvez]], who was seen more as a lackey of Peruvian President [[Alan García]] than as an effective mayor. Although he supported [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s Presidential candidacy, he chose to oppose Vargas Llosa's party's chosen mayoral candidate, [[Juan Inchaustegui]]. Belmont's charisma developed as a TV host and his lack of political affiliation helped him earn the people's vote, and he began to start his public-works program, which included several road and community improvement projects detailed below.

Initially Belmont and the new Peruvian president, [[Alberto Fujimori]], were seen as comrades in arms because of their common political backgrounds as independents. The fiercely independent Belmont, however, drawing on his business skills, was able to get funds from several private enterprises to fund his programs.

Among the many public works projects he completed include:
*Intercambio Vial Norte (Northern Interchange): was a paving of Avenida Universitaria linking Carabayllo and San Miguel districts, with an interchange with Panamericana Norte along the way.
*Intercambio Vial Este (Eastern Interchange): was a combination of two new bridges spanning the Rimac River linking El Agustino directly with San Juan de Lurigancho
*Intercambio Vial Sur (Southern Interchange): was an actual [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] between Panamericana Sur, Av. Circunvalacion and Av. Javier Prado that eliminated traffic light crossings.
*Several ''losa deportiva''s (sports grounds) for poor communities, mostly [[concrete]] fields for mini-soccer, basketball, and squash.

Elected to a second term in 1994, Belmont and Fujimori had a falling out, due to resentment from Fujimori at Belmont's former support of Vargas Llosa. Fujimori, through his party-controlled Congress, issued Legislative Decree No. 776, by which provincial mayors were forced to distribute their government income down to the distrital halls under them (particularly from rich to poor distrital municipalities in the interior of the country). This stopped Belmont from pursuing further public works and improvements, and the municipal employees (most of whom were APRA party members left over from the Castillo administration) began turning against him through demonstrations, increasing his unpopularity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22701">[[File:Schneider Trophy Science Museum London.jpg|thumb|The Schneider Trophy, on display at the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
The '''Coupe d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Aviation Maritime Jacques Schneider''', commonly called the '''Schneider Trophy''' or '''Schneider Prize''' (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the ''Schneider Cup'', a different prize), was a trophy awarded annually (and later, biennially) to the winner of a race for [[seaplane]]s and flying boats. The Schneider Trophy is now held at the Science Museum, South Kensington, London.

Announced in 1912 by [[Jacques Schneider]], a French financier, balloonist and aircraft enthusiast, the competition offered a prize of approximately £1,000. The race was held twelve times between 1913 and 1931. It was intended to encourage technical advances in civil aviation but became a contest for pure speed with laps over a (usually) triangular course (initially 280&amp;nbsp;km, later 350&amp;nbsp;km). The contests were staged as time trials, with aircraft setting off individually at pre-agreed times, usually 15 minutes apart. The contests were very popular and some attracted crowds of over 200,000 spectators. An earlier trophy, also presented by Jacques Schneider in 1910, in France, was the Schneider Cup, which is now in the possession of the [[RAF College Cranwell]].

If an aero club won three races in five years, they would retain the trophy and the winning pilot would receive 75,000 [[franc]]s for each of the first three wins. Each race was hosted by the previous winning country. The races were supervised by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] and the aero club in the hosting country. Each club could enter up to three competitors with an equal number of alternatives.

The race was significant in advancing aeroplane design, particularly in the fields of [[aerodynamics]] and engine design, and would show its results in the best fighters of World War II. The streamlined shape and the low drag, liquid-cooled engine pioneered by Schneider Trophy designs are obvious in the British [[Supermarine Spitfire]], the American [[North American P-51 Mustang]], and the Italian [[Macchi C.202|Macchi C.202 ''Folgore'']].

The Schneider Trophy is a sculpture of silver &amp; bronze set on a marble base. It depicts a zephyr skimming the waves, and a nude winged figure is seen kissing a zephyr recumbent on a breaking wave. The heads of two other zephyrs and of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], the god of the Sea, can be seen surrounded by octopus and crabs. The symbolism represents speed conquering the elements of sea and air.

==History==
The first competition was held on 16 April 1913, at [[Monaco]]. It was won by a French [[Société pour les Appareils Deperdussin|Deperdussin]] at an average speed of {{convert|73.56|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Eves240"&gt;Eves 2001, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The British won in 1914 with a [[Sopwith Tabloid]] at {{convert|139.74|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Eves240"/&gt; 

After [[World War I]], the competition resumed in 1919 at [[Bournemouth]] where in [[fog]]gy conditions the Italian team won. They were later disqualified and the race was voided.&lt;ref name="Eves241"&gt;Eves 2001, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 and 1921 at [[Venice]] the Italians won — in 1920 no other nation entered and in 1921 the French entry did not start.&lt;ref name="Eves241"/&gt; 
After 1921, an additional requirement was added: the winning seaplane had to remain moored to a buoy for six hours without human intervention.

In 1922 in [[Naples]] the British and French competed with the Italians. The British private entry, a [[Supermarine Sea Lion II]], was the victor.&lt;ref name="Eves242"&gt;Eves 2001, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The French aircraft did not start the race, which became a competition between the Sea Lion and three Italian aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200495.html Schneider Victor's Welcome Home]&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[Macchi M.7]] and a Savoia.

The 1923 trophy, contested at [[Cowes]], went to the Americans with a sleek, liquid-cooled engined craft designed by [[Glenn Curtiss]]. It used the [[Curtiss D-12]] engine. US Navy Lieutenant David Rittenhouse won the cup.&lt;ref name="Eves242"/&gt;

In 1924 there was no competition as no other nation turned out to face the Americans — the Italians and the French withdrew and both British craft crashed in pre-race trials.

In 1925 at [[Chesapeake Bay]] the Americans won again, the US pilot [[Jimmy Doolittle]] winning in a [[Curtiss R3C]] ahead of the British [[Gloster III]] and the Italian entry. Two British planes did not compete ([[R. J. Mitchell]]'s [[Supermarine S.4]] and the other Gloster III were damaged before the race). Two of the American planes did not finish.&lt;ref name="Eves242"/&gt;

In 1926, the Italians returned with a [[Macchi M.39]] and won against the Americans with a {{convert|396.69|km/h|abbr=on}} run at [[Hampton Roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Eves 2001, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 at Venice there was a strong British entry with government backing and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilots (the [[High Speed Flight RAF|High Speed Flight]]) for [[Supermarine]], [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]], and [[Short Brothers|Shorts]]. Supermarine's Mitchell-designed S.5s took first and second places. 1927 was the last annual competition, the event then moving to a biennial schedule to allow for more development time.&lt;ref name="Eves244"&gt;Eves 2001, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, at [[Calshot]], [[Supermarine]] won again in the [[Supermarine S.6]] with the new [[Rolls-Royce R]] engine with an average speed of {{convert|528.89|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Eves244"/&gt; Both Britain and Italy entered two new aircraft and a backup plane from the previous race.

In 1931 the British government withdrew support, but a private donation of £100,000 from [[Lucy, Lady Houston]], allowed Supermarine to compete and win on 13 September against only British opposition, with reportedly half a million spectators lining the beachfronts. The Italian, French, and German entrants failed to ready their aircraft in time for the competition. The remaining British team set both a new world speed record ({{convert|610|km/h|abbr=on}}) and won the trophy outright with a third straight win.&lt;ref&gt;Eves 2001, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The following days saw the winning [[Supermarine S.6B]] further break the world speed record twice, making it the first craft to break the 400&amp;nbsp;mph barrier on 29 September at an average speed of {{convert|655.8|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Development of the other entrants did not cease there. The proposed Italian entrant (the [[Macchi M.C.72]]) which pulled out of the contest due to engine problems later went on to set two new world speed records. In April 1933 (over [[Lake Garda]], in northern Italy) it set a record with a speed of {{convert|682.36|km/h|abbr=on}}. Eighteen months later in the same venue, it broke the 700&amp;nbsp;km/h barrier with an average speed of {{convert|709.202|km/h|abbr=on}}. Both times the plane was piloted by [[Francesco Agello]]. This speed remains the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engined seaplane.&lt;ref name="Gunston58"&gt;Gunston 1989, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Alumni==
*[[R. J. Mitchell|Reginald J. Mitchell]], designer of the winning Supermarine Schneider Trophy entrants, also designed the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].
*[[Mario Castoldi]], designer of the 1926 winner, the [[Macchi M.39]], also designed other contestants such as the M.52, the M.52R, the M.67, and the [[Macchi M.C.72|M.C.72]]. After the M.C.72 Castoldi designed some of the Italian fighters which flew during [[World War II]], such as the [[MC.202]].
*[[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], winning pilot of the 1925 race, was accomplished in many other areas. He led the famous "[[Doolittle Raid]]", an American bombing attack on several Japanese homeland targets in April 1942.

The trophy itself has been entrusted to the [[Royal Aero Club]] and can be viewed along with the winning [[Supermarine S.6B]] floatplane at the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] Flight exhibition hall. Supermarine S.6, ''N248'', which competed in the 1929 contest but was disqualified, is preserved at [[Solent Sky]] maritime museum in [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitfireonline.co.uk/ Solent Sky aviation museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in name==
In 1981 the race was revived, in name if not in concept, by the [[Royal Aero Club]] of Great Britain to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Britain's ultimate retention of the Trophy. The original Trophy remained in the Science Museum, and a full-size replica was cast and the race opened on a handicapped basis to any propeller–driven landplane capable of maintaining 100 miles per hour in straight and level flight, and weighing up to 12,500&amp;nbsp;lb. Pilots also had to have a minimum of 100 hours as pilot-in-command, and a valid air racing licence.

Following that event, the UK subsidiary of US computer company [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) independently decided to sponsor a long-term revival of the Schneider Trophy, with the first race held in 1984. The idea was submitted by DEC's then UK PR consultancy Infopress as part of a broader commercial sponsorship programme designed to increase DEC's presence in the UK market at that time. DEC sponsored this revived race series from 1984 until 1991, which also marked the diamond jubilee of the final race in the original series. DEC and Infopress turned to the expertise of the Royal Aero Club's Records, Racing &amp; Rally Association which again administered and ran the actual races. The 1981 Solent course, itself a close approximation of the original 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy courses over the Solent, was also used and adapted from year to year.

This sponsorship had a profound effect on the awareness and popularity of handicapped air racing in the UK and further afield, as well as markedly increasing DEC's commercial profile in the UK. The appeal of the race, its historic connections, and the fact that prize money was now on offer, meant that the entry list for the race was large enough to warrant the introduction of heats from 1985 onwards. (The 1984 race field was 62 entrants, believed at the time to be the largest-ever in all forms of air racing.)

The event received further boosts in 1986, when it was started by HRH Prince Andrew and his then fiancée Sarah Ferguson; in 1987, when the event was featured as one episode in a BBC television documentary series; and in 1988, when it was a central part of that year's ITV Telethon Appeal.

DEC invited customers and partners to each year's event as guests, and the general public watched in increasing numbers as the series grew in size and popularity.

For the pilots taking part, the event became, along with the [[King's Cup Race]], the highlight of the UK's air racing season, and regularly attracted entrants from continental Europe.

DEC continued to sponsor the races through 1991. Since that time, the race has been run by the [http://www.britishairracing.com Royal Aero Club Records Racing and Rally Association] along with the King's Cup and the [[British air racing championship]]. The venue has varied but is still flown on most occasions around a Solent-based course, usually around September of each year.

==In popular culture==
*The Schneider Cup is frequently referred to in the 1992 animated film ''[[Porco Rosso]]'', even to the extent of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s naming the film's antagonist Donald Curtiss, a reference to American aircraft designers [[Glenn Curtiss]] and [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]].
*In the song "Bill Hosie" by [[Archie Fisher]], the [[protagonist]] rebuilds a [[Supermarine S.5]] [[seaplane]] that survived the 1927 Schneider Trophy Race. The plane, race, and trophy are referred to throughout the song. (Bill Hosie and the replica were both real. Hosie competed in the 1985 and 1986 DEC Schneider Trophy Races, and DEC partly financed his rebuild of the S.5 replica. He crashed during a test-flight of this replica on 23 May 1987, near Mylor, in Cornwall in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP673.PDF|title=Aviatrion safety review|date=May 1997|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|page=17|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; just one month before that year's DEC Schneider Trophy Race. Hosie was killed. Details of the crash and its cause are in AIB Bulletin 9/87 published by the [[Accidents Investigation Branch]] of the UK's [[Department for Transport|Department of Transport]], 1987.)
*The film ''[[The First of the Few]]'' (1942) starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as [[R. J. Mitchell]] centers on Mitchell's life as the designer of multiple Schneider Trophy–winning seaplanes and then the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighter plane.

'''Sean Christopher Avery''' (born April 10, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. During his career in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), he played left wing for the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Dallas Stars]] and [[New York Rangers]], gaining recognition for his [[Pest (ice hockey)|agitating]] playing style and controversial behaviour both on and off the ice. He is also known for his eclectic interests, having worked in fashion, most notably as an intern at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine; as a model; and as a restaurateur. He finished his 12-year career with a total of 90 goals, 247 points and 1,533 penalty minutes in 580 games.

After retiring in 2012, Avery began working at Lipman, an advertising and creative agency in New York City. He was promoted to senior staffer, but the firm closed without notice in September 2013, reportedly due to financial problems, later filing for bankruptcy, and owing Avery $229,167.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://nypost.com/2013/10/23/sean-avery-owed-229k-by-bankrupt-lipman-agency/|title = Sean Avery owed $229K by bankrupt Lipman agency|last = Claire Atkinson|date = October 23, 2013|work = New York Post|access-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's memoir, ''Ice Capades: A Memoir of Fast Living and Tough Hockey'', was published by [[Blue Rider Press]] in 2017.

Avery was born in [[North York, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://torontolife.com/city/nhl-fans-break-from-playoffs-to-discuss-gay-marriage-because-apparently-its-still-2006/|title = NHL fans break from playoffs to discuss gay marriage—because, apparently, it’s still 2006|last = John Michael McGrath|date = May 10, 2011|journal = Toronto Life|access-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Al and Marlene Avery, both teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Sampson, [http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/2008/10/23/Sean_Avery_Dressed_to_Kill.aspx “Sean Avery: Dressed to Kill”], ''[[D Magazine]]'', November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Pickering, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;John Dellapina, [http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/sean-avery-stand-toronto-article-1.276721 “Sean Avery: Can’t stand Toronto,”] ''[[New York Daily News]]'', December 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Dunbarton High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.faceoff.com/story.html?id=e5d6af76-c157-453b-8942-68d054411bf8&amp;k=83328&amp;add_feed_url=http://www.faceoff.com/news.atom|title = Avery disillusioned with Toronto hockey talk|date = December 6, 2007|accessdate = October 6, 2015|website = Faceoff.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094625/http://www.faceoff.com/story.html?id=e5d6af76-c157-453b-8942-68d054411bf8&amp;k=83328&amp;add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fnews.atom|archive-date = December 8, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother named Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://canadafreepress.com/article/2854|title = Sean Avery’s kid brother, Scott|date = April 30, 2008|accessdate = October 6, 2015|website = Canada Free Press|last = Judi McLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==

===Junior league (1996–2000)===
Prior to joining the NHL, Avery played for the [[Owen Sound Platers]] and the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL).

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–2003)===
Avery was signed by the Detroit Red Wings as a free agent in 1999. He played one final season in the OHL before turning professional in 2000 with the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He broke into the NHL in the [[2001–02 Detroit Red Wings season|2001–02 season]], playing 36 games with the Red Wings and 36 in the minors. The Red Wings went on to win the [[Stanley Cup]] that season, but Avery did not play in the playoffs nor did he play the required 41 games to get his name engraved on the Cup.

Midway through the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03 season]], Avery was traded to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] along with defenseman [[Maxim Kuznetsov]] and two draft picks for [[Mathieu Schneider]].&lt;ref name="mbrehm"&gt;Mike Brehm, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/wings/2003-03-11-schneider_x.htm “Red Wings acquire Schneider from Kings,”] ''[[USA Today]]'', March 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 15 points in 51 games.

===Los Angeles Kings and NHL lockout (2003–2007)===
[[Image:seanavery.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Avery with the Kings]]
In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], Avery played 76 games for the Kings, scoring 9 goals to go along with 19 assists. He also led the NHL in penalty minutes with 261.

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Avery briefly played in the [[Finnish Elite League]] with the [[Lahti Pelicans]], and in the [[United Hockey League]] for the [[Motor City Mechanics]]. Along with 149 penalty minutes in just 16 games, he tallied 26 points for the Mechanics, including two hat tricks, making him the first player in Mechanics history to record two hat tricks in one season. Several players spoke publicly of their dissatisfaction with the [[NHL Players' Association]]’s leadership during the lockout, including Avery, who publicly blamed NHLPA president Bob Goodenow for wasting an entire season with a battle that alienated fans and yielded few results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/07/06/avery050705.html|title=Top brass not at NHL bargaining table|work=CBC News|date=July 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery led the league in penalty minutes for the second consecutive season in 2005-06, with 257. With three games remaining, the Kings unofficially suspended Avery for the remainder of the season after he refused to do a drill in practice. Nevertheless, the team re-signed him to a one-year deal.&lt;ref name="cfoster"&gt;Chris Foster, [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/24/sports/sp-kings24 “Avery Gets One-Year Kings Deal,”] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with the Kings, Avery has been said to have mocked Dustin Brown about his lisp. Former Kings' teammate [[Ian Laperrière]] said it "was bullying, like you might see in high school."  But according to other players and coaches, Brown's lisp was not Avery's target, Brown's then girlfriend, now wife, Nicole was. Avery did not think Nicole Brown was glamorous enough to be a "girlfriend of a hockey player in Hollywood."  Brown admits the bullying might have affected him in ways that he did not realize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/25/sean-avery-used-to-mock-dustin-brown-about-his-lisp-and-wife/|title = Sean Avery used to mock Dustin Brown about his lisp and wife|date = April 25, 2012|last = Mike Halford|work = NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Rangers (2007–2008)===
[[Image:AveryNYR.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Avery in 2007]]
On February 5, 2007, in the middle of the 2006–07 season, Avery was traded to the New York Rangers.&lt;ref name="cfoster"/&gt; After joining the Rangers, he scored 20 points in 29 games to help the team complete a 17–4–6 end-of-season run to qualify for the playoffs. On March 17, Avery recorded a single-game career-high four points (one goal and three assists) against the [[Boston Bruins]] in a 7–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores107/107076/NHL706086.htm|title=Rangers 7, Bruins 0|work=USA Today|date=April 18, 2006|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery played in his first career playoff game on April 12 against the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], recording his first playoff points with a goal and an assist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/04/14/rangers-atlanta.html “Avery, Shanahan give Rangers 2-0 series lead,”] [[CBC Sports]], April 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He cut down on penalty minutes by about 65% in 2006–07 compared to seasons past.

On August 1, 2007, Avery, as a restricted free agent, earned an [[arbitration]] award of $1.9 million for the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], which the Rangers accepted, keeping him with the team for at least another year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nhl&amp;id=2957420 “Rangers re-sign LW Sean Avery after arbitrator awards him $1.9 million salary,”] [[ESPN]], August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2008, in a game against the [[Buffalo Sabres]], Avery scored a goal 10 seconds into the game, setting a record for fastest goal scored by a Ranger on home ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2008021613|title = Avery scores twice, Rangers rout Sabres and Miller with 4 in 1st|agency = Associated Press|last = Podell|first = Ira|date = February 16, 2008|accessdate = October 6, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023080048/http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2008021613|archive-date = October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dallas Stars (2008)===
Avery signed a four-year, $15.5 million contract with the [[Dallas Stars]] on July 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=450364 “Stars Sign Sean Avery,”] stars.nhl.com, July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a roommate of the Stars' co-general manager [[Brett Hull]] when the two played for the Red Wings. Hull thought the Stars needed more fire and emotion on the ice, and felt Avery would fit the bill. Avery scored 3 goals in 23 games before he and the team parted ways following his six-game suspension by the NHL in December 2008, due to controversial remarks made about fellow players.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Heika, [http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/11147983 “Dallas Stars frustrated with suspended Avery's actions,”] ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stars placed Avery on waivers on February 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nhl&amp;id=3891428 “Stars place left winger Avery on waivers,”] ESPN, February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsnhartford"&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=266456&amp;lid=sublink01&amp;lpos=headlines_nhl;_ylt=AurPHuBcie0o6v6Jnqxv1zgLMxIF “Stars Assign Avery to Rangers’ AHL Affiliate in Hartford,”] [[The Sports Network|TSN]], February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the Rangers (2009–2012)===
[[Image:SeanAvery2009.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Avery in the 2009 playoffs]]
After clearing [[Waivers (NHL)|waivers]] on February 9, 2009, Avery was assigned to the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]], the Rangers' AHL affiliate, although he remained a member of the Stars organization (that season, the Stars had no AHL affiliate).&lt;ref name="tsnhartford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3896515 Stars send Avery to Hartford] ESPN, February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, Avery was placed on re-entry waivers by Dallas, and claimed by the Rangers the following day.&lt;ref name="espn030309"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3948668 “Rangers take Avery off waivers,”] ESPN, March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2010, in a game against the Stars, his former team, Avery recorded one goal and three assists.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Z. Klein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/sports/hockey/07nhl.html “Avery Comes Alive Against the Stars, His Ex-Team,”] ''[[New York Times]]'', January 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2011, the Rangers waived Avery. The following day, he cleared waivers and was assigned to New York’s affiliate, the [[Connecticut Whale (AHL)|Connecticut Whale]] of the AHL.&lt;ref name="tsn100511"&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=377498 "Avery clears waivers, sent to AHL; Staal on injured list,"] TSN, October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2011, the Rangers placed Avery on 24-hour re-entry waivers. The move was done to bring him up as a replacement for the injured Mike Rupp. He cleared waivers and re-joined the Rangers for their November 5 game against the Montreal Canadiens.&lt;ref name="lbooks103111"&gt;Larry Books, [https://nypost.com/2011/10/31/rangers-put-avery-on-re-entry-waivers/ “Rangers put Avery on re-entry waivers,”] ''[[New York Post]]'', October 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite playing less than 10 minutes in all 15 games he played for the Rangers that season, he scored 3 goals. After being a healthy scratch for nine games, Avery was once again placed on waivers on December 30, 2011. Since no NHL team claimed him, he returned to the AHL's Connecticut Whale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7407681/sean-avery-clears-waivers-headed-ahl-now Sean Avery clears waivers]. espn.com (December 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; His last game played with the Whale was on January 27, 2012. He was left off the Whale's Clear Day list of players eligible to play for the remainder of the AHL season submitted on March 5, and told to no longer report to games or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Strang, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7654673/sean-avery-tenure-new-york-rangers-franchise-over “AHL’s Whale done with Sean Avery,”] ESPN, March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2012, Avery retired. He announced his retirement on ''Watch What Happens Live'' with host [[Andy Cohen (television personality)|Andy Cohen]].&lt;ref name="lbooks031412"&gt;Larry Books, [https://nypost.com/2012/03/14/former-rangers-forward-avery-calls-it-quits/ “Former Rangers forward Avery calls it quits,”] ''New York Post'', March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Strang, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7681867/new-york-rangers-sean-avery-says-officially-retired “Sean Avery talks retirement,”] ESPN, March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Over the course of his hockey career, Avery was involved in a number of controversies and fined by the NHL on numerous occasions. The controversy started early in his career; Red Wings general manager [[Ken Holland]] said he unloaded Avery during the 2002–03 season partly because he didn't seem to have respect for the game.&lt;ref name="Mature"&gt;Rosen, Dan; and Adam Kimelman. [http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=396369 Holland: "Avery hasn't matured"]. NHL.com, 2008-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leukemia comment===
In November 2007, Howard Berger a reporter for Toronto radio station [[FAN 590]] stated that an unnamed Rangers player had accused Avery of commenting about [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] player [[Jason Blake (ice hockey)|Jason Blake]]'s battle with leukemia, prior to a pre-game confrontation between Avery and Toronto's [[Darcy Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10470990 “Controversial incidents involving Sean Avery”], [[CBS Sports]], November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Avery, who denied the allegation, received an NHL-maximum $2500 fine, and Tucker received a $1000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/2007/11/13/did-sean-avery-make-comments-about-jason-blakes-fight-with-cancer “Did Sean Avery Make Comments About Jason Blake’s Fight With Cancer?”], ''[[CityNews]]'', November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Avery Rule===
[[Image:Averyrule.jpg|right|thumb|Avery "screening" Brodeur]]
On April 13, 2008, during game three of a first round [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoff]] game against the [[New Jersey Devils]], Avery turned his back on the play in order to face and [[Screen (ice hockey)|screen]] Devils goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] during a two-man advantage on the power play. He waved his hands and stick in front of Brodeur in an attempt to distract him and block his view. The puck was later cleared out of the Devils' zone but on the second Rangers offensive attack, Avery scored a power play goal.

Although screening is a commonly used tactic (especially on the power play), notable in this instance was that Avery had spent the initial part of the play facing Brodeur while ignoring the puck, with his back to the play (normally, the player screening the goaltender is facing the play). The following day, the NHL issued an interpretation of the league's unsportsmanlike conduct rule to cover actions such as the one employed by Avery, which would now result in a minor penalty.&lt;ref name="ESPN.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3346729|title=NHL amends unsportsmanlike conduct rule in response to Avery's antics|publisher=ESPN|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known colloquially as "The Avery Rule".&lt;ref name="The Demon on His Shoulder,"&gt;Allen Salkin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/fashion/29avery.html?pagewanted=all “The Demon on His Shoulder,”] ''New York Times'', March 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's tactics during that series against the Devils earned multiple power plays, and he scored in each of the first three games. His controversial yet effective antics helped lead the Rangers to a 4–1 series win. At the end of the series, Brodeur refused to shake Avery's hand. In an interview after game 5 when asked about the handshake line, Avery replied, "Fatso forgot to shake my hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2009/03/sean_avery_gets_best_of_new_je.html|title=Sean Avery gets best of New Jersey Devils in New York Rangers' 3–0 victory|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heckling incident===
[[Image:Sean Avery rangers 2011-02-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Avery during the 2010–11 season]]
On November 1, 2008, following a game with the Stars against the Boston Bruins, Avery was accused of shouting obscenities at a fan who had been heckling him during the game. A report of complaint was filed with the NHL, but no action was taken.&lt;ref name="sburnside"&gt;Scott Burnside, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=3740622 “Isolated incident? No, Avery’s career has been defined by indiscretions,”] ESPN, December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sloppy seconds" comment===
On December 2, 2008, prior to the Stars' morning skate in preparation for a game against the [[Calgary Flames]], Avery approached the assembled reporters in the dressing room and stated, “I just want to comment on how it's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my [[Sloppy seconds (sexual practice)|sloppy seconds]]. I don't know what that's about, but enjoy the game tonight.” At the time, two of Avery's ex-girlfriends were dating fellow NHL players - actress [[Elisha Cuthbert]] was dating Flames defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]], and model [[Rachel Hunter]] was dating Kings center [[Jarret Stoll]].&lt;ref name="sburnside"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10470990 “Controversial incidents involving Sean Avery”], CBS Sports, November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=remarkcbc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/12/05/avery-suspension-stars.html “Avery to sit 6 games for controversial remark,”] CBC Sports, December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the NHL suspended Avery indefinitely for "conduct detrimental to the league or the game of hockey". His comments were met with near-unanimous condemnation by the Stars organization, fellow players, and fans alike. Stars owner [[Tom Hicks]] said that the team would have suspended Avery had the NHL not acted first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=395722|title=NHL statement on Avery suspension}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery apologized the next day, calling his actions "inappropriate" and "a bad attempt to build excitement for the game".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3743305 Stars LW Avery issues apology for televised comments about ex-girlfriends]. [[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]]; 2008-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, the NHL fixed Avery's suspension at six games, retroactive to the December 2 game against the Flames. He agreed to undergo anger management counseling due to what the NHL called unacceptable and antisocial behavior. [[NHL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]] noted that both he and league disciplinarian [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey)|Colin Campbell]] had warned Avery several times before about his behaviour.&lt;ref name=remarkcbc/&gt; On December 14, after the last game of Avery's suspension, the Stars announced that Avery would not return to the team. One factor in the Stars decision was that coach [[Dave Tippett]] and several of the players, including [[Mike Modano]] and [[Marty Turco]], let it be known they weren't willing to take him back on the team. Tippett had warned Avery not to talk to the media about his former girlfriends, and was outraged when he did so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=259679 Avery to continue counseling, will not return to Stars], TSN.ca, 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3768552 Stars: Avery will not return]. ESPN, 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s [[James Duthie (sportscaster)|James Duthie]], Avery's teammates had soured on him not long after he arrived. The "sloppy seconds" incident was the last straw, and Hicks had been actively looking to cut ties with him while the suspension was underway.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Duthie (sportscaster)|Duthie, James]]. [http://www2.tsn.ca/columnists/james_duthie/?id=258309 Avery's teammates hope "indefinitely" means "forever"], [[The Sports Network]], 2008-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tortorella feud===
Prior to his second stint with the Rangers, Avery had been called out on numerous occasions by then TSN commentator and future Rangers coach [[John Tortorella]], who is noted for his no-nonsense behavior with his players and the press. After rejoining the Rangers, Avery’s relationship with Tortorella was uneasy, although in Avery's book he reports there were moments of mutual admiration. Nearly a year after Avery retired, on March 30, 2013, following the Rangers’ second consecutive shutout loss, a tweet from Avery's [[Twitter]] account said of his former coach, “Fire this CLOWN, his players hate him and wont play for his BS.”&lt;ref&gt;Greg Wyshynski, [https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/sean-avery-had-huge-smile-over-john-tortorella-151814254.html “Sean Avery had ‘huge smile’ over John Tortorella’s firing by Rangers,”] [[Yahoo!

I’m happy for the Rangers and Ranger fans.”&lt;ref name="lbooks053113"/&gt;

==Advertising==

===Lipman Agency===
Upon his retirement from the NHL, in April 2012, Avery began working at New York City-based advertising and creative agency Lipman. Hired by founder, chairman and chief creative officer David Lipman, Avery was appointed chief strategic officer and helped develop strategies for numerous Lipman clients, including the campaign for the [[Stuart Weitzman]] line’s Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, featuring [[Kate Moss]], and [[7 For All Mankind]] jeans, which showcased Avery himself as a model. He has also handled a range of assignments for Lipman’s parent company, Revolate Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Elliott, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/business/media/sean-avery-is-not-the-average-ad-executive.html?_r=1&amp; “From Madison Square Garden to Madison Avenue,”] ''New York Times'', December 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twtmob===
Avery is invested in Twtmob (pronounced “tweet mob”), which connects users with advertisers and campaigns, enabling users to monetize [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and other social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Red, [http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/avery-pulling-hank-torts-article-1.1346409 “Sean Avery, happy in his second career, rooting for Henrik Lundqvist, NY Rangers and even John Tortorella,”] ''[[New York Daily News]]'', May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, it was announced that Avery would be spending the summer offseason interning at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/memopad/article/124369|title=Memo Pad: And his qualifications are?...

==Restaurants==

===Warren 77===
In the summer of 2009, Avery opened Warren 77, a sports bar named after its address in [[Manhattan]]’s [[Tribeca]] neighborhood at 77 Warren Street. On opening night, many figures from the hockey world were present, including [[Brendan Shanahan]], [[Ken Daneyko]] and [[Henrik Lundqvist]]. The décor was meant to reflect an old New York style, with [[Andy Warhol]] originals and pictures of icons on the walls, as well as pictures of the New York Rangers, past and present. Matt Abramcyk, a former art dealer, and Chris Miller, co-owner of the Beatrice Hotel, are co-owners of the bar.&lt;ref name="The Demon on His Shoulder,"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Mathews, [http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-interview-sean-avery-on-warren-77/#1 “Interview: Sean Avery on Warren 77,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021134741/http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-interview-sean-avery-on-warren-77/#1 |date=October 21, 2011 }} ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', June 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Thompson, [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/tables/2009/09/28/090928gota_GOAT_tables_thompson “Tables for Two: Warren 77,”] ''[[The New Yorker]]'', September 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery handled day-to-day operations, including occasionally bussing tables.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Fickenscher, Matthew Flamm and Adrianne Pasquarelli, [http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110501/SUB/305019976 “Two Rangers’ new eatery Tiny’s breaks the ice”], ''[[Crain's New York Business]]'', May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Avery had sold his interests in both Warren 77 and Tiny's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagesix.com/2013/08/31/exiting-eateries/ “Exiting eateries,”] ''New York Post'', August 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9325">'''Strategic enrollment management''' ['''SEM'''] is a crucial element of planning for new growth at a [[university]] or [[college]] as it concerns both academic program growth and facilities needs. {{ref|western}} SEM focuses on what is best for students' success while increasing enrollment numbers and stabilizing institutional revenues. A [[Student|student's]] success, according to an enrollment manager, is often based on the institution's graduation and retention rates. This means that students are often recruited based on the likelihood of them graduating. While this practice is acceptable for many privately run selective institutions, it is not a common practice of most public institutions such as community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationalpolicy.org/pdf/SEM%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A real strategic enrollment management approach looks at the entire student cycle, from entry through graduation. {{ref|inside}}

According to Thomas Williams {{ref|williams}} [[enrollment management]] refers to the traditional task of “setting and meeting the goal of assembling a student body that comprises a predetermined and advantageous mix of students in terms of quality, number, and diversity in all its forms.”  strategic enrollment management is a broader, more dynamic task that begins with an understanding of the world around us, anticipates changes, probes institutional mission and goals, modifying them if necessary, and coordinates “campus-wide efforts in such areas as marketing, student recruitment and retention, tuition pricing, financial aid, academic and career counseling, and curriculum reform.”

Often, SEM is understood to be focused on a college or university's traditional undergraduate students, and mobilized to meet the needs of the traditional college student. An additional area of SEM has been developed to apply these principles to the graduate student lifecycle: [[Graduate enrollment management|Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM)]]. SEM focuses on the unique services and facilities needs specific to the adult graduate student.

Some of the components of strategic enrollment management include: {{ref|southeast}}
* Characteristics of the institution and the world around it
* Institutional mission and priorities
* Optimal enrollments (number, quality, diversity)
* Student recruitment
* Student fees and [[Student financial aid (United States)|Financial aid]]
* Retention
* Institutional marketing
* [[Career counseling]] and development
* Academic advising
* Curricular and program development
* Methods of program delivery
* Quality of campus life and facilities

==History==

The Evolution of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) resulted from the work of a number of people and organizations since schools started being concerned with this area in the early 1970s. Boston College (through the work of Jack Maguire in 1976)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maguireassoc.com/about/our-staff/&lt;/ref&gt; and Northwestern University (through the work of William Ihlanfeldt)[2] began to use research and specific communication strategies to increase enrollment at their schools. The idea of research and using the data to target communication and marketing efforts resulted in positive enrollment numbers and drew several entrepreneurs into the field of managing enrollments. Jack Maguire subsequently created and named the first enrollment management model for recruitment and retention of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/pub/emr/EMR-spring-2007.pdf/|title=Recruitment &amp; Admissions – Higher Ed Services - Education Professionals – The College Board|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Stuart Weiner and Drs. Ron and Dori Ingersoll formed one of the earliest teams that addressed enrollment issues from the point of view of the total enrollment effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enrollment-management.com/page13.php&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the Ingersolls and others made enrollment efforts more effective by strategically addressing schools, data, academic offerings, and student services—and included retention in the overall effort.

In the late 1970s, the practice of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) was born. Since that time, organizations such as Noel-Levitz, Williams and Associates, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) have continued to refine the concept.

But it wasn’t until 1990 that AACRAO established the term, “Strategic Enrollment Management”, and started the first annual SEM conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/Professional-Development/meetings/2013SEM/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; specifically focused on pressing issues and effective practices in Strategic Enrollment Management.  Beginning in 2009, AACRAO developed the first SEM Award of Excellence to recognize outstanding achievement and visionary leadership in Strategic Enrollment Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/About-AACRAO/governance-and-leadership/leadership/awards/semaward.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Bontrager, Sr. Director of AACRAO Consulting and SEM Initiatives edited some of the first books on SEM:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/professional-development/meetings/past-meetings/2012ExecSymposium/KeynoteSpeakers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''SEM and Institutional Success: Integrating Enrollment, Finance and Student Access'' (2008)
* ''Applying SEM at the Community College'' (2009)

In 2012, Dr. Ron Ingersoll and Dr. Dori Ingersoll, with Dr. Bob Bontrager, co-edited the book ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education''.  This SEM compendium was published for the higher education profession by AACRAO. EMAS Pro then initiated the industry’s first monthly Strategic Enrollment Management webinar series, as a companion to the ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education'' book.&lt;ref&gt;http://emaspro.com/news-events/seminar-series/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ingersolls serve as primary SEMinar session co-presenters.

In recent years, AACRAO has published additional books on SEM that include:
* ''SEM in Canada: Promoting Student and Institutional Success in Canadian Colleges and Universities'' (2011)
* ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Educations'' (2012)
* ''Handbook of Strategic Enrollment Management'' (2014)
* ''SEM Core Concepts: Building Blocks for Institutional and Student Success'' (2017)

==Software==

As enrollment moved from a focus on marketing to including the whole institution, the need grew for software that offered better ways to communicate and work with students and parents.  In the mid-1980s, the Ingersoll Group and Tom Williams developed the first software to effectively manage the process for students from inquiry to enrollment. This was The Enrollment Management Action System (EMAS™).

Noel-Levitz had developed Dialogue, a Telecounseling software designed for higher education.  When Noel-Levitz merged with Williams Crockett, the telecounseling package was merged into EMAS to create EMAS''Plus''—a software system that addressed recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noellevitz.com/about-noel-levitz/the-history-of-noel-levitz|title=The History of Ruffalo Noel Levitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Education Systems Inc. purchased EMAS products to add to software they developed for work with financial aid. At this point, the emphasis was still primarily on marketing and communication efforts. Education Systems, Inc. (doing business as EMAS™ Pro) expanded the original higher-education CRM software into a resource to address the total commitment of schools to manage their enrollment from a strategic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emaspro.com/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, a number of vendors serving Higher Education have emerged with CRM systems such as Hobsons, [[Jenzabar]], Talisma and Target X.

Student CRM by Data Harvesting is also a growing popular choice for a student recruitment solution for universities and colleges.

==Common misconceptions==
According to Bontrager and Kerlin {{ref|bontrager}}, common misconceptions and sometimes barriers to implementing or moving strategic enrollment management forward within an institution are that strategic enrollment management is:
* a quick fix
* solely an organizational structure
* an enhanced admissions and marketing operation
* a financial drain on the institution
* an administrative function separate from the academic plan and mission of the institution

The '''Swedish Trade Council''' ({{lang-sv|Exportrådet, or Sveriges Exportråd}}) was an organisation formed after a parliamentary decision July 1, 1972 in cooperation between the [[Government of Sweden]] and representatives from the Swedish business community, through the Swedish Foreign Trade Association ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Allmänna Utrikeshandelsförening}}). Its mission was to promote Swedish exports on behalf of the Swedish industry and government.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 1972:31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the organisation was merged with the government agency [[Invest Sweden]], to form a new organisation named [[Business Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Sweden - ny organisation för ökad export och investeringsfrämjande|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/16916/a/207093|publisher=[[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728015008/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/16916/a/207093|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''Tag-along right''' ('''TAR''') is a legal concept in corporate law.

Under the concept, if the majority shareholder(s) of an entity sells their stake, the remaining [[Minority interest|minority shareholders]] have the right to join the deal and to sell their shares at the same terms and conditions as the majority shareholder(s), and the new owner must purchase those interests as well.

This right protects minority shareholders from being potentially forced to sell their shares for less than the majority shareholder(s) (as, after the deal, they likely would have no ability to outvote the new owner(s) who would have majority control).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tagalongrights.asp Tag-Along Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Tag-along rights are fairly standard terms in [[shareholders agreement]]s.

The concept differs from the [[drag-along right]], in that under the latter the minority shareholders '''''must''''' sell their interests (though they also obtain the same terms and conditions as the majority shareholder).

A '''tarpaulin''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|ɑr|p|əl|ɪ|n}} {{respell|TAR|pəl|in}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/definition/tarpaulin|title=tarpaulin - Dictionary Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|t|ɑr|ˈ|p|ɔː|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|tar|PAW|lin}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/tarpaulin|title=tarpaulin - Definition of tarpaulin in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''tarp''', is a large sheet of strong, flexible, water-resistant or [[waterproof]] material, often [[cloth]] such as [[canvas]] or [[polyester]] coated with [[polyurethane]], or made of [[plastic]]s such as [[polyethylene]]. In some places such as [[Australia]], and in military slang, a tarp may be known as a '''hootch'''. Tarpaulins often have reinforced [[grommet]]s at the corners and along the sides to form attachment points for [[rope]], allowing them to be tied down or suspended.

Inexpensive modern tarpaulins are made from woven [[polyethylene]]; this material is so associated with tarpaulins that it has become colloquially known in some quarters as '''polytarp'''.

==Etymology==
The word ''tarpaulin'' originated as a [[compound word|compound]] of the words ''tar'' and ''palling'', referring to a [[tar]]red canvas pall used to cover objects on [[ships]]. Sailors often tarred their own overclothes in the same manner as the sheets or palls. By association, [[sailors]] became known as "jack tars".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tar Tar], ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, "paulin" was used for such a cloth; here [[General Rosecrans]] tells a subordinate how to improvise a boat:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A boat has been ordered up, but to make sure a large paulin will be sent down to you, with which, spread under a lot of wagon-beds, you will be able to make a large scow."
(''War of the Rebellion: Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies'', series 1, volume 5, page 260, November 1861)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Two wagon beds&amp;nbsp;... were placed upon frames&amp;nbsp;... Thus constructed, they were placed upon a [[cotton duck|duck]] paulin, which was drawn up tightly around the beds and secured."
(''Ibid.'', page 275)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:WRESTLEMANIA.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A tarpaulin is used at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] (2008) to prevent rain from falling on the performers and stage equipment.]]

Tarpaulins have multiple uses, including as shelter from the elements, i.e., [[wind]], [[rain]], or [[sunlight]], a [[Tent#Parts|ground sheet]]. Tarpaulins are often used during the build process to protect brickwork and masonry from weather damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/477290692|title=Brickwork : for CAA Construction Diploma and NVQs. Level 2|last=(Malcolm)|first=Thorpe, M.|date=2010|publisher=Newnes|others=Hodge, J. C. (John Charles)|isbn=9781856177658|location=Oxford|oclc=477290692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarpaulins are also used for a [[fly (tent)|fly]] in [[camping]], a drop sheet for [[painting]], for protecting the infield of a [[baseball field]], and for protecting objects, such as unenclosed [[truck]]s, [[semi-trailer]]s or [[freight car]]s as well as [[wood pile]]s. Such was the demand for tarpaulins by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]], up until 1990, they operated their own tarpaulin factory.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank. ''A short History of the Tarpaulin Factory at Enfield.'' [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]. September, 1999. pp. 343-347&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used on outdoor market stalls to provide some protection from the elements of nature.
Tarpaulins are also used for advertisement printing, most notably for billboards.

Another historical use of a tarpaulin is to cover seats in a stadium that are rarely used, are in venues oversized for a venue, or are obstructed view seats in a [[multi-purpose stadium]] or indoor arena for a certain sport. The entire third deck of the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]] is also covered in tarp for [[Oakland Athletics]] games, but is uncovered for [[Oakland Raiders]] games, while portions of the upper deck [[CenturyLink Field]] in [[Seattle]] are covered with images of the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] crest or sponsor logos in games which do not require use of that seating.

Perforated tarpaulins are typically used for medium to large [[advertising]], or for protection on scaffoldings, the aim of the perforations (from 20% to 70%) is to reduce wind vulnerability. 
[[Image:perforated pvc tarp.jpg|thumb|right|An example of perforated tarpaulin]]

Polyethylene tarpaulins have also proven to be a popular source when an inexpensive, water resistant fabric is needed. Many amateur builders of [[plywood]] [[sailboat]]s turn to polyethylene tarpaulins for making their sails, as it is inexpensive and easily worked. With the proper type of [[adhesive tape]], it is possible to make a serviceable [[polytarp sails|sail]] for a small boat with no [[sewing]].

Plastic tarps are sometimes used as a building material in communities of indigenous North Americans.&lt;ref name="dear-listener-program"/&gt; Tipis made with tarps are known as [[tarpees]].&lt;ref name="hopper"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper |first1=Frank |title="Those Are Sacred": A First-Person Account From the Tipi Demonstration That Shut Down Traffic |url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/05/10/26161615/those-are-sacred-a-first-person-account-from-the-tipi-demonstration-that-shut-down-traffic |accessdate=16 July 2018 |newspaper=The Stranger |date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Tarpaulins can be classified based on a diversity of factors, such as material type ([[polyethylene]], [[canvas]], [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]], etc.), thickness, which is generally measured in [[Thousandth of an inch|mils]] or generalized into categories (such as "regular duty", "heavy duty", "super heavy duty", etc.), and [[grommet]] strength (simple vs. reinforced), among others.

Tarpaulins can also be classified by size—a common determining factor for consumers in acquiring tarps—and measured in [[width]] by [[length]]. Actual tarp sizes are generally about three to five percent smaller than the advertised size. (Thus, a tarp advertised as {{cvt|20|x|20|ft}} will actually measure about {{cvt|19|x|19|ft}}.) Some other factors that may influence a purchase decision include color (often they come in blue, green, black, or silver), grommet type ([[aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], etc.), and grommet-to-grommet distance (these often run between {{cvt|18|in}} and {{cvt|5|ft}}). The [[Weaving|weave count]], a measure of tarp strength, often runs between (8 and 12 per square inch) and the greater the count, the greater its resistance against ripping in high wind conditions. Tarps may also be washable or non-washable and [[waterproof]] or non-waterproof, and [[rot-proof|mildewproof]] vs. non-mildewproof. Tarp [[flexibility]] refers to its ability to remain pliable during cold winter months; some tarps offer more flexibility than others in cold weather. Some manufacturers also advertise their tarps as "rot-proof", but this may be more a subjective than an objective measurement.

===Type of material ===

==== Polyethylene ====
[[File:NationalCityPNC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tarp is used to identify a business.]]

A [[polyethylene]] tarpaulin ("polytarp") is not a traditional fabric, but rather, a [[laminate]] of woven and sheet material. The center is loosely woven from strips of [[polyethylene]] plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface. This creates a fabric-like material that resists stretching well in all directions and is waterproof. Sheets can be either of [[low density polyethylene]] (LDPE) or [[high density polyethylene]] (HDPE). When treated against [[ultraviolet]] light, these tarpaulins can last for years exposed to the elements, but non-[[UV]] treated material will quickly become brittle and lose strength and water resistance if exposed to sunlight.

====Canvas====
[[Canvas]] tarpaulins are not 100% waterproof, though they are water resistant. Thus, while a little bit of water for a short period of time will not affect them, when there is standing water on canvas tarps, or when water cannot quickly drain away from canvas tarps, the standing water will drip through this type of tarp.

====Vinyl====
[[Polyvinyl chloride]] ("vinyl") tarpaulins are industrial-grade and intended for heavy-duty use. They are constructed of {{cvt|10|oz/sqyd|g/m2}} coated yellow vinyl. This makes it waterproof and have high [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and tear strength. These resist oil, acid, grease and [[mildew]]. The vinyl tarp is ideal for agriculture, construction, industrial and trucks.

==== Silnylon ====
{{main|silnylon}}

[[Tarp tent]]s may be made of [[silnylon]].

===U.S. Color Scheme===
For years manufacturers have used a [[color code]] to indicate the grade of tarpaulins, but not all manufacturers follow this traditional method of grading. Following this color-coded system, blue indicates a lightweight tarp, and typically has a weave count of 8×8 and a thickness of {{cvt|0.005|-|0.006|in}}. Silver is a heavy-duty tarp and typically has a weave count of 14×14 and a thickness of {{cvt|0.011|-|0.012|in}}.

Some of the more common colors in that scheme are:
:{|class=wikitable
!Color!!Name!!Approx. thickness
|-
|Blue||light-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.005|-|0.006|in}}
|-
|Yellow/Orange||medium-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.007|-|0.008|in}}
|-
|Green||medium-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.009|-|0.010|in}}
|-
|Silver||heavy-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.011|-|0.012|in}}
|-
|Brown||super-heavy-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.016|in}}

Tarps have been used both within works of art, and also to conceal works of art from public view.

A 2017 work called ''Tarp'' by Amy Malbeuf consists of a blue tarp with the word "tarp" written on it in glass beads. The work was created in reference to the use of tarps in improvised shelters by [[Homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area|people who are homeless in Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Brandon |title=Reality Check: Oakland’s Museum of Capitalism |journal=Art in America |date=17 July 2017 |url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/reality-check-oaklandrsquos-museum-of-capitalism/ |accessdate=16 July 2018 |quote=Some works more or less iterate the Museum’s core concept of radical denial. Alberta-based Métis artist Amy Malbeuf’s ''Tarp'' (2017), for instance, represents the fantasy the Museum asks us to assume. The work is a big blue tarpaulin on the wall, with the word tarp inscribed on it with glass beads. The wall text describes the piece in a voice from the future. It defines what a tarp 'was' in 2017, and then provides context: “In cities like Oakland, where capitalist development drove people out of homes, tarps became an important part of the improvised shelters which often appeared at the margins of urban areas.” While there is no doubt in my mind that Malbeuf made the piece in sympathy for and in solidarity with the staggering homeless population in Oakland, the fantasy risks increasing the conceptual distance between museumgoers and the displaced by making the reality of this crisis contrafactually pluperfect.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American artist [[Nicholas Galanin]]'s 2018 retrospective art show ''Dear Listener'' at the [[Heard Museum]] included tarps as both elements of sculpture and as part of the gallery presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Jenna |title=Nicholas Galanin's "Dear Listener" with Curator Erin Joyce |journal=Java Magazine |date=5 June 2018 |url=http://javamagaz.com/?p=5078 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |quote=The artist and curator asked Heard Museum to drape the skylights in blue plastic tarps, not just for mood but also to pay tribute to the many uses of this inexpensive resource in Native communities. These tarps are often used to patch leaky roofs, cover damaged car windows and as temporary shelters and sheds. The blue plastic tarps are so ubiquitous, there’s even a nickname for homes made out of them – 'tarp-ees.' The blue tarps appear 'because they are readily accessible and very inexpensive. A lot of people are living below the poverty line on reservations,' Joyce explains ... 'Creation With Her Children,' is a collaboration with Galanin’s partner, artist Merritt Johnson. A blue plastic tarp peeks out as a layer of the woman’s petticoat. Her children are animals who gather at her feet, beneath the folds of her gown. In one hand she holds a mirror, and in the other she holds a knife, gazing at her reflection while carving her own face 'out of necessity.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture ''Creation with Her Children'', a collaboration between Galanin and Merritt Johnson, depicts Creation clothed in a gown made from a blue plastic tarp. While Creation carves her own face, her children, depicted as animals who have human hands, are gathered near her feet. According to the gallery text and the printed program, the tarp, which is "used heavily in indigenous communities," references "contemporary Indigenous life and the long standing effects of forced relocation under colonial rule."&lt;ref name="dear-listener-program"&gt;{{cite book |title=Printed program for Dear Listener: Works by Nicholas Galanin |date=2018 |quote=Creation with Her Children: In this work Galanin collaborated with artist Merritt Johnson. The two depict a female figure, Creation. Creation is shown carving her own face out of necessity. Her ensemble, a 17th-century style European gown, consists of a variety of materials — most notably a blue plastic tarp. The blue tarp — used heavily in Indigenous communities, creating protection from the elements, and even employed to build tipis known as ''tarpees'' — references contemporary Indigenous life and the long standing effects of forced relocation under colonial rule. Her children, two animals with human hands peeking out from under her skirt, do not emerge. They expose their sharp teeth — an act of self-defense from the world they would encounter should they leave the protection of their mother ... Blue Tarp Skylight: The decision to place blue plastic tarps over the skylights in the Dennis Lyon Family Crossroads Gallery was deliberate choice made by Erin Joyce, the Museum's Fine Arts Curator. No, the roof is not leaking or in need of repair, however the tarps do serve a critical function in the exhibition space. Firstly, they work to illuminate the use of blue plastic tarps in Indigenous North America as a cost-effective and readily available tool used to repair roofs, build tipis and various other applications. Secondly, it casts a luminous blue glow down into the gallery — which creates an atmospheric feeling of coolness, playing off the presence of a polar bear placed in the center of the room — but it is all artificial. It serves to create a reminder that we live in a borrowed landscape, under artificial light and in air-conditioned spaces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the galleries housing ''Dear Listener,'' the skylights have been covered with blue tarps. The decision to do so 
was made by a museum curator in reference to the use of tarps in Indigenous North America as an inexpensive and widely available material used for building and repair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">'''Victor Harold Vroom''' (born August 9, 1932,&lt;ref&gt;[http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50013142.html VIAF]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada) is a business school professor at the [[Yale School of Management]]. He holds a [[PhD]] from [[University of Michigan]] and an [[Master of Science|MS]] and [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] from [[McGill University]].

His most well-known books are '''''Work and Motivation''''', '''''Leadership and Decision Making''''' and '''''The New Leadership'''''. Vroom has also been a consultant to a number of corporations such as [[GE]] and [[American Express]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[File:Virginia and Walter Rathbone Bacon with relatives and friends.jpg|thumb|Circa 1892. Seated: Walter Rathbone Bacon, Gifford Pinchot, Virginia P. Bacon; Standing: Emily Sloane, Adele Sloane, George Vanderbilt]]

In 1882, in [[Bordeaux]], France, Bacon married [[Virginia P. Bacon|Virginia Purdy Barker]], the youngest granddaughter of business magnate, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', Friday March 10, issue 1785 (London: 1882), p. 1. Accessed through ''19th Century British Library Newspapers Part II''&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon and his wife spent most of their time abroad, particularly in London and at Netherdale Estate, their Manor house in [[Turriff]], Scotland. However, after the outbreak of [[World War I]] travel to Europe became more difficult and the Bacons remained in New York.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25589459?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''American Art News'', April 12, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Register, Summer ...: Contains the Summer Addresses of Residents of New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and Baltimore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|year=1913|publisher=Social Register Association|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter, with his brother [[Edward R. Bacon]], a lawyer, acted as president of the Knickerbocker Apartments at 247 Fifth Avenue, where the two lived with Walter's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/15/102650638.html?pageNumber=13 ''New York Times'' November 15, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ldpd_5767518_000#page/n23/mode/2up| ''The Elite of New York, Society List and Club' Register'', New York, 1915, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Knickerbocker apartments, in William B. Duncan's former mansion, were sold to the newly formed gentlemen's club, the [[Knickerbocker Club]]. The Knickerbocker club was formed out of the [[Union Club of the City of New York]], by a group of members exasperated with the admittance of younger, less traditional members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-lost-1882-knickerbocker-apartments.html Tom Miller, ''The Lost 1882 Knickerbocker Apartments'', September 3, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Walter was also a member of [[Racquet and Tennis Club]], in New York and The [[Reform Club]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJVYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=walter+rathbone+bacon+reform+club&amp;dq=walter+rathbone+bacon+reform+club&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6wEwAGoVChMI4YKinK-mxwIVAVc-Ch22GQDk| D.
