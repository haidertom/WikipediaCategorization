'''AeDES''' (Agibilità e Danno nell'Emergenza Sismica) is a printed Rapid Post-Earthquake Damage Evaluation form, from [[GDNT]] (Italian national seismic protection group). It is used by [[Italians|Italian]] qualified [[civil engineers]] to assess the structural damages of buildings after an [[earthquake]].
The AeDES Form is used from the civil protection technical staff since June 1998 to survey damages in the after-shock. The form has 9 sections. This tool allows for the definition of the conformity or non-conformity of a building. 
The form is scanned and digitized for further evaluations. Information about position of the building, classification, material, structural typology, damage of the current event and previous damages are object of this form.

'''Ancient art''' refers to the many types of [[art]] produced by the advanced [[culture]]s of [[ancient]] societies with some form of writing, such as those of ancient [[China]], [[India]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Ancient Palestine|Palestine]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The art of pre-literate societies is normally referred to as [[Prehistoric art]] and is not covered here.  Although some [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] developed writing during the centuries before the arrival of Europeans, on grounds of dating these are covered at [[Pre-Columbian art]], and articles such as [[Maya art]] and [[Aztec art]]. [[Olmec]] art is mentioned below.

===Egypt===
{{main article|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|Egyptian papyrus]]

Due to the highly religious nature of ancient [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilization, many of the great works of ancient Egypt depict gods, goddesses, and [[Pharaohs]], who were also considered divine. Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by the idea of order. Clear and simple lines combined with simple shapes and flat areas of color helped to create a sense of order and balance in the art of ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian artists used vertical and horizontal reference lines  to maintain the correct proportions in their work. Political and religious, as well as artistic, order was also maintained in Egyptian art. To clearly define the social hierarchy of a situation, figures were drawn to sizes that were based not on their distance from the painter's perspective but on relative importance. For instance, the Pharaoh would be drawn as the largest figure in a painting no matter where he was situated, and a greater God would be drawn larger than a lesser god.

Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the Pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, was omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Color, as well, had extended meaning—blue and green represented the Nile and life; yellow stood for the sun god; and red represented power and vitality. The colors in Egyptian artifacts have survived extremely well over the centuries because of Egypt's dry climate.

Despite the stilted form caused by a lack of perspective, ancient Egyptian art is often highly realistic. Ancient Egyptian artists often show a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and a close attention to detail, especially in their renderings of animals.
During the 18th Dynasty of Egypt a Pharaoh by the name of [[Akhenaton]] took the throne and abolished the traditional [[polytheism]]. He formed a monotheistic religion based on the worship of Aten, a sun god. Artistic change followed political upheaval. A new style of art was introduced that was more naturalistic than the stylized frieze favored in Egyptian art for the previous 1700 years. After Akhenaton's death, however, Egyptian artists reverted to their old styles.

[[Faience]] that was produced in [[History of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] antiquity as early as 3500 BC was in fact superior to the tin-glazed [[earthenware]] of the European 15th century.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n3_v154/ai_21146424|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020082209/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n3_v154/ai_21146424|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-20|title=Ancient Egyptian faience|last=Friedman|first=Florence Dunn|date=September 1998|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[faience]] was not made of [[clay]] but instead actually of a [[ceramic]] composed primarily of [[quartz]].

===Mesopotamia===
{{main article|Art of Mesopotamia}}
[[Mesopotamia]] (from the Greek Μεσοποταμία "[land] between the rivers", in Syriac called ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ pronounced "Beth Nahrain", "Land of rivers", rendered in Arabic as بلاد الرافدين bilād al-rāfidayn) is a toponym for the area of the [[Tigris]]-[[Euphrates]] river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, as well as some parts of northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and southwestern Iran. Mesopotamia is often considered the "cradle of civilization." Within its boundaries, some of the most ancient civilizations known first developed [[writing]] and [[agriculture]]. Many civilizations flourished there, leaving behind a rich legacy of ancient art.

Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. In the Iron Age, it was ruled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires. The indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians &amp; Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC and after his death it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.

Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthians. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with parts of Mesopotamia (particularly Assyria) coming under periodic Roman control. In 226 AD, it fell to the Sassanid Persians, and remained under Persian rule until the 7th-century Arab Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire. A number of primarily Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Oshroene and Hatra. 
Etymology:
The regional toponym Mesopotamia (from the root words "meso" &lt; μέσος = middle and "potamia" &lt; ποταμός = river, literally "between rivers") was coined in the Hellenistic period to refer to a broad geographical area without definite boundaries, and was probably used by the Seleucids. The term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept and was coined during the Aramaicization of the region, in the 10th century BC.

It is widely accepted, however, that early Mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire alluvium by the Sumerian term kalam ("land"). More recently, terms like "Greater Mesopotamia" or "Syro-Mesopotamia" have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the Near East or Middle East. These later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.

===Sumerian===
[[File:Ur chariot.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[chariot]] and rider from the ''[[Standard of Ur]]'', c. 2500 BC]]
Archaeological evidence attests to their existence during the [[5th millennium BC]]. The Sumerians decorated their [[pottery]] with [[cedar oil]] [[paint]]s. The Sumerians also developed [[jewelry]].

One of the most remarkable artifacts remaining from the Sumerian civilization is known as the ''[[Standard of Ur]]''. Dated to approximately 2500 B.C., the Standard is a wooden box inlaid with shells and [[lapis lazuli]]. It depicts, on one side, [[soldiers]] presenting their [[monarch|king]] with prisoners and, on the other side, [[peasant]]s presenting him with gifts—stunning evidence that attests to the vibrancy of art in this [[ancient]] [[culture]]. Sumer had made many great advances; for example, there is the wheel, which had made transportation easier for the Sumerians. The arch was the greatest architectural achievement of Sumer. The ziggurats were pyramid-shaped temples the Sumerian architects built. They believed that the gods lived at the tops of the temples. The kings would declare that the gods had sent them to rule, and the Sumerians would happily follow the king's laws. The king had many important jobs like leading the army and looking after irrigation, with which Sumerians could control rivers.  The rulers would have battles over land, and life went on for the Sumerians.

===Babylon===
The conquest of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] by [[Babylon]] marks a turning point in the artistic as well as political history of the region.

The Babylonians took advantage of the abundance of [[clay]] in [[Mesopotamia]] to create [[brick]]s. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and [[column]], as well as of [[fresco]]es and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with [[bronze]] or [[gold]] as well as with tiles. Painted [[terra-cotta]] cones were also embedded in the plaster.

The sean were also great [[metal]]-workers, creating functional and beautiful tools with [[copper]]. It is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working, which spread westward with the civilization to which it belonged. In addition, the want of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of [[engraved gem|gem]]-cutting. The arts of Babylon also included [[tapestries]], and Babylonian civilization was from an early date famous for its embroideries and rugs.

===Assyria===
{{main article|Art and architecture of Assyria}}
[[File:Human-headed winged bull Khorsabad profile - Louvre 02b.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Assyria]]n statue]]
Like all other [[monarchy|kingdom]]s, the Babylonian kingdom did not last forever. When Babylon fell into decline it was eventually conquered by [[Assyria]], one of its former colonies, Assyria inherited its arts as well as its empire.

At first, Assyrian [[architect]]s and artists copied Babylonian styles and materials, but as time went by, however, the later Assyrians began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influences. The walls of the Assyrian palaces were lined with slabs of stone instead of brick, and were colored instead of painted as in [[Chaldea]]. In place of the [[bas relief]] we have [[sculpture|sculpted figures]], the earliest examples being the statues from [[Girsu]] which are realistic but somewhat clumsy.

No remarkable specimens of metallurgic art from early Assyria have been found, but at a later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such [[jewellery]] as ear-rings and bracelets of [[gold]]. [[Copper]] was also worked with skill.

The forms of Assyrian pottery were graceful; the [[porcelain]], like the [[glass]] discovered in the palaces of [[Nineveh]], was derived from [[Egypt]]ian originals. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of [[Sargon II]]. Stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the manufacture of vases. Vases of hard stone have been disinterred at Tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

Ashurbanipal had promoted art and culture and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at Nineveh.

===The Minoan Civilization===
{{Main article|Minoan pottery}}
The greatest civilization of the [[Bronze Age]] was that of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]], a mercantilist people who built a trading empire from their homeland of [[Crete]] and from other Aegean islands. Minoan civilization was known for its beautiful [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], but also for its [[fresco]]s, [[landscape]]s, and stone carvings. In the early Minoan period, ceramics were characterized by spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, and fishbone motifs. In the middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs such as fish, squid, birds, and lilies were common. In the late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still the most characteristic, but variability had increased. The 'palace style' of the region around [[Knossos]] is characterized by strong geometric simplification of naturalistic shapes and by [[monochromatic]] painting. The Palace at Knossos was decorated with frescoes that showed aspects of daily life, including court ritual and entertainment such as bull-leaping and [[boxing]]. The [[Minoans]] were also skilled [[gold]]smiths who created beautiful pendants and masks.

===The Mycenaean Civilization===
[[Mycenae]]an art is close to the Minoan and includes many splendid finds from the royal graves, most famously the [[Mask of Agamemnon]], a gold funeral mask. As may be seen from this item, the Mycenaeans specialized in gold-working. Their artworks are known for a plethora of decorative motifs employed. At some point in their cultural history, the Mycenaeans adopted the Minoan goddesses and associated these goddesses with their sky-god; scholars believe that the Greek pantheon of deities does not reflect Mycenaean religion except for the goddesses and Zeus. These goddesses, however, are Minoan in origin.

===Greek art===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek art}}

[[File:Thebeskouros.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kouros]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], Thebes Archaeological Museum]]
Ancient Greek art includes much pottery, sculpture as well as architecture. Greek sculpture is known for the [[contrapposto]] standing of the figures. The art of Ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods: the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The history of Ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods: the Protogeometric, the Geometric, the Late Geometric or Archaic, the Black Figure and the Red Figure. Ancient Greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture, as well as in such minor arts as coin design, pottery and gem engraving.

The most prestigious form of Ancient Greek painting was [[panel painting]], now known only from literary descriptions; they perished rapidly after the 4th century AD, when they were no longer actively protected. Today not much survives of Greek painting, except for late [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy paintings]] and a few paintings on the walls of tombs, mostly in Macedonia and Italy. Painting on pottery, of which a great deal survives, gives some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting. The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. It was mainly in black and [[gold]] and was painted using different paints than the ones used on walls or wood, because it was a different surface.

The first sculptures in [[India]] date back to the [[Indus Valley civilization]] some 5,000 years ago, where small stone carvings and bronze castings have been discovered. Later, as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unrivaled temple carvings, some in huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]].

The [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Maharashtra]], India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the second century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242|title=Ajanta Caves|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=2008-12-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218043116/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia (Iran)===
{{main article|Persian art}}
[[File:Takht-jamshid.jpg|thumb|left|300px|After 2500 years, the ruins of Persepolis still inspire visitors from far and near.]]
[[Iran]] succeeded to the [[Hittite Empire]] and initially took much of its artistic styles from them. Huge palaces in rural settings, often worked on by craftsmen drawn from other nations, subject or not, were distinctive features. After the Empire was decisively overthrown by [[Alexander the Great]] a new [[Sassanian]] culture emerged, notable for palaces and metalwork. The capitals [[Susa]], [[Persepolis]], Ecbatana and Estakhr have revealed much rich Persian art.

===Rome===
{{main article|Roman art}}
{{further|Pompeian Styles|Roman Wall Painting (200 BC-79 AD)}}
It is commonly said that Roman art was derivative from Greek and [[Etruscan art]]. Indeed, the villas of the wealthy Romans unearthed in [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] show a strong predilection for all things Greek. Many of the most significant Greek artworks survive by virtue of their Roman interpretation and imitation. Roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people, and express ideas of beauty and nobility. Their busts, and especially the images of individuals on gravestones, are very expressive and lifelike, finished with skill and panache.

In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or [[encaustic painting]] on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from circa 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate the similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well. [[Pliny the Younger]] complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out…Indolence has destroyed the arts."

==East Asia==

===Japan===
{{further information|Japanese art}}
The eras of Japanese art correspond to the locations of various governments. The earliest known Japanese artifacts are attributable to the Aniu tribe, who influenced the Jōmon people, and these eras came to be known as the [[Jōmon]] and [[Yayoi]] time periods. Before the Yayoi invaded Japan, Jimmu in 660 B.C. was the crowned emperor. Later came the Haniwa of the Kofun era, then the Asuka when Buddhism reached Japan from China. The religion influenced Japanese art significantly for centuries thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.art.com/wiki/japanese-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main article|Chinese art}}

Prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in [[Neolithic]] China can be traced back to the [[Yangshao culture]] and [[Longshan culture]] of the Yellow River valley. During China's [[Bronze Age]], Chinese of the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] produced multitudes of artistic bronzeware vessels for practical purposes, but also for religious ritual and [[geomancy]]. The earliest (surviving) Chinese paintings date to the [[Warring States]] period, and they were on [[silk]] as well as [[lacquerware]]s.

[[File:Soldier Horse.JPG|thumb|A [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] Chinese [[Terracotta Army|terracotta soldier]] and his horse, 3rd century BC]]
One of ancient China's most famous artistic relics remains the [[Terracotta warriors]], an assembly of 8,099 individual and life-size terracotta figures (such as infantry, horses with chariots and cavalry, archers, and military officers), buried in the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the First Qin Emperor, in 210 BC. This tradition was carried into the subsequent [[Han Dynasty]], although their tombs contained miniature versions of the soldiers in addition to domestic servants to serve rulers and nobility in the afterlife. Chinese art arguably shows more continuity between ancient and modern periods than that of any other civilization, as even when foreign dynasties took the Imperial throne they did not impose new cultural or religious habits and were relatively quickly assimilated.

==Central America (Mexico)==
[[File:CabezaColosal1 MuseoXalapa.jpg|thumb|An [[Olmec]] stone head]]

===Olmec art===
The ancient [[Olmec]] "Bird Vessel" and bowl, both [[pottery|ceramic]] and dating to circa 1000 BC as well as other [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] are produced in [[kiln]]s capable of exceeding approximately 900&amp;nbsp;°C. The only other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small [[jade]] carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine [[jaguar]]. [[Olmec figurine]]s were also found abundantly through their period.

An '''audition''' is a sample performance by an [[actor]], [[singer]], [[musician]], [[dancer]] or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a [[monologue]]. Singers will perform a [[song]] in a popular music context or an [[aria]] in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece.

The audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a [[job interview]] in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability).

Auditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for [[permanent employment]] with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs ([[B.Mus]], [[M.Mus]], [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent.

==Actors==
[[File:Владимир Назаров.jpg|thumb|For actors, monologues and speeches are the "calling card" that they use to demonstrate their skills to casting directors.]]

For actors in theater, film, and TV, the "audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions.  Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditionmonologues.com/Audition%20Tips.html|title=Audition Tips Monologues Actors Kids Teens Women Men|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In film and television, the audition is called a [[screen test]], and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10–20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's "type", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production.

Actors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716210917/http://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering "whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"/&gt;

Audition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in ''[[Hamlet]]'' may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for ''Hamlet'' would have a dramatic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an [[Oscar Wilde]] [[comedy]], or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).

For most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8"x10" photo called a "head shot" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may "call back" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee.

Right before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be "thrown off balance" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more.

Film auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given "sides" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1–3 days before the audition.

In 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country.

==Music==

===Popular music===

====Instrumentalists====
[[File:Wolfgang Schmid Unterfahrt-OhWeh-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play basslines from a range of different styles.]]
In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as "Now's the Time") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a [[rhythm section]] role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or "feels" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow [[ballad]], a medium "standard", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a [[Motown]] style [[bassline]], a syncopated 1970s [[funk]] "slapping" style line, and a [[reggae]]-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer.

A performer auditioning for a solo or "lead" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to [[improvise]] a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on "stage presence" and movement onstage, such as classic [[jazz]] or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal "[[shred guitar]]" or [[hardcore punk]], it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement).

====Singers====
[[File:Irving Berlin Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irving Berlin]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], and [[Helen Tamiris]] watching music theater auditions]]
For rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a [[musical theatre]] production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing [[opera]] or [[country music]], and a musician auditioning for a seat in an [[orchestra]] would not perform [[rock (music)|rock]].  Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the [[music genre|genre]] to which the musical pertains.  For instance, a singer auditioning for ''[[Destry Rides Again (musical)|Destry Rides Again]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[country-western]] song. A person auditioning for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[rock music|rock]] song.  As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and related styles such as [[blues rock]]. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening.

[[File:ESC 2007 Denmark - DQ - Drama Queen.jpg|thumb|A contestant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] tries to impress the judges at her live audition]]
For smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without [[talent agent|agents]], show up. These are popularly known as "cattle calls", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' depicts this type of audition. ''[[American Idol]]'' also auditions its aspiring [[vocalists]] using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a [[backup singer]] may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple [[rhythm guitar]] part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as [[Bossa Nova]] (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and [[Celtic music]] (Irish songs may be requested).

===Classical music===
In classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards.

====Instrumentalists====

In classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and "tutti" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. Since the post-WW II era, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. In many major orchestras, a cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism.

An orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant).

This first "cut" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music.

If a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

====Singers====
There is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances,&lt;ref&gt;The exception is [[acoustic enhancement]] systems which apply a subtle amplification in order to balance the volume in the hall and compensate for acoustic problems.&lt;/ref&gt; the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin.

==Musical theatre==
In [[musical theatre]], a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of [[song]]s, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute [[monologue]]. A headshot and résumé are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered “the norm” in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. "Callbacks", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer’s skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best.

==Dance==
[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two dancers performing [[modern dance]], a style in which performers may be asked to demonstrate improvised movements at an audition.]]
There are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves.
[[File:Brazier Dancers 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|These dancers from the Braziers troupe are performing [[Highland dancing]], a style at which auditionees must demonstrate a high degree of technique and the ability to quickly learn new steps.]]
Many dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new [[choreography]] in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated.

Dancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a "headshot" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and [[pointe shoes]], and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their [[tap dancing]] skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup.

In music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a [[backup singer]] (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer-actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''. In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role).

Some major dance companies have "open calls" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time.

==Circuses and amusement parks==
[[File:Acrobat.jpg|thumb|A [[high wire]] act by an acrobat]]

Performers auditioning for amusement parks world wide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks &amp; Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/auditions/experience/prepare.html|title=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Cirque du Soleil]], depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's  discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed.

==Modeling==

[[File:Ai Tominaga, Red Dress Collection 2004.jpg|thumb|Model [[Ai Tominaga]] modeling in the 2004 [[The Heart Truth|Red Dress Collection for the Heart Truth]] campaign]]

[[Fashion model|Modelling]] agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are "niche markets" for non-svelte models ("plus size models" and "real life models" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108–125&amp;nbsp;lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18–25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera.

For high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the "catwalk" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model. Some modelling agencies audition a large number of aspiring models in an "open call", in which agents consider applicants for under a minute or so each. Some agencies hold model searches, which is a type of beauty contest in which applicants audition for the opportunity of winning a model portfolio or a photo shoot.

[[File:Östermalm, Stockholm, Sweden - panoramio (66).jpg|thumb|upright|''Flygarmonumentet'']]

The '''Aviator Monument''' ({{lang-sv|'Flygarmonumentet'}}) is a [[statue]] that stands at [[Karlaplan]] in central [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The statue was a gift from the [[Royal Swedish Aero Club|Swedish Aeronautical Society]] in memory of different Swedish aviation pioneers who fell in both the North Pole expedition and in the first time of the Swedish aviator era in 1917. The task to build the [[monument]] was given to the famous sculptor [[Carl Milles]]. The Aviator Monument was finished in 1931.

==The statue==
The monument is a sculpture of a large [[eagle]] with outstretched wings about to lift. Height 185&amp;nbsp;cm, width 750&amp;nbsp;cm and depth 185&amp;nbsp;cm. On the plinth which the statue is standing on are reliefs of [[Icarus]], balloonists and early warplanes. Milles thought that an eagle would be an excellent [[symbol]]. Inside the shallow monument there is an urn, which contains medals for each fallen Swedish pilot.

==History==
Some may think that the Aviator Monument is Carl Milles admiration for Nazism. The [[eagle]] with its outstretched wings is often associated with the [[Nazi]] symbol, The Nazi Eagle. In the 1940s, young Swedish Nazis used the monument as a meeting point, and a place for gathering and commemoration. At this meeting point they commemorated. During this time young socialists sabotaged the statue with [[graffiti]] in protests against Nazis. The Swedish Air Force used it as a monument for a wreath-laying ceremony. The original purpose of this statue is to honour fallen pilots such as [[Salomon August Andrée]], Nils Strindberg and Knut Fraenkel who died in the North Pole expedition in 1898. The monument was taken down during the construction of the [[Karlaplan metro station]] and re-erected again in 1967.

The '''Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo''' is a [[basilica]] church in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]. It was erected by [[Ostrogoth]] King [[Theodoric the Great]] as his palace chapel during the first quarter of the 6th century (as attested to in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]''). This [[Arian]] church was originally dedicated in 504 AD to "Christ the Redeemer".&lt;ref&gt;A study of the mosaics in the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in [[Ravenna, Italy]]. [http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/html/ruskin_searchresults.asp?Type=adv&amp;SearchOn=makerassets&amp;ID=744&amp;CurrObj=4&amp;mode=1]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010"&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reconsecrated in 561 AD, under the rule of the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]], under the new name "Sanctus Martinus in Coelo Aureo" ("Saint Martin in Golden Heaven"). Suppressing the Arian cult, the church was dedicated to [[Saint Martin of Tours]], a foe of Arianism. According to legend, [[Pope Gregory the Great]] ordered that the [[mosaics]] in the church be blackened, as their golden glory distracted worshipers from their prayers. The basilica was renamed again in 856 AD when relics of [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] were transferred from the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] because of the threat posed by frequent raids of pirates from the [[Adriatic Sea]].

Its [[apse]] and [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] underwent modernization at various times, beginning in the 6th century with the destruction of mosaics whose themes were too overtly Arian or which expressed the king's glory, but the mosaics of the lateral walls, twenty-four columns with simplified [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s, and an [[Ambon (liturgy)|Ambo]] are preserved. On some columns, images of arms and hands can be seen, which are parts of figures once representing praying Goths and Theodoric's court, deleted in Byzantine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Medioevo|pages=40–43|year=2009|issue=149|title=... e scomparvero nella nebbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations (and alterations) were done to the mosaics in the mid-19th century by Felice Kibel. The present apse is a reconstruction after being damaged during [[World War I]].

==Architecture and decoration==
[[File:Ravenna Basilica of Sant'Apollinare inside.jpg|thumb|left|View towards the Apses]]

On the upper band of the left lateral wall are 13 small mosaics, depicting Jesus' miracles and parables; and on the right wall are 13 mosaics depicting the Passion and Resurrection. However, the flagellation and crucifixion are lacking. They describe the parts of the Bible that were read aloud in the church during Lent under the rule of [[Theodoric the Great]]. On the left, Jesus is always depicted as young, beardless man, dressed as a Roman Emperor. On the right, Jesus is depicted with a beard. For the Arians, this emphasized that Jesus grew older and became a "man of sorrows", as spoken of by the prophet Isaiah. These mosaics are separated by decorative mosaic panels depicting a shell-shaped niche with a tapestry, cross, and two doves. These mosaics were executed by at least two artists. 

[[File:Ravenna_Basilica_of_Sant%27Apollinare_Nuovo_mosaic_(2).jpg|thumb|Mosaic on the right side wall of the nave: palace of Theodoric. Remains of hands are still visible in the columns.]]
The next row of mosaics are a scheme of haloed saints, prophets and evangelists, sixteen on each side. The figures are executed in a Hellenistic-Roman tradition and show a certain individuality of expression as compared to the other figures in the basilica. Each individual depicted holds a book, in either scroll or codex format, and, like many of the other figures throughout the basilica, each of their robes has a mark or symbol in it. These mosaics alternate with windows. They were executed in the time of Theodoric.

The row below contains large mosaics in Byzantine style, lacking any individuality, having all identical expressions. These were executed about 50 years after the time of bishop [[Agnellus, Bishop of Ravenna|Agnellus]], when the church had already become an Orthodox church. To the left is a procession of the 22 Virgins of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, led by the [[Three Magi]], moving from the city of Classe towards the group of the Madonna and Child surrounded by four angels. (The Magi in this mosaic are named Balthasar, Melchior and Gaspar; this is thought to be the earliest example of these three names being assigned to the Magi in Christian art.) To the right is a similar procession of 26 Martyrs, led by Saint Martin and including Saint Apollinaris, moving from the Palace of Theodoric towards a group representing Christ enthroned amid four angels. This lower band, containing a schematic representation of the [[Palace of Theoderic]] on the right wall and the port of Classe with three ships on the left wall, gives us a certain idea of the architecture in Ravenna [[Ostrogothic Ravenna|during the time of Theodoric]]. In another part of the church there is a rough mosaic containing the portrait of the [[Emperor Justinian]].

|alt=Panorama of the North nave wall mosaics at Sant Apollinare Nuovo|dir=rtl}}

The entrance of the church is preceded by a marble [[portico]] built in the 16th century. Next to the church, on the right side of the portico, stands a round bell tower dating from the 9th or 10th century.

When the [[UNESCO]] inscribed the church on the [[World Heritage List]], its experts pointed out that "both the exterior and interior of the basilica graphically illustrate the fusion between the western and eastern styles characteristic of the late 5th to early 6th century. This is one of the most important buildings from the period of crucial cultural significance in European religious art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/788.pdf UNESCO World Heritage List - Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna: Advisory Body Evaluation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some art historians claim that one of the mosaics contains the first depiction of [[Satan]] in western art. In the mosaic, a blue angel appears to the left hand side of Jesus behind three goats (mentioned in St Matthew's account of Judgement Day).&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01nmt3q/ How the Devil Got His Horns: A Diabolical Tale] (BBC)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:george-baker-bridget-doyly-carte.jpg|right|thumb|300px|With [[George Baker (baritone)|George Baker]] at a Gilbert and Sullivan Society celebration in 1964]]

'''Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte''', [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (25 March 1908 – 2 May 1985), was the granddaughter of impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and the only daughter of [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].  She was head of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1948 until 1982.

Though as a child she was not enthusiastic about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], after her father's death in 1948, Bridget D'Oyly Carte inherited the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and controlled the copyrights to the joint works of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], as well as all of her family's business interests.  She had begun to assist her father in managing the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1933, also undertaking child welfare work.  

She hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager of the opera company in 1951 and moved to keep the [[Savoy opera]]s fresh, marketing them as a bridge between popular and classical music.  After the copyrights to the Gilbert and Sullivan works expired in 1961, she transferred the opera company to a charitable trust that she headed.  Mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982, although the company re-formed after Carte's death and mounted several productions up to 2003.

In 1972, Carte founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust to support charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment.  She was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in 1975.  With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line.

==Life and career==
Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte was born at Suffolk Street, [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London, and educated in England and abroad. Her father was [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], and her mother was the former Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;Obituary notice, ''[[The Times]]'', 3 May 1985, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather was [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], who founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Oyly "was a forename (not part of a double surname)". Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}. The name comes from her grandfather's great grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Savoy Hotel, London.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
In 1926, when she was only 18, she married her first cousin, John David Gathorne-Hardy, the fourth [[Earl of Cranbrook]] (1900–1978),&lt;ref&gt;Both were grandchildren of [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;/ref&gt; an explorer and naturalist. As a result of her marriage, Carte was styled as Countess of Cranbrook, and her married name was Gathorne-Hardy.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, Darryl, ed. [http://thepeerage.com/p3563.htm#i35621 "Bridget Cicely Carte"], ThePeerage.com, 28 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They soon separated and finally divorced in 1931; she relinquished her title and resumed her maiden name by [[deed poll]] in 1932, also dropping the name Cicely, which she disliked.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U163678 "D'Oyly Carte, Dame Bridget"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition @ ukwhoswho.com, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 30 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then resumed her education at [[Dartington Hall]] in Devon from 1931 to 1933, a school with a long musical tradition, taking courses in dance, teacher training, art and design.  There she met designer [[Peter Goffin]] who became a long-time friend.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Taylor, C. M. P. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31046 "Carte, Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly (1908–1985)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2004), Oxford University Press, accessed 20 June 2009. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accidental death of her only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests.  As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy.  She later told ''The Gramophone'' magazine:  "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to ''hum'' Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I was a bit of a snake-in-the-grass because of it."&lt;ref&gt;"Wimbush, Roger. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/March%201975/33/838552 "Here and There"], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', March 1975, pp. 1630–33 (p. 33 in online version), accessed 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 to 1939, Carte was an assistant to her father at the [[Savoy Hotel]], taking responsibility for furnishing and interior decoration, for which she had training and aptitude.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Upon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], however, she undertook child welfare work and continued with it until her father's death in 1948.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The family home was [[Coleton Fishacre]], a house that her parents had built in [[Devon]] between [[Paignton]] and [[Kingswear]] in 1925.  The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', 25 October 2007, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  

After her parents' divorce in 1941, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  Shortly after her father's death, she sold Coleton Fishacre, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden "Coleton Fishacre"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden# |date=17 December 2009 }}, National Trust, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 she bought [[Shrubs Wood]], Chalfont St Giles, [[Buckinghamshire]], designed by the architects [[Erich Mendelsohn]] and [[Serge Chermayeff]].  Here she pursued her love of gardening and gave summer parties for disadvantaged or disabled children.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1953, Carte was a member of the committee overseeing the decorations for the Coronation Ball at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 November 1952, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing the family interests===
When her father died in 1948, she inherited all his interests including the Savoy Hotel group and [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|the family's opera company]], which presented the [[Savoy Operas]] from 1875 to 1982. She did not succeed Rupert D'Oyly Carte as chairman of the Savoy Hotel group, in which she retained a large shareholding, but she became an active director. She moved into a suite in the Savoy Hotel and resumed control of the furnishing and decoration departments. When the Savoy Group acquired them, she took interest in the soft-furnishing company, James Edwards, and was chairman of the royal florists, Edward Goodyear Ltd.  She became vice-chairman of the Group in 1971 and was its president at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

At first, Bridget D'Oyly Carte "did not feel qualified to sustain the responsibility" of running the opera company.&lt;ref name=Mander&gt;Mander and Mitchenson, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she was determined to prove herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Frederic. "The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – How it Works" in ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal'', 8/14, May 1964, pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; One of her early decisions proved especially unpopular and led to a wave of important defections from the company at the end of the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951, most importantly, [[Martyn Green]].  This was the 1949 hiring, as stage director, of [[Eleanor Evans]], Mrs. [[Darrell Fancourt]], known as "Snookie" in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Green wrote in 1952: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ... told Miss Carte that I thought she was making a great psychological error.  During [[Anna Bethell]]'s regime (Mrs. [[Sydney Granville]]), there had been growing signs of discontent and suggestions of favouritism.... But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude.  I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism.  My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right....  Production is done to a plan that takes no consideration of the individual, his personality or his histrionic ability – a stereotyped plan that results in a clockwork performance devoid of spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. 236–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian Tony Joseph wrote: "But Green was not the only member of the Company to leave....  [[Ella Halman]] left too.  So did [[Richard Watson (singer)|Richard Watson]] ... Margaret Mitchell ... [[Radley Flynn]] and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers.  It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked....  August 1951 was the end of an era.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place....  We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;  Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [fifteen years]. ...  I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement.  But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Walker (singer)|Richard Walker]], [[Kenneth Sandford]] and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods.  She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/E/EvansEleanor.htm "Eleanor Evans",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 24 June 2002; accessed 26 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, John. [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/k-sandford-fav.html "The Ones that I Like"], Interview with Sandford, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, reproduced from ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XI, No. 2, September 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carte made an important move to hire [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager in 1951, which position he continued to discharge until the company closed.  In running the D'Oyly Carte Opera company she took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery.  Her old friend, Peter Goffin, who had previously redesigned ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]'' for Rupert D'Oyly Carte, designed a unit set in 1957 to facilitate and reduce the cost of touring.  He also produced new settings and costumes for ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – settings only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  ''[[Princess Ida]]'' was redesigned by James Wade in 1954.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;

Carte claimed that the most important function of the operas, which in later years she advertised rather as musicals, was "to bridge the generation gap and link serious music to pop."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 1 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt; She televised and had recordings and films made of some of the operas, engaged [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]] to conduct performances at the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951 at the operas' original London home, the [[Savoy Theatre]], and supported an increasing number of tours of the United States.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1960 the company's own touring orchestra was formed as a change from the ad hoc recruitment of players at each venue.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1975 the company produced a centenary season at the Savoy Theatre, in 1977 it gave a royal [[Royal Command Performance]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and in 1979, for the first time, it toured Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961, Carte set up the charitable D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust to continue to present the operas.  She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts, recording rights and other assets, together with a cash endowment of £30,000.  She formed Bridget D'Oyly Carte Ltd to manage the opera company, with herself as chairman and managing director.  Finally, mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Even after it closed, however, the company's productions and style continued to influence the productions of other companies.&lt;ref name=bradley/&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in front of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of Carte and her family]]
In 1972, she founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust – entirely separate from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – supporting charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment. In 2001, the trust endowed the D'Oyly Carte Chair in Medicine and the Arts at [[King's College London]] with £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=129&amp;year=2001 "First UK Chair in Medicine and the Arts"], King's College, London, 29 March 2001, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 she was elected an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Society of Musicians]] of Great Britain, and in 1975 was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]].  

In the 1970s, Carte became the tenant of the semi-ruined [[Barscobe Castle]], [[Balmaclellan]], a small seventeenth-century fortified house in south-west Scotland, which she restored.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Always shy, old-fashioned and formal, Carte appreciated simplicity and avoided parties and social events as much as possible.  For her ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' entry she listed her recreations as, "country living and gardening; reading, theatre and music."&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
A heavy smoker, Carte died of lung cancer in her country home in Shrubs Wood, [[Buckinghamshire]] in 1985, aged 77. Her remains were cremated. She left a fortune of £5,479,888.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line. The Savoy hotel group continued under the control of her trustees until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+%27up+for+sale%27+as+Saudi+owner%27s+billions+dwindle/article.do "Savoy 'up for sale' as Saudi owner's billions dwindle"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419060158/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+'up+for+sale'+as+Saudi+owner's+billions+dwindle/article.do# |date=19 April 2009 }}, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's hotels remained among the most prestigious in London, with the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' calling the Savoy "London's most famous hotel" in 2009.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;  

A legacy of £1 million from her private fortune enabled a new opera company, using the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company name, to begin operations in 1988.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; The company secured sponsorship from Sir [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Michael Bishop]], who eventually became chairman of the Board of Trustees, and [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman).&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 53–69&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 2003 the new company produced short seasons each year, mounting productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, as well as operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Johann Strauss II]]. The new company did not employ many of the members of the original company and did not follow its performing traditions, even staging some "concept" productions of the operas. Once again, costs outran receipts, public subsidy was denied by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]], and the company suspended productions in May 2003. It continues to rent scores.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by the Carte family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.&lt;ref name=bradley&gt;Bradley, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html List of 200 amateur G&amp;S performing groups] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001125210/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html |date=1 October 2009 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bernard.

[[File:Dr. Seuss WikiWorld.png|thumb|300px|Example of a modern cartoon. The text was excerpted by cartoonist Greg Williams from the Wikipedia article on [[Dr. Seuss]]|alt=A cartoon shows a bearded man with a red bow tie holding numerous items. He holds the hat from Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" and balances a fishbowl on his left index finger.]]
A '''cartoon''' is a type of [[illustration]], possibly animated, typically in a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for [[satire]], [[caricature]], or [[humor]]; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a ''[[cartoonist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second sense they are usually called an ''[[animator]]''.

The concept originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, [[fresco]], [[tapestry]], or [[stained glass]] window. In the 19th century, beginning in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to [[Animated cartoon|animated]] films which resembled print cartoons.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art==
{{Main article|Modello}}
A cartoon (from {{Lang-it|cartone}} and {{Lang-nl|karton}}—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]], or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').{{sfn|Constable|1954|page=115}}

Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London, and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{sfn|Adelson|1994|page=330}}

==Print media==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] --&gt;
[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], ''Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow'', 1843, satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of "cartoon"|alt=A detailed black-and-white illustration is vignetted in the center showing people of various sizes looking at pictures framed on the left and back walls.]]

In print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|access-date=2007-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013522/http://www.punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|archive-date=2007-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly sketches by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=30}} The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Cartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.

Modern single-panel [[gag cartoon|''gag cartoons'']], found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a [[speech balloon]].{{sfn|Bishop|2009|p=92}} Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Michael |title=The Peter Arno Cartoons That Help Rescue The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-peter-arno-cartoons-that-helped-rescue-the-new-yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2018-09-16 |date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]], and [[Chon Day]].

[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]], and [[Virgil Partch]] began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated [[comic strips]]. [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]] is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.

''[[Editorial cartoons]]'' are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], and [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

''Comic strips'', also known as ''cartoon strips'' in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "[[Sunday comics|funnies]]". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as "[[cartoonist]]s". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

===Political cartoons===
{{main article|Editorial cartoon}}

Political cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}} [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton|publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of [[revolutionary France]] and [[Napoleon]].{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} [[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.

[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Nast depicts the [[Tweed Ring]]: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."|alt=A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]], in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=24}} His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the [[William M. Tweed|Tweed machine]] in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|pp=49–50}} Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.{{sfn|Morris|Tenniel|2005|p=344}}

Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when [[J. H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain|Miners' Federation]]. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific cartoons===
Cartoons such as ''[[xkcd]]'' have also found their place in the world of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[technology]]. Cartoons related to [[chemistry]] are, for example, the ''Wonderlab'', which looked at daily life in the lab.  In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]]. Not all, but many of [[Gary Larson]]'s cartoons have a scientific flavor.

===Comic books&lt;!--'Humor comics' and 'Humour comics' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Comic book}}
 
Books with cartoons are usually magazine-format "comic books," or occasionally [[Comics collection|reprints of newspaper cartoons]].

In Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.  Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]''  in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Keith Booker|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2014|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos|alt=a running horse (animated)]]
{{Main article|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, ''cartoon'' came to refer to [[animation]], and the word ''cartoon'' is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.{{sfn|Walasek|2009|p=116}}  While ''animation'' designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals,{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=41}} [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.

In the 1980s, ''cartoon'' was shortened to ''toon'', referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', followed in 1990 by the animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.

'''The Chelsea Arts Club''' is a private members club at '''143 Old Church Street''' in [[Chelsea, London]] with a membership of over 3,800, including artists, sculptors, architects, writers, designers, actors, musicians, photographers, and [[filmmaker]]s. The club was established on 21 March 1891 (in Chelsea), as a rival to the older [[The Arts Club|Arts Club]] in [[Mayfair, London|Mayfair]], on the instigation of the artist [[James McNeill Whistler|James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who had been a (sometimes controversial) member of the older club.

During its primary season from September–June the Chelsea Arts Club serves as a host for many functions, from instrumental and choral performances to visual arts exhibitions, literary talks, and weekend artist lunches.

Applicants for membership need to be sponsored by two current Members.

The club is located in the former '''Bolton Lodge''', a [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II listed]] building on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1225774|desc=Bolton Lodge|access-date=8 January 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Chelsea Arts Ball by William Gordon Burn Murdoch.jpg|thumb| 
''The Chelsea Art Ball'' by [[William Gordon Burn Murdoch]]]]
The Chelsea Arts Club was originally located in rooms at no. 181 [[King's Road]]. In 1902, the club moved to larger premises at no. 143 [[Old Church Street]]. In 1933 the club's premises, which had an acre of garden, were remodeled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://chelseaartsclub.com/home-public/history/
| title = History {{!}} Chelsea Arts Club
| website = chelseaartsclub.com
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clubhouse includes a snooker room, bedrooms, dining room, former 'ladies bar' turned private party room, and a garden.

From 1908 to 1958 the club held a series of public [[Fancy dress party|fancy dress balls]] at the [[Albert Hall]], latterly on [[New Year's Eve]], which raised funds for artists' charities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1958 balls were banned from the Albert Hall owing their notoriety for rowdiness, nudity and public homosexuality ([[Sexual Offences Act 1967|illegal before 1967]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, private functions were held at the club instead, with similarly lavish decorations and themes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966 the club was redecorated, a new bar was opened, and membership was opened to women artists.

[[File:Chelsea Arts Club - dazzle.jpg|thumb|The building painted with [[dazzle camouflage]]]]
Although normally a plain white building, the club exterior is occasionally painted to coincide with a themed event. It has been painted by set designer Tony Common. In 2010 it was painted bright colours with images of circus performers, and in 2011 was painted to appear as if it had been bombed in order to coincide with celebrations marking 70 years since the end of [[The Blitz]].

Color Factory has commonly been cited as part of a trend of “Instagram museums”, temporary art exhibitions catered towards younger [[Millennials|millennial]] audiences which are designed to be [[Photograph|photographed]] (especially in [[Selfie|selfies]]) and shared on [[Instagram]] and other [[social media]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2018/07/19/color_factory_coming_to_instagram.php|title=Introducing Color Factory, The Latest Instagrammable Pop-Up Coming To NYC|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719172436/http://gothamist.com/2018/07/19/color_factory_coming_to_instagram.php|archive-date=2018-07-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-color-factory-is-made-for-instagram-but-is-it-art|title=The Color Factory Is Made for Instagram, but Is It Art?|last=Winkelman|first=Natalia|date=2018-08-21|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/arts/color-factory-museum-of-ice-cream-rose-mansion-29rooms-candytopia.html|title=The Existential Void of the Pop-Up ‘Experience’|last=Hess|first=Amanda|date=2018-09-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/tech/instagram-pop-up-experiences-rose-mansion/index.html|title=Instagramable pop-ups can teach retailers a thing or two|last=Business|first=Story by Kaya Yurieff, CNN Business Video by Lisa Fischer, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vox|title=How "Instagram traps" are changing art museums|date=2018-09-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx_r-dP22Ps|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder Jordan Ferney has publicly pushed back against descriptions of Color Factory as an Instagram museum, stating that her goal “had always been to make something that was beautiful to experience, not photograph”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== History ==
Color Factory was founded in August 2017 by event-planner/blogger Jordan Ferney, artist Leah Rosenberg, and designer Erin Jang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It originally debuted as a one-month, 15-installation, 12,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibition in San Francisco, sponsored by [[Alaskan Airlines]] and Method Soap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its popularity (at one point causing its [[Eventbrite]] ticketing page to crash from high demand)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/7/31/16069956/color-factory-sf-tickets|title=Peek inside San Francisco’s newest Instagramable hotspot|work=Curbed SF|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this San Francisco run was later extended to last for a total of eight and a half months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In June and July 2018, Color Factory partnered with the [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] in New York City to exhibit the “[[Manhattan]] Color Walk”, an outdoor art installation which painted the ground with several stripes of colors, each sampled from a different street of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Art-Piece-Expresses-Colors-From-All-Across-Manhattan.html|title=Walk Displays Colors from 265 Blocks of NYC|work=NBC New York|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Color Factory reopened as a temporary 16-installation, 20,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standalone exhibition in New York City's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood, sponsored by [[Maybelline]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Crunchiness''' is the sensation of muffled grinding of a foodstuff.  Crunchiness differs from [[crispness]] in that a crisp item is quickly atomized, while a crunchy one offers sustained, [[granular]] resistance to [[jaw]] action.  While crispness is difficult to maintain, crunchiness is difficult to overcome.

Crunchy foods are associated with freshness.&lt;ref name=Roach /&gt;

==Relationship to sound==
Crispness and crunchiness can each be "assessed on the basis of [[sound]] alone, on the basis of oral-tactile clues alone, or on the basis of a combination of auditory and oral-tactile information".&lt;ref name=crunch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTR7VEJPDWAC&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=crunchiness&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iUlXba5eN4&amp;sig=r17PZ2f_wWPXBu_L2yigLsr9Z-M|title=Sensory Evaluation of Food: Principles and Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An acoustic [[frequency]] of 1.9&amp;nbsp;kHz seems to mark the threshold between the two sensations, with crunchiness at frequencies below, and crispness at frequencies above.

Crunchy food breaks at speeds faster than the [[speed of sound]].  The sound of crunching food is therefore "a tiny [[sonic boom]]".&lt;ref name=Roach&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/mary-roach-on-studying-food-and-how-humans-eat-it.html|title=Mary Roach on Studying How Humans Chew and Eat |last=Roach |first=Mary |date=26 March 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7744">'''Distinguishable interfaces''' use computer graphic principles to automatically
generate easily distinguishable appearance for computer data.

Although the [[desktop metaphor]] revolutionized user interfaces, there is evidence
that a spatial layout alone does little to help in locating files and other data;
distinguishable appearance is also required.
Studies have shown that average users have considerable difficulty finding files
on their personal computers, even ones that they created the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Search engines do not always help, since it has been found that users
often know of the existence of a file without being able to specify relevant search terms.
On the contrary, people appear to incrementally search for files using some form of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently researchers and web developers have argued that the problem is the
lack of distinguishable appearance:  in the traditional computer interface most objects
and locations appear identical.  This problem rarely occurs in the real world, where
both objects and locations generally have easily distinguishable appearance.
Discriminability was one of the recommendations in the 
ISO 9241-12 recommendation on presentation of information on visual displays
(part of the overall report on [[ISO_9241|Ergonomics of Human System Interaction]]),
however it was assumed in that report that this would be achieved by manual 
design of graphical symbols.

==VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons==
The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches
that make better use of the brain's "visual hardware", by providing
individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance.
This idea initially appeared in strictly academic 
VisualIDs&lt;ref name="visualids"&gt;

works, but the web community has explored and rapidly adopted similar ideas, such as the [[Identicon]].

The VisualIDs project&lt;ref name="visualids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | first = Michael
  | title = Cnet News: Navigating PCs with pictures, not words

automatically generated icons for files or other data based 
on a hash of the data identifier, so the icons had no relation to the content or meaning of the data.
It was argued not only that generating meaningful icons is unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | title = VisualIDs: FAQ
  | url = http://scribblethink.org/Work/VisualIDs/visualids_faq.html#meaningful
  | accessdate = 19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (their user study showed rapid learning of the arbitrary icons), 
but also that basing icons on ''content'' is actually ''incorrect''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | accessdate = 19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("contrasting visualization with visual identifiers"&lt;ref name="visualids" /&gt;).

The Semanticons project&lt;ref name="semanticons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Piquepaille
  | first = Roland 
  | title = ZDNET: Semanticons reveal the meaning of files

developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files.
In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve
related image(s) from an image database.  These are then processed using a [[Non-photorealistic rendering]] technique in order to generate graphical icons.

Developer Don Park introduced the [[identicon]] library for making a visual icon from a hash
of a data identifier.  This initial public implementation has spawned a large number
of implementations for various environments.  In particular, identicons are
now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems.  They are also used as a complement to [[Gravatar]]s, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.
(see [[#External links]]).

==Current research==
While current web practice has followed the semantics-free approach of VisualIDs,
recent research has followed the semantics-based approach of Semanticons.
Examples include using data mining principles to automatically create "intelligent icons"
that reflect the contents of files&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''National Emblem of [[Afghanistan]]''' has appeared in some form on the [[flag of Afghanistan]] since the beginning of the 20th century.

The latest incarnation of the emblem has the inscription of the [[shahadah]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the top. Below it is the image of a [[mosque]] with a [[mihrab]] and [[minbar]], or pulpit, within.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Afghanistan, Article 19 http://www.afghanembassy.com.pl/afg/images/pliki/TheConstitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to the mosque are two flags, taken to stand for flags of Afghanistan. Beneath the mosque is an inscription that states the name of the nation. Around the mosque are sheaves of wheat, and underneath that,  the [[Hijri year]] 1298 (1919 in the Gregorian calendar), the year Afghanistan gained independence from the [[British Empire|British]] influence.

'''''Et in Arcadia ego''''' (also known as '''''Les bergers d'Arcadie''''' or '''''The Arcadian Shepherds''''')&lt;ref&gt;Braider, Christopher, ''Refiguring the Real: Picture and Modernity in Word and Image, 1400–1700'', p. 292, 2015, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|1400872758}}, 9781400872756&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1637–38 painting by the leading painter of the classical [[17th-century French art|French Baroque]] style, [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594–1665). It depicts a [[pastoral]] scene with idealized [[shepherd]]s from [[classical antiquity]] clustering around an austere [[tomb]]. It is held in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].

Poussin painted two versions of the subject under the same title; his earlier version, painted in 1627, is held at [[Chatsworth House]]. An earlier treatment of the theme was painted by [[Guercino]] circa 1618–22, also titled ''[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Et in Arcadia ego]]''.

==Title==
The translation of the phrase is "Even in Arcadia, there am I". The usual interpretation is that "I" refers to [[Death (personification)|Death]], and "Arcadia" means a utopian land. It would thus be a ''[[memento mori]]''. During Antiquity, many Greeks lived in cities close to the sea, and led an urban life. Only [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]], in the middle of the [[Peloponnese]], lacked cities, were far from the sea, and led a shepherd life. Thus Arcadia symbolized pure, rural, idyllic life, far from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|Arcadia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Poussin's biographer, [[André Félibien]], interpreted the phrase to mean that "the person buried in this tomb lived in Arcadia"; in other words, that the person too once enjoyed the pleasures of life on earth. This reading was common in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, [[William Hazlitt]] wrote that Poussin "describes some shepherds wandering out in a morning of the spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription, 'I also was an Arcadian'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The round table: a collection of essays on literature, men, and manners, by William Hazlitt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HYPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=hazlitt+%22round+table%22+%22why+the+arts+are+not+progressive%22&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Why the arts are not progressive – A fragment|year=1817|page=258|publisher=Constable|location=Edinburgh and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former interpretation ("ego" referring to Death) is now generally considered more likely; the ambiguity of the phrase is the subject of a famous essay by the [[art historian]] [[Erwin Panofsky]] (see References). Either way, the sentiment was meant to set up an [[irony|ironic]] contrast between the shadow of death and the usual idle merriment that the [[nymph]]s and swains of ancient Arcadia were thought to embody.

==Inspiration==
[[Image:Et-in-Arcadia-ego.jpg|thumb|[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino's version]] of the subject.]]
The first appearance of a tomb with a memorial inscription (to [[Daphnis]]) amid the idyllic settings of Arcadia appears in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' V 42 ff. Virgil took the idealized Sicilian rustics that had first appeared in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] and set them in the primitive Greek district of Arcadia (see Eclogues VII and X). The idea was taken up anew in the circle of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in the 1460s and 1470s, during the [[Florentine Renaissance]].

In his pastoral work ''Arcadia'' (1504), [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of [[idyll]]ic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges. The first pictorial representation of the familiar ''memento mori'' theme that was popularized in 16th-century Venice, now made more concrete and vivid by the inscription &lt;small&gt;ET IN ARCADIA EGO&lt;/small&gt;, is [[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino]]'s version, painted between 1618 and 1622 (in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome), in which the inscription gains force from the prominent presence of a [[Skull (mythology)|skull]] in the foreground, beneath which the words are carved.

==1627 version==
[[Image:Poussin1627.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] 1627 version of the ''Arcadian Shepherds'', in [[Chatsworth House]], depicting a different tomb with the same inscription.]]
Poussin's own first version of the painting (now in [[Chatsworth House]]) was probably commissioned as a reworking of Guercino's version. It is in a far more [[Baroque]] style than the later version, characteristic of Poussin's early work. In the Chatsworth painting the shepherds are actively discovering the half-hidden and overgrown tomb, and are reading the inscription with curious expressions. The shepherdess, standing at the left, is posed in sexually suggestive fashion, very different from her austere counterpart in the later version. The later version has a far more geometric composition and the figures are much more contemplative. The mask-like face of the shepherdess conforms to the conventions of the Classical "Greek profile".

==Interpretation==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}
The most important difference between the two versions is that in the latter version, one of the two shepherds recognizes the shadow of his companion on the tomb and circumscribes the silhouette with his finger. According to an ancient tradition (see [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV 5, 15), this is the moment in which the art of painting is first discovered. Thus, the shepherd's shadow is the first image in art history. But the shadow on the tomb is also a symbol of death (in the first version symbolized by a skull on the top of the tomb). The meaning of this highly intricate composition seems to be that, from prehistory onward, the discovery of art has been the creative response of humankind to the shocking fact of mortality. Thus, death’s claim to rule even Arcadia is challenged by art (symbolized by the beautifully dressed maiden), who must insist that she was discovered in Arcadia too, and that she is the legitimate ruler everywhere, whilst death only usurps its power. In the face of death, art's duty—indeed, her ''raison d’être''—is to recall absent loved ones, console anxieties, evoke and reconcile conflicting emotions, surmount isolation, and facilitate the expression of the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Becht-Jördens, Gereon; Wehmeier, Peter M. (2003). Picasso und die christliche Ikonographie. Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin. pp. 181–209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpted versions==
[[Image:Shugborough arcadia.jpg|thumb|The Shugborough relief, adapted from an engraving of Poussin's second version.]]

The undated mid-eighteenth-century marble bas-relief is part of the Shepherds Monument, a garden feature at [[Shugborough House]], Staffordshire, England. Beneath it is the cryptic [[Shugborough inscription]], as yet undeciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/AcademyShepherdsMon-169 |title=The Shepherd's Monument |publisher=Shugborough |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversed composition suggests that it was copied from an [[engraving]], the compositions of which are commonly reversed because direct copies to the plate produce mirror images on printing.

In 1832 another relief was sculpted as part of the monument marking Poussin's tomb in Rome, on which it appears beneath a bust of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duepassinelmistero.com/_borders/POUSSIN_3.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the art historian Richard Verdi, it appears as if the shepherds are contemplating "their own author's death."&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, G. &amp; Scott, K., [http://assets.cambridge.org/052164/0040/sample/0521640040WSC00.pdf ''Commemorating Poussin: Reception and Interpretation of the Artist''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999. Cf. "Introduction: Commemorating Poussin" by Katie Scott, p. 9. "As Richard Verdi has noted, this change of context resulted in Poussin's shepherds being led to contemplate their own author's death, and invited the viewer to ponder the monument with the same solemnity and poignancy with which the shepherds brood on Death's incursion into Arcadia."
* Also cf. Verdi, Richard, "Poussin's giants: from romanticism to surrealism", in this collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Et in Arcadia ego'' is the title of section 295, Volume II, Part Two ("The Wanderer and his Shadow"),  of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (1880). The passage describes a pastoral evening scene in the high mountains, finishing with the lines: "Unconsciously, as if nothing could be more natural, you peopled this pure, clear world of light (which had no trace of yearning, of expectancy, of looking forward or backward) with Greek heroes. You felt it all as Poussin and his school felt it, at once heroic and idyllic. So individual men too have lived, constantly feeling themselves in the world and the world in themselves, and among them one of the greatest men, the inventor of a heroico-idyllic form of philosophy, Epicurus."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, [https://archive.org/stream/humanalltoohuman033142mbp/humanalltoohuman033142mbp_djvu.txt ''Human, All Too Human''], archive.org.

*In conjunction with John Andrew, the artist [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] created a marble carving entitled ''Et in Arcadia ego'' in 1976. The main part of the carving shows a military tank in a pastoral landscape, below which are carved the title and the words "After Nicholas Poussin". Several other works by Finlay directly or indirectly reference Poussin's artwork.&lt;ref name=Abrioux1985&gt;{{Citation|pages=205–207|title=Ian Hamilton Finlay: A Visual Primer|last1=Abrioux|first1=Yves|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1985|ISBN=0-948462-00-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The authors of the pseudohistory ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982), under the false impression that "et in arcadia ego" was not a proper Latin sentence, proposed that it is an [[anagram]] for ''I! Tego arcana dei'', which translates to "Begone! I keep God's secrets", suggesting that the tomb contains the remains of [[Jesus]] or another important [[Bible|Biblical]] figure. 
*Poussin's 'Et In Arcadia Ego' features prominently in the [[Jane Jensen]] video game [[Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned.]]  The paintings alleged mystical symbolism and occult imagery is used to help create a story based on the idea that the tomb of Christ is located in the south of France.

*[[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]] was the name of [[Duran Duran]]'s spin off band formed in 1985 by Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor, reportedly because of the inscription on this painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/0f4e6cc8-8a38-4741-b344-9d388def0060 |title=Music – Arcadia |publisher=BBC |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Et in Arcadia ego'' was the [[Arcadia (play)#Title|originally planned title]] of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1993 play, ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'', in which the phrase is used erroneously by one character (whose misuse is acknowledged by two other characters).  The phrase also reflects the themes of the play itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Tom. ''Stoppard's "Arcadia"'' (Modern Theatre Guides, London: Continuum). {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9621-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fourth movement from [[Thomas Adès]]' 1994 string quartet ''[[Arcadiana]]'' is called 'Et ... (tango mortale)'
*In ''[[Earthquake Weather (novel)|Earthquake Weather]]'' (1997) by [[Tim Powers]], the phrase, interpreted as an unfinished sentence meaning "Even in Arcadia, I...", plays a recurring role, tied into the book's themes of the [[Fisher King]] and [[Dionysus]] in his role as a [[psychopomp]].
*''Et in Arcadia Ego'' is the title of a closing chapter in [[Jesse Bullington]]'s historical fantasy novel ''[[The Enterprise of Death]]'' (2001).

{{nihongo|'''''Game Center Arashi'''''|ゲームセンターあらし|Geimu Sentā Arashi}} is a Japanese [[manga]] by [[Mitsuru Sugaya]], which ran in ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' from 1978 to 1984. It sold over 5 million copies {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and won the 1983 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[children's manga]].&lt;ref name="ShogakukanAward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 |publisher=Shogakukan |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094941/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was adapted as a popular [[anime]] television show that aired in 1982 in [[Japan]] on Mondays from 7:00pm to 7:30pm.; and in [[Hong Kong]].

In Japanese, the word "Arashi" means "storm". In [[Hong Kong]], the show aired under the title 電子神童, which translates to "Electronic Prodigy". The series was considered [[Cultural icon|iconic]] in [[Asia]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, since it came at a time when the public was being exposed to [[video games]] for the first time. The [[manga]] and TV series opened the imagination and possibilities of what gaming entertainment was about, while boosting its popularity as a new [[phenomenon]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Story==
The story is about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local [[Arcade game|arcades]]. He would meet competitors like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At a certain point in each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a [[top]] which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]] panels, turning the ordinary button into a [[turbo button]] thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being bucktoothed, and he always wears a hat labeled "Arashi" with a picture of a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprited]] alien.

''Game Center Arashi'' was the first animation with a [[gamer]] as the lead character and have the plot revolve around life with competitive gaming. Some of the games featured in the show include [[Space Invaders]], [[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]], [[Galaxian]], though they were not explicitly named. Some of Arashi's gaming techniques even have special names like "Blazed Top", "Vacuum Hurricane Shot", "Fish Stance".&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. [2006] (2006).

==Additional versions and appearances==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
In 1999, the series spawned a [[PlayStation]] [[novel]] called [[Game Center Arashi R]]. In 2004 [[Microsoft]] [[Tokyo]] used the character of Arashi as a mascot to boost [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] sales and image.

While the 2002 manga [[Arcade Gamer Fubuki]] reused the concept of a powerful gamer in the arcades, and also spawned a TV series of the same name, that show used entirely different characters and plots, modernizing while separating itself from the 1982 counterpart.

In 2006 the Let's TV Play Classic series of Plug and Plays used Arashi as a mascot.

'''Govert Dircksz Camphuysen''' (born at [[Dokkum]] in 1624, and died in Amsterdam in 1672) was an [[animal painter]], whose style was influenced by [[Paulus Potter]].

When his father [[Dirck Rafaelsz Camphuysen]] died in 1627, his mother moved with the children to Amsterdam. Camphuyzen lived in the [[Jordaan]]. In 1643 he painted portraits. He married in 1647 and left the city around 1650, not long after he became a [[poorter]]. By that time he was living in [[Kalverstraat]] and probably in financial trouble. He portrayed [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|queen Hedvig Eleonora]] in Stockholm, but Camphuyzen is most famous for his stables, with farmers and farmers' wives.

A painting in the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery|Dulwich Gallery]] of ''Peasants with cows before a cottage'', with a forged signature of Paulus Potter, is attributed to Camphuysen; in the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|Rotterdam Museum]] is a [[:File:Govert Camphuysen 001.jpg|picture of ''Peasants before an Inn'', signed G. Camphuijsen]]; the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Brussels Gallery]] has an 'Interior of a Farm,' signed with his name and dated 1650; and a painting of 'Peasants and Cattle before an Inn' in the [[Fridericianum|Cassel Gallery]] is also attributed to him. In the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[St. Petersburg]], are two Interiors of Cow-sheds, both bearing his signature.

Govaert Camphuysen's works are scarce; probably some of them are known as paintings by Paulus Potter; and others are attributed to his father, [[Dirk Rafaelsz Camphuysen|Dirk Raphaelsz]]. He was buried on 4 July 1672 from his house on [[Lastage]].

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ColeGealt1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bruce Cole|author2=Adelheid M.

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==
{{Main|Prehistoric art|Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Art of the Middle Paleolithic|List of Stone Age art}}

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

The history of Eastern painting includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

In [[Japonisme]], late 19th-century [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] like [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[tonalism|tonalists]] such as [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], admired early 19th-century Japanese [[Ukiyo-e]] artists like [[Hokusai]] (1760–1849) and [[Hiroshige]] (1797–1858) and were influenced by them.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

[[Image:Zhang Shengwen. L'enseignement de Bouddha Sakyamuni.jpg|thumb|''The [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]'', by [[Zhang Shengwen]], 1173–1176 AD, [[Song dynasty]] period.]]
The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

===Indian ===
{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}
Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

====History====
[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Ajanta Caves]] in Maharashtra, India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the 2nd century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

=====Mughal =====
[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640–1650]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

=====Modern Indian =====

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]
In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976). Men Shall Know Nothing of This 1923 / Les Hommes n'en sauront rien |publisher=tate.org.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

[[File:Grant Wood - American Gothic - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Grant Wood]], 1930, [[social realism]]]]
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, German Expressionism, Expressionism, and [[modernist]] and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] characterized the European art scene. In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] 1937, protest against Fascism]]
In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

====Abstract expressionism====

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W. W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-04401-0| pages = 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard-edge painting, minimalism, postminimalism, monochrome painting====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

===Influence on Western art===
{{see also|Picasso's African Period|Contemporary African art}}
At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise.

Retrieved on 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where the established [[avant garde]] was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African Art demonstrated the power of supremely well organised forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

'''Hybrid beasts''' appear in the [[folklore]] of a variety of cultures as [[legendary creature]]s.

==In burial sites==
Remains similar to those of mythological hybrids have been found in burial sites discovered by archaeologists. Known combinations include horse-cows, sheep-cows, and a six-legged sheep. The skeletons were formed by ancient peoples who joined together body parts from animal carcasses of different species. The practice is believed to have been done as an offering to their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/weird-horse-cows-6-legged-sheep-found-iron-age-burials-n395871|title=Horse-Cows? Bizarre 'Hybrid' Animals Found in Ancient Burials|publisher=LiveScience|author=Laura Geggel|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These forms' [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s appear across cultures in many [[mythologies]] around the world.

Such hybrids can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as [[mermaid]]s or [[centaur]]s) or non-human hybrids combining two or more non-human animal species (such as the [[griffin]] or the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]). Hybrids often originate as [[zoomorphic]] deities who, over time, are given an [[anthropomorphic]] aspect.

===Paleolithic===
Partly human hybrids appear in [[petroglyph]]s or [[cave painting]]s from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], in [[shamanism|shamanistic]] or [[totemism|totemistic]] contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorized that [[cave paintings]] of beings combining human and animal features were not physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to depict [[shaman]]s in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts or [[power animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Steiger 1999"&gt;{{cite book| last=Steiger| first= B.| year=1999| title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings| location=Farmington Hills, MI| publisher=Visible Ink| isbn=1-57859-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and [[shapeshifting|transformation into animals]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;{{cite book | last=Eliade | first=Mircea | title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: the mysteries of birth and rebirth | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Vinca culture]] of [[Neolithic Europe]] in particular is noted for its frequent depiction of an owl-beaked "[[bird goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;a term of [[Marija Gimbutas]]', see e.g. ''The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols of western civilization'' San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row; London: Thames and Hudson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Seth + Horus = 2 terres.jpg|thumb|The falcon-headed Horus and crane-headed Seth.]]
Examples of humans with animal heads ([[theriocephaly]]) in the [[ancient Egyptian pantheon]] include jackal-headed [[Anubis]], cobra-headed [[Amunet]], lion-headed [[Sekhmet]], falcon-headed [[Horus]], etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a purely anthropomorphic aspect, with the hybrid representation seeking to capture aspects of both of which at once. Similarly, the [[Gaul]]ish ''[[Artio]]'' sculpture found in [[Berne]] shows a juxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.

Non-human hybrids also appear in ancient Egyptian iconography as in [[Ammit]] (combining the [[crocodile]], the [[lion]], and the [[hippopotamus]]).

===Ancient Middle East===
Mythological hybrids became very popular in [[Luwian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] art of the [[Late Bronze Age]] to [[Early Iron Age]]. The angel (human with birds' wings, see [[winged genie]]) the mermaid (part human part fish, see [[Enki]], [[Atargatis]], [[Apkallu]]) and the [[Shedu]] all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]] the ''urmahlullu'', or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially of bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Black, Jeremy A. and Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiggermann |first=F. A. M. |title=Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts |publisher=Styx |year=1992 |isbn = 90-72371-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Babylonian [[Lilitu]] demon, particularly as shown in the [[Burney Relief]] (part-woman, part-owl) prefigures the [[harpy]]/[[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].

===Mediterranean===
[[File:Zeus Typhon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|[[Zeus]] darting his lightning at [[Typhon]], shown as a hybrid with a human torso, bird's wings and a reptilian lower body (Chalcidian black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] Inv. 596).]]

In [[Archaic Greece]], Luwian and Assyrian motifs were imitated, during the [[Orientalizing Period]] (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of the [[Greek mythology|mythology]] of the [[Classical Greek period]], such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Harpy]], the [[Centaur]], the [[Griffin]], the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippocampus]], [[Talos]], [[Pegasus]], etc.

The motif of the winged man appears in the Assyrian [[winged genie]], and is taken up in the Biblical [[Seraphim]] and [[Chayot]], the Etruscan [[Vanth]], Hellenistic [[Eros]]-[[Cupid|Amor]], and ultimately the Christian iconography of [[angel]]s.

The motif of otherwise human figures sporting [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s may derive from partly [[goat]] hybrids (as in [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the [[Devil]] in Christian iconography) or as partly [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] hybrids ([[Minotaur]]). The [[Gundestrup cauldron]] and the [[Pashupati]] figure have [[stag]]'s [[antlers]] (see also [[Horned God]], [[horned helmet]]). The Christian representation of [[Moses]] with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:29–35 by [[Jerome]].

===Hinduism===
[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]], during the festival of [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].]]
The most prominent hybrid in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] iconography is [[elephant]]-headed [[Ganesha]], god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings.

Both [[Nāga]] and [[Garuda]] are non-hybrid mythical animals ([[snake]] and [[bird]], respectively) in their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later iconography.

The [[Hindu deities|god]] [[Vishnu]] is believed to have taken his first four [[incarnation]]s in human-animal form, namely: [[Matsya]] ([[human]] form with [[fish]]'s body below waist), [[Kurma]] (human form with [[turtle]]'s body below waist), [[Varaha]] (human form with a [[boar]]'s head), [[Narasimha]] (human form with [[lion]]'s head).

[[Kamadhenu]], the [[mythical]] cow which is considered to be the mother of all other [[cattle]] is often portrayed as a cow with human head, [[peacock]] tail and bird wings.

'''Insects''' have found uses '''in art''', as [[Insects in culture|in other aspects of culture]], both symbolically and physically, from ancient times. Artforms include the direct usage of [[beetlewing]] ([[elytra]]) in paintings, textiles, and jewellery, as well as the representation of insects in fine arts such as paintings and sculpture. Insects have sometimes formed characteristic features of artforms, as in [[Art Nouveau]] jewellery.

Insect groups represented in art include [[bee]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[orthoptera]]ns ([[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[locust]]s and [[grasshopper]]s) and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].

==Overview==

Societies across the world have from ancient to modern times used the shapes and colours of insects, and sometimes their actual bodies, in their art, whether jewellery or ceramics, body painting or textiles, paintings or sculptures. In North America, the [[Navajo]] make symbolic sandpaintings&lt;!--sic--&gt; of [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]], [[cicada]]s, [[corn bug]]s and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]. The [[Hopi]] draw a variety of insects, but especially butterflies, on pottery. In other parts of the world, insects, most often honeybees, are shown in ancient rock art. [[Australian Aborigine]]s often represented [[totemic]] insects in cave paintings and ritual objects. The art of cultures as widely separated as [[Ancient Greece]], China and Japan includes bees, butterflies, crickets, cicadas and dragonflies.&lt;ref name=Morris2006&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insect groups==

===Bees===

A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East was the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features. Often referred to as the bee "goddess", these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] - gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the artist Anna Collette created over 10,000 ceramic insects at [[Nottingham Castle]] for her work "Stirring the Swarm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Anneka |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/interface/reviews/single/1652788 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://download.cnet.com/Stirring-the-Swarm/3000-12511_4-75660244.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beetles===

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wing cases ([[elytra]]), practised traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]], as well as Africa and South America. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewellery. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were the brilliant green wing cases of jewel beetles in the genus ''[[Sternocera]]'' ([[Buprestidae]]). In Thailand, beetlewings were used to decorate clothing (shawls and [[Sabai]] cloth) and jewellery in court circles.&lt;ref name=Morris2006/&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jeweled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butterflies===
[[File:Joris and Jacob Hoefnagel - Allegory on Life and Death.jpg|thumb|''Allegory on Life and Death'', a collaboration between [[Joris Hoefnagel|Joris]] and [[Jacob Hoefnagel]], 1598. Visible are [[Lepidoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Coleoptera]], and [[Zygoptera]].]]
&lt;!--[[File:Joris Hoefnagel - Flower still life with insects.jpg|thumb|upright|''Flower still life with insects'' by [[Joris Hoefnagel]], 1594]]--&gt;

Butterflies have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov,|first=Vladimir.|title=Speak, Memory.|year=1989|publisher=Vintage International,|location=New York:|page=129|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies: &lt;blockquote&gt;". . . the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common.They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories . . .  In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The photographer Kjell Sanded spent 25 years documenting all 26 characters of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] using the wing patterns of butterflies and moths as "The Butterfly Alphabet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kjell Sandved's Scaly Type |url=http://www.insects.org/ced4/sandved.html |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dragonflies===

[[File:Sikyatkibowlwithdragonfly.png|thumb|[[Dragonfly]] symbol on a [[Hopi]] bowl from [[Sikyátki]], Arizona]]

For some Native American tribes, [[dragonflies]] represent swiftness and activity; for the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], they symbolize pure water. They are a common motif in [[Zuni people|Zuni]] pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in [[Hopi]] rock art and on [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] necklaces.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mitchell | first=Forrest L. | author2=Lasswell, James L. | title=A Dazzle of Dragonflies | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press | year=2005 | isbn=1-58544-459-6 |pages=20–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Images of dragonflies are common in [[Art Nouveau]], especially in [[jewellery]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Moonan | first=Wendy | title=Dragonflies Shimmering as Jewelry | work=New York Times | pages=E2:38 | date=August 13, 1999 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/13/arts/antiques-dragonflies-shimmering-as-jewelry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grasshoppers===
[[File:Grasshopper detail in Rachel Ruysch Flowers in a Vase c 1685.jpg|thumb|Detail of grasshopper on table in [[Rachel Ruysch]]'s painting ''Flowers in a Vase'', c. 1685. National Gallery, London]]

[[Grasshopper]]s are occasionally depicted in artworks, such as the [[Dutch Golden Age]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Balthasar van der Ast]]'s [[still life]] oil painting, ''Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects'', c. 1630, now in the [[National Gallery, London]], though the insect may be a bush-cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/balthasar-van-der-ast-flowers-in-a-vase-with-shells-and-insects|publisher=The National Gallery|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another orthopteran is found in [[Rachel Ruysch]]'s still life ''Flowers in a Vase'', c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a "grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring", according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flowers in a Vase |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rachel-ruysch-flowers-in-a-vase |publisher=The National Gallery |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The National Gallery Podcast: Episode Nineteen |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/podcasts/the-national-gallery-podcast-episode-nineteen |publisher=The National Gallery |accessdate=31 March 2015 |date=May 2008 |quote=Betsy Wieseman: Well, there are two caterpillars that I can see. I particularly like the one right in the foreground that’s just dangling from his thread and looking to land somewhere. It’s this wonderful little suggestion of movement. There’s a grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring to the other side and then nestled up between the rose and the peony is a wonderful spider and an ant on the petals of the rose.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''invisible auditor''' model is a variation of the [[invisible witness]] model. The invisible witness model was put forth by classical [[film theorist]]s such as [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[V. Pudovkin]], and [[André Bazin]]&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"&gt;James Lastra, “Fidelity Versus Intelligibility,” in: Sound Technology and the American Cinema (Columbia UP, 2000), 138-14&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to "account for narration by claiming that editing mimicked the perception of an "invisible observer".&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"/&gt; This model presents the idea that the edits reflect the shifting perception of a "real witness" who moves around the space viewing the scenes.&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"/&gt; When watching a film, it's never shot strictly from the Point of view of the [[cameraman]] but it's shot from a series of different angles all around the scene jumping from [[first person perspective]] to [[bird's-eye view]] to give the perception to the audience that they can see as much detail and perspective of the scene as possible. 

James Lastra takes this model and applies it to [[sound]]. Where the invisible auditor model states that the recording should produce a sound as though it were being heard from the best seat in the house.This can best be understood when talking about "[[sound fidelity]]";the sound recorded or the sound output is as close to the sound of its origins. This created point of [[auditor]], where sound was recorded as though it were being listened to by an invisible auditor from the best seat in the house. This is what music artists strive for in their recordings. "This denotes that there is a [[linear relationship]] between input and output and that the notion of sound fidelity in a [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]/ reproduction system is an assessment of this transparency; a measure of how faithful the reproduction is to the original".&lt;ref&gt;Dow, Robert J. (2010) "Sound Diffusion and the Sonic Image". Retrieved from: http://www.robertdow.org/papers/rdow-sounddiffusion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La maschera e il volto''''' is a comedy of [[grotesque]] genre by [[Luigi Chiarelli]]. Written in 1913 and first presented in 1916, it is [[History of ideas|historically significant]] for starting the contemporary grotesque theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atuttascuola.it/collaborazione/angelotti/luigi_chiarelli.htm Luigi Chiarelli - La maschera e il volto] su atuttascuola.it&lt;/ref&gt; It had a great success first in Italy and then internationally, and continues to be represented. Several movies have been adapted from the play.

'''''Les Grandes Misères de la guerre''''' ({{IPA-fr|lɛ ɡʁɑ̃d mizɛʁ də la ɡɛʁ}}, ''The Great Miseries of War'' or ''The Miseries and Misfortunes of War'') are a series of 18 [[etching]]s by French artist [[Jacques Callot]] (1592–1635), titled in full '''''Les Misères et les Malheurs de la Guerre'''''.  Despite the grand theme of the series, the images are in fact only about 83 mm × 180 mm each, and are called the "large" Miseries to distinguish them from an even smaller earlier set on the same subject.&lt;ref name=becker155&gt;Becker, 155&lt;/ref&gt; The series, published in 1633, is Callot's best-known work and has been called the first "anti-war statement" in European art.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland Harris, 258&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered as an early [[prototype|prototypical]] French comic strip, within the [[text comics]] genre, since the illustrations are accompanied by a descriptive text beneath the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/callot_jacques.htm|title=Jacques Callot|website=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Les Grandes Misères'' depict the destruction unleashed on civilians during the [[Thirty Years' War]]; no specific campaign is depicted, but the set inevitably recalls the actions of the army that [[Cardinal Richelieu]] sent in 1633 to occupy Callot's native [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] before annexing it to France. Callot was living in the capital, [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], at the time, though the prints were published, like most of his work, in Paris, with the necessary royal licence. The plates still exist, in a museum in Nancy, as do seven drawings of whole compositions, and many tiny studies for figures, with a large group in the [[Hermitage Museum]].&lt;ref name=becker155/&gt;

The series begins with a florid title page, followed by an enrollment parade and a battle scene. Plates 4–8 show bands of the victorious soldiers successively attacking a farm, convent, and coach, and burning a village. In plates 9–14 they are rounded up and subjected to various methods of public torture and execution. Plate 15 shows crippled soldiers in a grand neo-classical hospital, Plate 16 unemployed soldiers dying in the street, and Plate 17 the peasants taking revenge on a group they have captured, killing them with [[flail]]s. Plate 18 shows an enthroned king distributing rewards to the victorious generals. 

[[File:Les misères et les malheurs de la guerre - 05 - Le pillage.png|Plate 5: Le pillage|thumb|420px|Plate 5, ''Le pillage'', the soldiers pillage a house]]
Each print has a six-line verse caption below the image, written by the famous print-collector [[Michel de Marolles]]. All show wide panoramic views, with many tiny figures, as is typical of Callot's work. The technique of using [[Jacques Callot#Technical innovations: échoppe, new hard ground, stopping-out|multiple bitings of acid]] on the plate, with different areas "stopped-out", was perfected by Callot. This method allows gradations in the strength of the line, with distant parts of the scene usually lighter.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 155, &amp; illustrations pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The central image of the [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]] in [[William Hogarth]]'s early engraving ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' is a parody of ''La Pendaison''. [[Francisco Goya]] probably owned a set of Callot's etchings, and they are believed to have influenced his similar series, ''[[The Disasters of War|Los Desastres de la guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War''), almost two centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21545">A '''record chart''', also known as a '''music chart''', is a method of ranking [[music]] judging by the [[popularity]] during a given period of time. Examples of record charts are the [[Hit parade]], [[Hot 100]] or [[Top 40]]. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other [[sales]] statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.

Record charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of [[Gramophone record|records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[compact disc]]s; amount of [[radio]] airplay; requests to radio [[disk jockey]]s; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of [[music download|download]]s.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts.  [[Component chart]]s have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

Reviewers often describe records using [[round number]] milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a "Top 10" [[hit single|hit]], even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.

'''Ludwig Fahrenkrog''' (20 October 1867 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1952) was a [[Germany|German]] writer, playwright and artist. He was born in [[Rendsburg]], [[Prussia]], in 1867. He started his career as an artist in his youth, and attended the Berlin Royal Art Academy before being appointed a professor in 1913. He taught at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bremen from 1898 to 1931. He was also involved in the founding of a series of [[Völkisch movement|folkish]] religious groups in the early 20th century, as part of a movement to create what its adherents referred to as a "Germanic religious community".

==Artistic influences==
Fahrenkrog was trained in the classical tradition, and had a successful artistic career. He became a professor of art in 1913, and was later appointed a guest professorship at Dakota University in 1925. In 1928 he received first prize at the Grand Palace exhibition in [[Munich]]. His style, however, is more dependent on [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Symbolist]] influences than on the classical tradition. In an article on Fahrenkrog's work, Marcus Wolff points to "his insistence on the religious nature and mission of art."&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;Marcus Wolff, "Ludwig Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community: Wodan Triumphant" in ''Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition'', Ultra 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The "religious mission" in question is the revival of the pre-Christian Germanic faith and the rejection of Christianity, which is hinted at in paintings such as ''Lucifer's Lossage von Gott'' ([[Lucifer]]'s Renunciation of God, 1898).

While Fahrenkrog's work can be seen in the context of contemporary art movements, it was also strongly influenced by his participation in the religious movement taking place at the same time.

==Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community==
The first group started by Fahrenkrog was the ''Deutscher Bund für Persönlichkeitskultur'' (German League for the Culture of the Personality), which also supported a publication called ''Mehr Licht!'' ("More Light!", the famous last words of [[Goethe]]). He was also involved with the ''Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft'' (German Religious Community [DRG]), which would later change its name several times, first in 1912 to ''Germanische-Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft'' (Germanic-German Religious Community [GDRG]), then in 1915, following a split in the membership, to the ''Deutschgläubige Gemeinschaft'' (Association of the German Faithful [DGG]).

Fahrenkrog remained with the GDRG after several members left following disagreements over the place of the old Germanic gods and the inclusion of a partly Jewish member, and shortly thereafter the group changed its name to the ''Germanische Glaubens Gemeinschaft'' ([[Germanic Faith-Community]] [GGG]), its final form. In 1916, the group set out ten points of common belief which they later published in ''Das Deutsche Buch'' (The German Book).

In 1923, the GGG's sixth year of existence, Fahrenkrog gave a speech that emphasized the non-political nature of the group, and stated the goal of "ascent and united will of all Germanic people."&lt;ref name="Wolff"/&gt; At that point, the group had a large membership spread across several neighboring countries, and plans for further growth included the building of a Germanic temple designed by Fahrenkrog's stepson.

However, the temple's construction was obstructed by protests from local Christian groups and disagreement among GGG members, and it was never finished. In 1925, Fahrenkrog and Adolf Kroll, another early member, argued over the role that the ''[[Edda]]'' should play in the group's mythology. Fahrenkrog believed that the GGG should evolve a new mythos incorporating but not dependent upon the ''Edda'', Kroll apparently seeing this as disloyalty to the old Germanic myths.

==The GGG under the Third Reich==
When the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in 1933, they outlawed almost all other groups not affiliated with the party. The GGG, however, was not forced to disband, partly, says Wolff, "because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist." Nevertheless, some of its activities were limited. They could no longer hold public meetings, and after 1938 could no longer use the [[swastika]], which the GGG had been using as its symbol since 1908. 

Fahrenkrog himself was reluctant to use the greeting "Heil Hitler!" in letters, and as a result never gained any recognition within the party. In 1934, an exhibit of his paintings was prohibited by the ministry of [[propaganda]].

'''''Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game''''' is a book by [[Michael Lewis]], published in 2003, about the [[Oakland Athletics]] baseball team and its [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Billy Beane]]. Its focus is the team's [[Analytics|analytical]], evidence-based, [[sabermetric]] approach to assembling a competitive [[baseball]] team despite Oakland's small budget. [[Moneyball (film)|A film]] based on the book, starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jonah Hill]], was released in 2011.

==Synopsis==
The central premise of ''Moneyball'' is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the [[front office]]) over the past century is subjective and often flawed. Statistics such as [[stolen base]]s, [[run batted in|runs batted in]], and [[batting average]], typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts are experienced in the sport, usually having been players or coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Study of Sabermetrics in Major League Baseball: The Impact of Moneyball on Free Agent Salaries|url=http://olinblog.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/AStudyofSabermetricsinMajorLeagueBaseball.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that the Oakland A's' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could better compete against richer competitors in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).

Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that [[on-base percentage]] and [[slugging percentage]] are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.

By re-evaluating their strategy in this way, the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 Athletics]], with approximately $44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], who spent over $125 million in payroll that season. Because of its smaller budget, Oakland had to find players undervalued by the market, and their system has proven itself thus far. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.

Lewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of [[sabermetrics]]), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and "the ruthless drive for efficiency that [[capitalism]] demands". The book also touches on Oakland's underlying economic need to stay ahead of the curve; as other teams begin mirroring Beane's strategies to evaluate offensive talent, diminishing the Athletics' advantage, Oakland begins looking for other undervalued baseball skills, such as defensive capabilities.

[[File:MONEYBALLchart.png|thumb|left|467px|Distribution of team salaries in 2002. Team salaries ranged from about $35 million (the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]) to about $120 million (the [[New York Yankees]])&lt;br&gt; The [[Oakland Athletics]] had the third-lowest team payroll in the league (about $40 million) marginally higher than that of the [[Montreal Expos]], whose franchise was transferred to the Washington Nationals in 2005.]]

''Moneyball'' also touches on the A's' methods of prospect selection. Sabermetricians argue that a [[college baseball]] player's chance of MLB success is much higher than a traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more polished college players. Lewis cites A's minor leaguer [[Jeremy Bonderman]], drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional "tools" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop. Lewis explores the A's approach to the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft|2002 MLB draft]], when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.

''Moneyball'' traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as [[Bill James]] (now a member of the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[front office]]) and [[Craig R. Wright]]. Lewis explores how James's seminal ''[[Baseball Abstract]]'', published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball minds that are now joining the ranks of baseball management.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Impact==
''Moneyball'' has entered baseball's lexicon; teams that value sabermetrics are often said to be playing "''Moneyball''." Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged ''Moneyball'' for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, ''Moneyball'' changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the [[New York Mets]], [[New York Yankees]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Cleveland Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolner |first=Keith |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6187 |title=Articles &amp;#124; Aim For The Head: Aim For the Front Office |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]  have hired full-time [[Sabermetrician|sabermetric analysts]].

When the Mets hired [[Sandy Alderson]] &amp;ndash; Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's &amp;ndash; as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates [[Paul DePodesta]] and [[J.P. Ricciardi]] to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the "Moneyball Mets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/news/sports/games/sandy-alderson-2011-4/ |title = The Moneyball Mets |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 25 March 2011 |accessdate = 2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets have been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the [[2015 World Series]] (defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], en route).

Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/09/18/SP3J1L571K.DTL&amp;ao=all |title = Michael Lewis on A's 'Moneyball' legacy |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date = 18 September 2011 |accessdate = 2011-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daryl Morey]]'s own unorthodox approaches in the NBA have been called "Moreyball".

Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to ''Moneyball'' called ''Underdogs'', revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.

==People discussed in the book==
''Moneyball'' also covers the lives and careers of several baseball personalities. The central one is [[Billy Beane]], whose failed playing career is contrasted with wildly optimistic predictions by scouts.

Players and people discussed in ''Moneyball'':

===Oakland farm system===
[[Image:Swisher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nick Swisher]], the prospect the traditional scouts and statisticians agreed upon.]]
*[[Barry Zito]] – [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]] [[American League|AL]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young winner]], part of the "Big 3" with Mulder and Hudson (below)
*[[Mark Mulder]] – part of the "Big 3" with Zito and Hudson
*[[Tim Hudson]] – Not drafted by Beane; part of the "Big 3" with Mulder and Zito
*[[Kirk Saarloos]]
*[[John Baker (baseball)|John Baker]]
*[[Joe Blanton]]
*[[Jason Giambi]] – Not drafted by Beane. [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]] AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], signed with the [[New York Yankees]] in 2002 for $120 million over 7 years
*[[Miguel Tejada]] – Not drafted by Beane; 2002 AL MVP
*[[Eric Chavez]] – Not drafted by Beane; six-time AL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove winner]]
*[[Jeremy Brown]]
*[[Nick Swisher]]
*[[Bobby Crosby]]
*[[Mark Teahen]]
*[[Jeremy Bonderman]] – traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 2002

===Oakland bullpen===
*[[Jason Isringhausen]] – signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2001–02 offseason
*[[Billy Koch]] – 2002 AL Relief Pitcher of the Year
*[[Chad Bradford]]
*[[Jim Mecir]]
*[[Ricardo Rincón]]
*[[Mike Magnante]]

===Other players===
[[File:KevinYouklis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Kevin Youkilis]]]]
*[[Kevin Youkilis]] – referred to in the book as the "Greek God of Walks". Youkilis was drafted in 2001 by the [[Boston Red Sox]] and heavily desired by Beane, who tried to snare him via a failed three-team trade discussed in the book.
*[[Prince Fielder]] – son of former [[slugging percentage|slugger]] [[Cecil Fielder]], drafted in 2002 year by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Claimed by Beane to be "too fat" even for the A's.
*B. J. Upton, now known by his birth name of [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] – cited as an example of "bad [[high school]]" draft pick.
*[[Scott Kazmir]] – cited as an example of teams' – in this case the [[New York Mets]] – foolishness in drafting high school [[pitcher]]s because of the difficulty in projecting their future, as opposed to college players.
*[[Jamie Moyer]] – then with the [[Seattle Mariners]]
*[[Ray Durham]] – traded to the Oakland A's in the middle of 2002, cited as a potent base-stealer and "rent-a-player": an impending free agent who would likely attract large offers from other clubs with larger available payrolls than Oakland's while leaving Oakland with draft picks in the next year's draft, a rule since abolished with the 2011 [[Major League Baseball Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. Durham would eventually sign with the [[San Francisco Giants]].
*[[Terrence Long]]
*[[Erik Hiljus]]
*[[David Justice]]
*[[Jeremy Giambi]]
*[[Alex Rodriguez]] – Beane compares A-Rod's stats to those of [[Eric Chavez]].

== Reception ==
[[Richard Thaler|Richard H. Thaler]] of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School described the book as a "sensation... Lewis has a wonderful story to tell, and he tells it wonderfully... Lewis also raises some serious puzzles that he does not resolve, and his account has some large and perhaps profound implications that he does not much explore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/61123/whos-first|title=Who's On First|date=2003-09-01|website=New Republic|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Haglund of [[Slate Magazine|Slate]] and [[Jonah Keri]] of [[Grantland]] have both criticized the book for glossing over key young talent acquired through the draft and signed internationally. Specifically, they have argued that the book ignores the pitching trio of [[Tim Hudson]], [[Mark Mulder]], and [[Barry Zito]], as well as position players such as [[Eric Chavez]] and [[Miguel Tejada]], all of whom were discovered via traditional scouting methodology and were key contributors to the success of the 2002 Athletics. In 2002, Barry Zito received the [[AL Cy Young Award]] and Miguel Tejada received the [[AL MVP Award]].

==Film==
{{Main article|Moneyball (film)}}
A movie based on the book was released in 2011. Actor [[Brad Pitt]] stars as [[Billy Beane]], while [[Jonah Hill]] plays a fictional character based on [[Paul DePodesta]]; [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] plays A's manager [[Art Howe]]. [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Steve Zaillian]] was hired to write the script, and [[Steven Soderbergh]] was slated to direct, replacing [[David Frankel]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. [http://www.variety.com/VR1117994175.html "Columbia pitches ''Moneyball'' to Pitt", Variety (October 16, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; But in June 2009, because of conflicts over a revised script by Soderbergh, Sony put the movie on hold just days before it was scheduled to begin shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4278999 |title="Benched: 'Moneyball' Flick on Hold at Last Minute", Associated Press (June 22, 2009) |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soderbergh was eventually let go.

''Moneyball'' was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

==In popular culture==
The book is parodied in the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[MoneyBART]]", in which [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] manages [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s [[Little League]] baseball team using sabermetric principles. [[Bill James]] made an appearance in this episode.

'''MozartNu (1986–2008)''' is a contemporary dance performance conceived by the Spanish director, [[Iago Pericot]]. It is derived from Pericot's ''MozartNu'', which premiered in 1986. The original 1986 version of ''MozartNu'', inspired by the [[Coronation Mass (Mozart)|Coronation Mass]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], showed the beauty of human relationships through the naked bodies of two dancers.

In ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'', the original version is performed by one couple on one platform, while another couple dances simultaneously on a separate platform on the same stage. These parallel performances reflect the changes that have been the result of these human relationships over time.

The premiere production of ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'' was April 15–20, 2008 at ''El Mercat de les Flors'' in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name = "lugaresnaturistas.org"&gt;{{Cite web | title = MozartNu (1986-2008) - The human beauty and musical | publisher = lugaresnaturistas.org | url = http://www.lugaresnaturistas.org/mozartnu.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older dancers were the dancers who performed in the original ''MozartNu'' of 1986.

The '''Newington-Cropsey Foundation''' ('''NCF''') is a nonprofit private organization based in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]]. The foundation's aim is to maintain and preserve the works of [[Jasper Cropsey]] and the art movement he was a part of, the [[Hudson River School]]. The foundation also promotes [[Representation (arts)|representational]] painting and sculpture.

The organization was founded in 1977 by Barbara and John Newington to collect and promote works of Barbara's great-grandfather Jasper Cropsey, as well as other non-abstract art.&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

The NCF offers free tours of its properties: [[Ever Rest]], the last home and studio of [[Jasper Cropsey]], and the Gallery of Art Building, a museum dedicated to the works of Cropsey. The properties are adjacent to each other in the village of Hastings-on-Hudson.

==Organization==
The foundation's stated aim is to preserve the moral, artistic and religious values of [[Jasper Cropsey]] and the [[Hudson River School]],&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; as well as to "recapture a little sense of stability, security and beauty that was so much a part of the 19th century".&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The foundation also promotes [[Representation (arts)|representational]] painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The foundation does not seek publicity, intending to stay less noticed by the general public.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; Other than including listings in local guidebooks, the NCF has no marketing.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt;

The nonprofit organization is privately owned.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The current chairman is Barbara Newington, the executive director is Adelia C. Rasines, and the foundation's director is Anthony Speiser; all three also act as trustees.&lt;ref name="Homepage"/&gt; The organization provides grants to representational artists and classes to sculptors of classical works; it also publishes ''American Arts Quarterly'', a journal for non-abstract art.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

The NCF maintains a large collection of Cropsey's paintings: about 100 oil and 30 watercolor paintings.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt; It is seen as the leading authority on Cropsey paintings.&lt;ref name="NYT4"/&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
After Jasper Cropsey's death in 1900, his wife Maria Cropsey still lived in Ever Rest, until her death in 1906. Jasper Cropsey's granddaughter Isabel subsequently inherited the property and began buying back some of Cropsey's paintings. Isabel and her husband William Steinschneider lived there, raising their daughter Barbara in the house. William was a six-term mayor of Hastings.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melvin3"/&gt; Isabel died in 1958 and William in 1970, making William the last to live in the house; Barbara inherited it. Their daughter, married as Barbara Newington, aggressively pursued Cropsey's paintings alongside her husband John until about the 1980s, while Cropsey paintings were still inexpensive.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; Barbara and John Newington created the Newington-Cropsey Foundation and its properties in 1977 with concern over the state of modern art and "the way culture was going".&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

Newington, today the foundation's chairman, is a philanthropist living in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and is the great-granddaughter of Cropsey.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

Around 1977, the foundation traded land with the village of Hastings, giving the village land and $400,000 for a garage for its department of public works.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melvin3"/&gt; In turn, the NCF acquired a {{convert|6|acre|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt; parcel of land and the village's existing public works garage, on a site that was formerly the town dump for decades, and was called Frog Hollow around Cropsey's time.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; The NCF's initial plans were to renovate the garage, landscape the property, restore the pond, and construct steps to connect the property to Ever Rest, in total "to make [the property] look like a Cropsey painting".&lt;ref name="Melvin3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=Hastings Weighs Museum Proposal|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/01/nyregion/hastings-weighs-museum-proposal.html|date=July 1, 1984|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the NCF was among several museums and private collectors that lent items to "An Unprejudiced Eye", an exhibit of Cropsey's works. The exhibit was at the [[Hudson River Museum]] and was created by the village of Hastings, marking its association with Cropsey and its 100th anniversary. NCF art historian Kenneth Maddox organized and curated the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Raynor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raynor|first=Vivien|title=An Eye on a Hastings Artist of Old|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/30/archives/westchester-weekly-an-eye-on-a-hastings-artist-of-old.html|date=December 30, 1979|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1988, the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] cleaned up oil from Sugar Pond, a small pond on the property. The department approved the project and its environmental assessment report.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s, the NCF contracted the construction of an intricately landscaped 19th-century arts complex with three buildings, a pond, and a garden, designed by Peter Gisolfi Associates of Hastings.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The first building, the New Studio, opened in 1990 with an exhibition of paintings by Hudson River School artist [[Worthington Whittredge]]. The site was also slated to include a gatekeeper's cottage, a library and administration center, an outdoor amphitheater, as well as a {{convert|10000|sqft|adj=on}} museum, which was to be completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="Melvin2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=Cropsey Art Complex To Open First Building|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/nyregion/cropsey-art-complex-to-open-first-building.html|date=December 2, 1990|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial planning phase for the complex, the village's historical society intervened, expressing curiosity over possible remains in the ravine. The society urged the village's planning board to put a hold on construction so the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] could make preliminary tests in the ravine. The historical society president described the site as "our village's cradle of civilization – where our early industry started"; another member of the society expressed that the site was "the least-disturbed 19th-century industrial site in Westchester County". The executive director of the Westchester County Historical Society (a former president of the Hastings Historical Society) supported an archaeological study, and described that the site was previously the confluence of two streams where three early mills operated, including a bone mill and brass and iron-turning factory. Since then, the site was home to the Hastings Pavement and Brick factory, the Cottlet Hotel, and a Hastings Department of Public Works building. The public works building's foundation still remained, and the NCF had planned to build on top of it. The NCF was opposed to archaeological studies as it would require dynamiting the foundation and would disturb the fragile site, including a 125-year-old retaining wall. Greg Wyatt, director of the project, was concerned delays would lead to costs excessive of their $2.7 million budget. The construction was approved pending the archaeological study, paid for by the NCF and directed by a state-approved archaeologist with a specialty in early industry.&lt;ref name="Brenner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=Elsa|title=Art and Archeology Clash Over Ravine Near Cropsey Studio|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/nyregion/art-and-archeology-clash-over-ravine-near-cropsey-studio.html|date=September 10, 1989|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Newington was considered a friend of the Hastings Historical Society, and had given the organization its first substantial home. The NCF gave them a $42,000 grant and a 5-year $1 lease to a cottage next to Ever Rest, which the historical society used until its relocation to its current home, the [[Henry Draper Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Melvin1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=In Hastings, A Treasury of History|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/nyregion/in-hastings-a-treasury-of-history.html|date=February 7, 1988|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallery of Art opened on October 16, 1994.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt;

===Garden of Great Ideas===
[[File:Central Library of Vanderbilt University.JPG|thumb|''Tree of Learning'' by [[Greg Wyatt]], in front of [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Heard Library|Central Library]]]]
Beginning in May 1997, the foundation partnered with [[Vanderbilt University]] to create a sculpture garden on the university campus, to be known as the "Garden of Great Ideas".&lt;ref name="Van2"/&gt; Then-US Republican Senator [[Fred Thompson]] brought the idea of the sculpture garden to the university's chancellor [[Joe B. Wyatt]], who visited the NCF and decided to partner with the organization.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt; 

Students of the NCF's Academy of Art, including six young artists, would create the bronze sculptures. The NCF's goal was the placement of many sculptures on numerous college campuses as a link between scholarship and artistry. By 1997, the NCF had already donated ''Bill of Rights Eagle'', a sculpture by  NCF Academy of Art Director [[Greg Wyatt]] to the college. The NCF planned to donate 15 to 20 additional bronze sculptures by the students for permanent exhibiton,&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt; added over the following three to five years. The final piece would also be by Wyatt, a sculpture named ''Tree of Knowledge'' placed in front of the [[Jean and Alexander Heard Library]].&lt;ref name="Van2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shick|first=Ellie|title='Garden of Great Ideas' brings original sculptures to campus|newspaper=Vanderbilt Register|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=7560.html|date=May 5, 1997|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Jamie Lawson|title=Newington-Cropsey artists visit campus, present proposals for bronze works|newspaper=Vanderbilt Register|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=9297.html|date=October 27, 1997|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art program had numerous criticisms. The university's art community and faculty were largely not consulted on the decision. One professor at the school expressed dismay that the "program is nowhere near the avant-garde of our own age", and that the sculptures were placed in so many areas of the campus that it could impede other gifts or exhibitions on campus. An art professor found the sculptures to not achieve the school's goals of quality and diversity, noting one material, one presentation, and generic ideas symbolized by the works. As well, 
no Vanderbilt students were among the student artists.&lt;ref name="Pulle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulle|first=Matt|title=Not-So-Fine Art|newspaper=[[Nashville Scene]]|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13005115/notsofine-art|date=November 16, 2000|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tree of Learning'' provoked the most opposition from professors, seen as a "boring and unchallenging" reproduction of a barren or burnt dead tree. Judson Newbern, associate vice chancellor of the college, admitted the tree looks dead, and requested Wyatt weld leaves and buds onto his work. Newbern did defend the program overall, and noted that the student artists are diverse in ethnicity and gender.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt;

A committee of professors was not created to approve this project as the vice chancellor did not want the project to be a missed opportunity if obstacles came up. It was noted that the NCF appeared right-leaning, with stated goals to "advance and promote the values inherent in the 19th century...including the belief that God created nature". The NCF also promotes "strong national pride in America". Professor Cecilia Tichi was against the works for their values, in believing that campuses are a place to stretch people's minds.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt;

===Further history===
Sculptor Joseph Petrovics, who sculpted the [[National Iwo Jima Memorial]] and the [[FDNY memorial wall]], was a Studio Instructor at the Newington-Cropsey Foundation Academy of Art beginning in 1993.&lt;ref name="Aristos"/&gt;

From 1994 until about 2005, the NCF hosted the Hudson Valley Art Association's Annual Exhibition; Newington and the foundation had been long-time supporters of the association, which was established by a small group of artists who first met at Ever Rest in 1928.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HVAA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudman|first=Joan|title=The History of the Hudson Valley Art Association|publisher=Hudson Valley Art Association|url=https://www.hudsonart.org/history|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NCF spent $500,000 to create a Christian [[docudrama]] ''Lost Letters of Faith'', a story about King [[Abgar of Edessa]]. The foundation filmed the production at [[Regent University]]. Terry Lindvall, a film and religious studies scholar and a former president of Regent University, assembled filmmakers for the drama.&lt;ref name="Vegh"/&gt; Another of their film projects, called ''Cradle of Genius'', focused on [[divine inspiration]] and the composers [[Brahms]], [[Puccini]], and [[Richard Strauss]]. It was based on Arthur Abell's ''Talks with Great Composers''.&lt;ref name="Cradle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle of Genius: Newington Cropsey Foundation Production|url=http://www.newingtoncropsey.com/ncffilm/cradle/cradle.htm|date=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312014736/http://www.newingtoncropsey.com/ncffilm/cradle/cradle.htm|archive-date=March 12, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 to 2017, Greg Wyatt installed a series of busts at the [[Boscobel (mansion)|Boscobel House and Gardens]] in [[Garrison, New York]]. Adjacent to the house, the property contains a permanent sculpture garden with ten bronze busts of significant Hudson River School artists. The sculptures are by Wyatt and were donated by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. Boscobel was chosen to house the works because of its location in the [[Hudson Highlands]], which was a popular subject of the school's painters, and because the area roughly lies in the geographic center of Hudson River School artist homes and the landscapes that they painted. The busts include a biography of each artist, on the back of each sculpture, and the works also combine elements of the Hudson River School artists' paintings into them.&lt;ref name="BHG-NCF"&gt;{{cite news|last=Deffenbaugh|first=Ryan|title=Boscobel Sculptures Capture Hudson River School|newspaper=Wag Magazine|url=http://www.wagmag.com/boscobel-sculptures-capture-hudson-river-school/|date=September 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden opened with three works in late 2015, and an additional seven were added by November 2017 when the site was dedicated.&lt;ref name="2016AR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boscobel House and Gardens: 2016 Annual Report|publisher=Boscobel House and Gardens|page=4|url=https://www.boscobel.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Boscobel-2016-Annual-Report.pdf|date=2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever Rest and the Gallery of Art are part of the Hudson River School Art Trail, a project of the [[Thomas Cole National Historic Site]].&lt;ref name="ArtTrail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTArtTrail"/&gt;

==Ever Rest==
[[File:NCF Ever Rest.jpg|thumb|Cropsey's home [[Ever Rest]]]]
[[Ever Rest]], the cottage and last home of Jasper Cropsey, is a {{convert|4.5|acre|adj=on}} site managed by the foundation. The site is at 49 Washington Avenue in Hastings.&lt;ref name="Faber"&gt;{{cite news|last=Faber|first=Harold|title=The Legacy of the Hudson River School|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/arts/the-legacy-of-the-hudson-river-school.html|date=June 10, 1988|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home is open for free tours by appointment as a [[historic house museum]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The bright yellow [[board-and-batten]]&lt;ref name="Faber"/&gt; [[Carpenter Gothic]]&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; cottage is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]],&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; and was Cropsey's home from 1885 until his death in 1900.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt; The home houses about 40 to 50 of Cropsey's works, including many watercolors.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt;

==Gallery of Art==
The Gallery of Art building is located in a ravine {{convert|60|ft}}&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt; beneath Ever Rest, overlooking the nearby Hudson River and [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|the Palisades]] and behind a commuter parking lot of the [[Hastings-on-Hudson station|Hastings-on-Hudson]] Metro-North station.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt; There lies a small campus of buildings, including an archive of Cropsey's papers.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; The site's administration building houses the office of ''American Arts Quarterly'', a publication for Hudson River Realistic painting, with a circulation of about 3,000. The upper floor has a library with about 4,000 books on 19th century painting, along with a computer library and databanks.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;

The museum is dedicated to the paintings and sculptures of Cropsey and other artists of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; It holds roughly 75 paintings of Cropsey's, many with scenes from England and Rome, where Cropsey visited, and allegorical works from the 1850s.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; It is open for free tours by appointment.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

The yellow Gothic Revival&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; or [[Palladian style]]&lt;ref name="NYT5"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=Critic's Notebook; Home Is Where the Easel and Quirks Are|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-home-is-where-the-easel-and-quirks-are.html|date=August 28, 1998|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; museum building was built in 1994&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; and designed by Atlanta architects [[Rodney Mims Cook Jr.]] and Peter J. Polites of PolitesCook Architects.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Along with the surrounding landscape, it was constructed at a cost of about $4 million.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The building was designed to resemble a relic from a paste era, recapturing beauty and stability of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The building uses many principles of classical architecture, including sunlight directed onto the rotunda's floor.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

''New York Times'' art critic [[Roberta Smith]] found the building to be "garishly inappropriate and amateurish", with "badly scaled architecture". She noted that the building's main gallery has Cropsey paintings hung well above eye level, poorly lit, and with unlabeled and overcleaned paintings. She found Cropsey's works better-suited and more easy to see at Ever Rest.&lt;ref name="NYT5"/&gt;

===Exterior===
The building's exterior has wrought iron doors and a canopy, along with arches and turrets.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The parkland surrounding and in front of the gallery includes a [[duck pond]] with [[duck house]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

===Interior===
The rotunda was modeled after the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]];&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; its terrazzo floor was modeled after the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]] in Rome. The rotunda also has friezes of scenes of [[History of the Hudson River|Hudson River history]]. Surrounding the rotunda walls is an inscribed quotation from Cropsey:&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;
{{bquote|Ambition may be praiseworthy when its aim is that of excellence and the fountain from which it draws nourishment that of almighty wisdom.|Jasper Francis Cropsey&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;}}

The main gallery is an octagonal Victorian room with maroon-flocked wallpaper above dark oak wainscoting and a timber ceiling, with a large oak staircase to the second floor.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The room features Cropsey paintings from its floor to ceiling; the light is kept low, allowing the paintings to glow.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; It was designed after Hudson River houses including Ever Rest and [[Lyndhurst (mansion)|Lyndhurst]]. [[David Linley]] designed furniture in the building.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The building also has commissioned sculptures and religious statues, including a replica of [[Abgar V#The Letter of King Abgar to Jesus|an inscribed]] [[lintel]], with a message from King [[Abgar of Edessa]] to Jesus Christ. The building holds a research library of Hudson River School art and painters, which the organization aims to make the most complete resource for artists of the school within Westchester County.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The space also has a gallery for temporary exhibitions by contemporary representational artists.&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

The '''No Show Museum''' is an [[art museum]], established in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 2015, devoted to [[nothing]] and its various manifestations throughout the [[history of art]]. It claims to be the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;cf.: Art in Berlin: "[http://www.art-in-berlin.de/incbmeld.php?id=3672 Dem Nichts Raum geben]"&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Swiss conceptual artist and curator [[Andreas Heusser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andreasheusser.com/ | title=Andreas Heusser }}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum's collection today includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Virtual collection==
The museum's collection is freely accessible online and displays works, documents, and artifacts from conceptual art, minimalist art, performance art, and painting, as well as from photography, literature, theatre,  film, and music. In all, the collection extends over four  ours, each with two wings, and with various tracts that are thematically dedicated to different way of approaching nothing:
* Nothing as Refusal: The Art of Doing Nothing
* Nothing as Annihilation: The Art of Destruction
* Nothing as Emptiness: The Art of Absence
* Nothing as Invisibility: The Art of The Imperceptible, The Unseen, and The Hidden 
* Nothing as Reduction: The Art of Minimalism
* Nothing as Lacuna: The Art of Omission
* Nothing as Statement: The Art of Saying Nothing Nothing as Notion: The Art of Pure Imagination

The museum also provides background information in German, Spanish and English about all the works and artists. In addition, there is library that provides texts, publications, and exhibition catalogues for further research on nothing in art and other disciplines (philosophy, science, literature, music, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Nana Adusei-Poku: [http://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/101727/on-being-present-where-you-wish-to-disappear/ On Being Present Where You Wish to Disappear]. In: Journal #80 - March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile museum==
=== Converted bus ===
Since 2015, the No Show Museum has been on a world tour with a converted bus. Inside, the mobile museum is a futuristic white cube (4 m long, 2 m wide, 2.10 m high), in which the current special exhibition is shown. It also offers access to the virtual collection via ipad stations and houses the museum shop with a limited selection of souvenirs such as the BUY NOTHING CARD® (personal credit card to buy nothing) or ART FREE AIR® (medicine for allergy sufferers). The matt black painted exterior of the bus serves as a moving blackboard, which can be labeled with announcements and information about the current exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Laura B. Villalta: [http://americanosfera.org/2017/11/museo-de-la-nada-en-marte/ Museo de la Nada en MARTE]. Americanosfera, 16.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic special exhibitions ===
The special exhibitions in the Mobile Museum each illuminate certain aspects, variants and themes of nothingness in art: '' INVISIBLE ARTWORKS '' (2015) presented 24 intangible and invisible works of conceptual art. The show '' NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE ''(2016) focused on works of art that do not exist and can not possibly exist (eg because it simply exceeds the possibilities of producing the artwork, or because trying to realize it leads to unsolvable conceptual and logical contradictions.) The special exhibition '' ¡NO FALTA NADA! '' (2017) was about the art of nothing as an absence, eg because the artwork has been lost or irrevocably destroyed, or because it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnulfo Agüero: [https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2017/12/11/cultura/2345136-viaje-espectacular-del-arte-las-regiones-la-nada Un viaje espectacular del arte a las regiones de la nada]. La Prensa, 12.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nothing world tour==
The No Show Museum has committed itself to the mission to spread nothing all over the globe. For this reason, the museum is touring year after year from continent to continent.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Deutsches Museum (Ed.): Kultur &amp; Technik. Nichts, Edition 1/2018. Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the World Tour started in Zurich in July 2015 and led through 20 countries of Central and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carina Pérez: [http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/76607/llega-el-no-show-museum-al-maco Llega el No Show Museum al MACO]. NVI Noticias, 18.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt; It included around 30 exhibitions in [[museums]] and empty [[Art museum|galleries]] in [[public spaces]] and remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;See: Documentation on [http://www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum] or on [http://www.noshowmuseum.com www.noshowmuseum.com], section "Archive/Past Exhibitions"&lt;/ref&gt; The tour ended in October 2015 with an exhibition and presentation of nothing in [[Venice]] where the No Show Museum was invited by Pro Helvetia's Salon Suisse as an official participant of the [[Biennale di Venezia|56th Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan: "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt;
The third stage took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Baja California in Mexico through the countries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama) to Colombia, with numerous exhibitions in public space and in collaboration with museums and local galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Moreno: [https://elperiodico.com.gt/oculta/2017/11/28/el-arte-en-la-ausencia/ El arte en la ausencia].

==Conceptual background==

===Nothing as an aesthetic category ===
In the course of the 20th century, [[nothing]] has become as distinctive an aesthetic category as “the beautiful”, “the ugly” or "the absurd".&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lucy R. Lippard, Six Years: "The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972". New York, Praeger, 1973, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic examination of the (non) [[phenomenon]] "nothing" has led artists and critics to question the traditional practices of art production and open up new possibilities of spatial, temporal and material interpretation. Nothing is usually understood as the [[negation]] of being and figuration, but strictly speaking, it is impossible to define nothing.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lütkehaus, Ludger: "Nichts", Haffmans Verlag, Zürich 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Every attempt to describe, represent or materialize nothing is doomed to fail, and it is this very fact that has inspired many artists of the [[20th century]] to work intensively with [[nothing]] and the [[paradoxes]] of its (re)presentation.
The result is a large number of artistic strategies and works on nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See the following exhibition catalogues on nothing:
* Armleder, John; Copeland, Matthieu; Le Bon, Laurent; Metzger, Gustav; Perret, MaiThu; Phillpot, Clive and Pirotte, Philippe (eds): "Voids: A Retrospective", Zürich : JRP Ringier, 2009
* Hollein, Max, Weinhart, Martina: "Nichts – Nothing", Ostfildern : Hatje Cantz, 2006
* Rugoff, Ralph: "Art about the Unseen", 1957-2012, London: Hayward Publishing, 2012
* Varnedoe, Kirk: "Pictures of Nothing. Abstract Art since Pollock", Princeton/Oxford : Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nothing as a ready-made===
Already in 1913, [[Marcel Duchamp]] demonstrated with his first [[ready-mades]] how any object can be converted into art by removing it from the sphere of ordinary life and placing it in a gallery or [[museum]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dorothee Fauth: "Kunstlexikon: Readymade". Hatje Cantz 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This move from one context to another changes the way spectators view an object: in the context of art, it is no longer perceived as a mere object, but instead as placeholder of an idea or of an artistic intention. The result of such attributions is that the formerly ordinary object is transformed into a [[work of art]].
The same principle can be applied to [[nothing]], and [[nothing]] can equally acquire “the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of the artist” (André Breton).&lt;ref&gt;Hector Olbak: "[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/obalk.html The Unfindable Readymade]"&lt;/ref&gt; The No Show Museum is an attempt to create such an [[institutional framework]] for ensuring in the long run that nothing is art.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The museum as a mobile art context===
Although the museum’s collection is [[virtuality|virtual]], the museum does have a physical space for presentations setup in a restored and customized post bus.  Thus, the museum provides a moving art context that can either be attached to established institutions are function autonomously.  Moreover, the mobile museum offers the opportunity to discover new regions and spaces for the contexts of nothing, and it serves as a marker to indicate any place as an exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]". Tages-Anzeiger (2015-05-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Story-teller reciting from the "Arabian Nights." (1911) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|A Story-teller reciting from the "Arabian Nights" - 1911]]
[[File:Indian Kathakar Storyteller 1913.jpg|thumb|''Vyasa'' (sitting on high table), the common title for Indian oral storytellers, reciting epics among villagers, 1913]]
'''Oral [[storytelling]]''' is an ancient and intimate [[tradition]] between the storyteller and their audience. The storyteller and the listeners are physically close, often seated together in a circular fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the telling of the story people become psychically close, developing a connection to one another through the communal experience. The storyteller reveals, and thus shares, him/her self through his/her telling and the listeners reveal and share themselves through their reception of the story. The intimacy and connection is deepened by the flexibility of oral storytelling which allows the tale to be moulded according to the needs of the audience and/or the location or environment of the telling. Listeners also experience the urgency of a creative process taking place in their presence and they experience the  empowerment of being a part of that creative process. Storytelling creates a personal bond with the teller and the audience.

The flexibility of oral storytelling extends to the teller. Each teller will incorporate their own personality and may choose to add characters into the story. As a result, there will be numerous variations of a single story.&lt;ref&gt;Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Some tellers consider anything outside the [[narrative]] as extraneous while other storytellers choose to enhance their telling of the tale with the addition of [[visual]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] tools, specific actions and creative strategies and devices.

Storytelling may be performed in many forms: in prose, in poetic form, as a song, accompanied with dance or some kind of theatrical performance, etc.

==Human need==
[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Storyteller Under Sunny Skies clay sculpture.jpg|thumb|left|"Storyteller Under Sunny Skies," a clay sculpture by Rose Pecos-Sun Rhodes (Jemez Pueblo), 1993, in the permanent collection of [[The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis]]]]
It is likely that oral storytelling has been around as long as human [[language]]. Storytelling fulfills the need for human beings to cast their experiences in narrative form. Our ancestors probably gathered around the evening fires and expressed their fears, their beliefs and their heroism through oral [[narrative]]s. This long tradition of storytelling is evident in ancient [[cultures]] such as the [[Australian Aborigines]]. Community storytelling offered the security of explanation; how life and its many forms began and why things happen, as well as entertainment and enchantment. Communities were strengthened and maintained through stories that connected the present, the past and the future.

Telling stories is a nurturing act for the listener, who is connected to the storyteller through the story, as well as for the storyteller who is connected to the listeners through the story.

==History==
[[File:Dastangoi dastango.jpg|thumb|An Indian traditional oral storytller [[Dastangoi]] artist reciting the "Dastan"]]

Early storytelling probably originates in simple chants {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. People sang chants as they worked at grinding corn or sharpening tools. Our early ancestors created myths to explain natural occurrences. They assigned superhuman qualities to ordinary people, thus originating the hero tale.

Early storytelling combined stories, poetry, music, and dance. Those who excelled at storytelling became entertainers, educators, cultural advisors, and historians for the community. Through storytellers, the history of a culture was handed down from generation to generation.

The importance of stories and storytellers throughout human history can be seen in the respect afforded to professional storytellers.

The 9th century fictional storyteller [[Scheherazade]] of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', who saves herself from execution by telling tales, is one example  illustrating the value placed on storytelling in days of old. Centuries before Scheherazade, the power of storytelling is reflected by [[Vyasa]] at the beginning of the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. [[Vyasa]] says, "If you listen carefully, at the end you'll be someone else."

In the [[Middle Ages]] storytellers, also called a troubadour or a minstrel, could be seen in the market places and were honored as members of royal courts. [[Medieval]] storytellers were expected to know all the current tales and in the words of American storyteller [[Ruth Sawyer]], ‘to repeat all the noteworthy theses from the universities, to be well informed on court scandal, to know the healing power of herbs and simples (medicines), to be able to compose verses to a lord or lady at a moment's notice, and to play on at least two of the instruments then in favor at court.’ According to some writers there were 426 minstrels employed at the wedding of Princess Margaret of England in 1290. Two of the storytellers of the court of  [[King Edward I]] were two women who performed under the names of Matill Makejoye and Pearl in the Egg.

Journeying from land to land, storytellers would learn various regions's stories while also gathering news to bring back with them. Through exchanging stories with other storytellers, stories changed, making it difficult to trace the origins of many stories.

In the 1800s Jakob and Wilhelm [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]] collected and published stories that had been told orally in [[Germany]]. They did not publish them as they found them however, but edited them in accordance with their own values. Like the Grimm brothers in Germany, [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jorgen Moe]] collected [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] folk tales. In Denmark [[Hans Christian Andersen]] adapted folktales he heard from oral storytellers. In England, [[Joseph Jacobs]] recorded collections of folktales of [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]].

In the 1900s the importance of oral storytelling was recognised by storytellers such as [[Marie Shedlock]], a retired English schoolteacher. She made several tours to the [[United States]] to lecture on the art of storytelling emphasising the importance of storytelling as a natural way to introduce literature to children.

{{See also|Storytelling festival}}
In the 20th century oral storytelling has undergone a revival of interest and focus.  Including the establishment of a number of storytelling festivals beginning with the  [[National Storytelling Festival]] (USA) in [[Jonesborough, TN]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric Interview with Connie Regan-Blake on the Art of Storytelling with Brother Wolf Show A history of the National Storytelling Festival. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  

Regional storytelling festivals bring tellers of a certain state or region together for entertaining, telling and education in the art.

'''The painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School''' was the mainstream of the [[Bulgaria]]n fine arts between 13th and 14th centuries named after the capital and the main cultural center of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Although it was influenced by some tendencies of the [[Byzantine Art|Palaeogan Renaissance]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Tarnovo painting had its own unique features which makes it a separate artistic school.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Grabar|Grabar, A.]] La peinture religiouse en Bulgarie., Paris, 1928, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes mural decoration of churches, easel painting [[icon]]s, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. A few remains of [[mosaics]] have been found during archaeological excavation which shows that this technique was only rarely used in the Bulgarian Empire. The works of that school have some degree of realism, individualised portraits and psychological insight.&lt;ref&gt;Цончева, М. За Търновската живописна школа. - В: ''Търновска книйовна школа. 1371-1971'', С., 1974, с. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mural painting ==
[[Image:Church of SS. Peter and Paul, Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The interior of SS Peter and Pavel]]
For the first time in [[Eastern Europe]] the [[tempera]] method became widespread in the murals of the Tarnovo School of Art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Старобългарско изкуство", Том ІІ - Никола Мавродинов, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1959 г.&lt;/ref&gt; That technique allowed the work to proceed slower than the [[fresco]] method as well brighter and more saturated colouring and had potential for more additional colours. The fresco technique continued to be used, for instance in the beautiful frescoes of the [[Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo]] and the [[chapel]] of the Hrelyo Tower in the [[Rila Monastery]].

During the Second Empire the murals on the church walls closely encompassed every part of the surface: walls, vaults, columns, wall piers, arches, apses.&lt;ref&gt;"Старобългарско изкуство", Богдан Филов, издателство "Отечество", София, 1993 г.&lt;/ref&gt; Their positioning was in [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] layers according to the church [[Canon law|canon]].

[[Image:Kalojan desislava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''ktitors'' of the Boyana Church sevastokrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava.]]
On the first layer were depicted [[saint]]s who were usually stepped on a high painted plinth, which is one of the characteristic features of the School. Its lines imitated the panel plates of coloured [[marble]]. The selection of saints depended on the preferences of the ''[[ktitor]]s'' or on the general theme of the frescoes. Typical feature of the Tarnovo Artistic School are the numerous depictions of warrior-saints. For instance, in the [[Boyana Church]] there are ten warrior-saints. Widely spread was the image St [[Demetrius]] of Salonica, the patron saint of the [[Asen dynasty]], who was particularly popular in Bulgaria in 13th and 14th centuries. The ''ktitors'' were depicted in the narthex of the churches. Portraits of many noble [[Bulgarians]] from the [[Middle Ages]] have survived throughout the centuries due to that practice. In the Boyana  Church are preserved the images of Emperor [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh Asen]], his wife Irina, ''sebastokrator'' [[Kaloyan (sebastocrator)|Kaloyan]] and his wife Desislava.&lt;ref&gt;Дуйчев, И. Боянската църква в научната литература - В ''Българското средновековие, С., 1972, 478-512&lt;/ref&gt; There is a beautiful fresco of Emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] in the [[ossuary]] of the [[Bachkovo Monastery]] and in the church of Dolna Kamenitsa there are eleven images: [[Despotism|despot]] Michael (son of [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Shishman]]) his wife an unknown noble holding a model of the church; his wife and children and two clerics. Images of warrior saints and ktitors were common in the preserved detailed mural paintings on the foundations of the churches in Trapezitsa.&lt;ref&gt;Димов, В. Разкопките на Трапезица в град Търново. - ИБАД, 5, 1915, 112-176&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are featured with mild tones and a sense of realism in the rendered portraits and cloths. One of the churches in Trapeztisa was covered with mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Миятев, Кр. Мозайките от Трапезица - ИБАИ, 1, 1921/1922, с. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt; The palace church also had some mosaic decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Георгиева, С., Я. Николова и Н. Ангелов. Архитектурата на двореца, с. 57, обр. VII&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique and realistic portraits in the Boyana Church are considered to be forerunners of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The wall piers and the arches were often decorated with medallion-shaped bust images of saints. Magnificent examples of those can be observed in SS Peter and Paul Church in Tarnovo. Along with the traditional scenes such as "Christ's passions" and "Feast cycle" in the second layer; "Christ Pantokrator" in the dome and the Madonna with the infant [[Christ]] in the apse, there were also specific images and scenes. In the narthex of the  [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|SS. Forty Martyrs Church]] in Tarnovo there were frescoes of St Anna nursing the infant Mary and St Elisabeth nursing the infant John the Baptist, unfortunately the last one did not survive. The iconographic type ''Galaktotrophousa'' was a predecessor of the widely-spread images of Madonna with the infant Christ in [[Western Europe]]. Although it was canonical, that scene was rarely used in the Byzantine Iconography. In the 35 calendar scenes from the same church some of the characters were painted with contemporary garments. The large number of images of Jesus Christ in the Boyana Church makes an impression: ''Pantokrator'' (All-powerful); ''Emmanuel'' (Young man); ''Evergetes'' (Blessing); ''Mandilion''; ''Keramidion'' and the unique image ''Christ Ancient of Days'' in which He is depicted as a white-bearded Old man.
[[Image:Sv ubrus 1259.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Christ Urbus, Boyana Church near Sofia.]]
Thеre are original themes in the Transfiguration of God Chapel in the Hrelyo Tower situated in the Rila Monastery. In the dome is depicted the composition ''Sophia-Great Wisdom of God'' and in the narthex ''Psalms of David''. The scenes ''Musicians'' and ''[[Horo (dance)|Horo]]'' are especially interesting because they represent the cloths and the way of living of the Bulgarians during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Прашков, Л. Хрельовата кула. С., 1973&lt;/ref&gt; There are scenes of [[Saint Ivan of Rila]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Прашков, Л. Един стенописен цикъл от житието на Свети Иван Пилски от XIV век. - В: ''Търновската книжовна школа''. 1371-1971, С., 1974, с. 429-442&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are relatively few preserved monuments of the Tarnovo School of Painting, they refute the popular opinion that the religious murals are inveterate and that they are inappropriate for artistic imagination.

The archaeological research shows that some public edifices and the palaces were also richly decorated with mural paintings&lt;ref&gt;"Царстващият град Търновград. Археологически проучвания.", съставители Атанас Попов и Йордан Алексиев, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1985 г.&lt;/ref&gt; but unfortunately the few remaining fragments are not enough for the themes to be determined. The fragments of richly dressed men were discovered in the throne hall&lt;ref&gt;Георгиева, С., Я. Николова и Н. Ангелов. Архитектурата на двореца, с. 58, обр. VII&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that probably the hall was decorated with the depictions of the Bulgarian Emperors and Empresses.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[Image:Tomic Psalter.JPG|right|thumb|Page from the [[Tomić Psalter]] (1360)]]
The most famous manuscripts are the [[Sofia Psalter]], 1337, [[Tomić Psalter]], c 1360, and the [[Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander]], 1355&amp;ndash;1356, now in Sofia, Moscow and London respectively.  All are heavily illuminated.

== Icons ==

The Tarnovo school continued and enriched the traditions and icon design of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Some notable icons include ''St Eleusa'' (13th century) from [[Nessebar]] which is currently kept in the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevski Cathedral]] in [[Sofia]] and ''St John of Rila'' (14th century) kept in the Rila Monastery. Like the Boyana Church frescoes in the second one there is realism and non-canonical design. Another feature of the school's iconography were the large icons which were made to fascinate the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Härtel/Schönfeld: Kulturelle Blüte - die Schule von Tarnovo in Bulgarien S.64-67&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such icon is the Poganovo icon in the cathedral of Sofia depicting St Mary with John the Baptist which was produced in 1395. It is double-sided and with a size of 93x61 cm.

The icons were produced with varied material. The famous ceramics icon from the Preslav School during the First Empire remained relatively popular during 13th century. Icons for domestic use were usually 30x35 cm while those in the church altar could reach very large sizes. Bulgarian icon painting declined after the Ottoman conquest of the country but those traditions were continued during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]].

[[Image:OC-Performing-Arts-Center.jpg|thumb|right| Segerstrom Concert Hall of the Segerstrom Center for the Arts]]
'''Performing arts center/centre''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]), often abbreviated as PAC, is used to refer to: 

* A multi-use performance space that is intended for use by various types of the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]]. 

:The intended multiple use of performing arts centers in this sense differentiates them from single-purpose [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], [[opera house]]s or [[theater (structure)|theatres]], although the actual use of single-purpose spaces for other than their intended use is widespread. This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman [[Colosseum]] and Greek amphitheatres.

* A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as [[orchestra|symphonic music]] or [[chamber music]] or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole. The modern version of this came into being only in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Steven A.|title=The evolution of the performing arts center|url=http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|publisher=AMS Planning &amp; Research Corp|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=October 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114201139/http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:Examples of this type of PAC are the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Sydney Opera House]], and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York City.

Some performing arts center organizations act as sole presenter for events using the venues within the center, but most also frequently rent their performance spaces to other [[performing arts presenters]] or self-presenting performing arts groups. Examples of this practice is the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] renting venues in Boston's [[Boch Center]].

New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses. PACs became a draw for touring shows and eventually included visual art in their facilities. Today, these centers are valuable civic resources that provide education, access, exchange of creative discourse, opportunities for cultural expression and awareness.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">[[Image:production sound mixer.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Sound mixer at work.]]A '''production sound mixer''', '''location sound recordist''', '''location sound engineer''' or simply '''sound mixer''' is the member of a [[film crew]] or [[television crew]] responsible for recording all [[sound recording]] on set during the [[filmmaking]] or [[television production]] using [[professional audio]] equipment, for later inclusion in the finished product, or for reference to be used by the [[sound designer]], sound effects editors, or [[foley artist]]s.  This requires choice and deployment of [[microphones]], choice of recording media, and mixing of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] signals in real time.

[[File:Sound technician with mixer, boom, slate and multiple wireless mic transmitters and receivers.jpg|thumb|Sound technician with mixer, boom, slate and multiple wireless mic transmitters and receivers at San Diego Comic Con 2011]]Usually, the recordist will arrive on location with his/her own [[Audio equipment|equipment]], which normally includes [[microphones]], radio systems, booms, mixing desk, [[audio storage]], [[headphones]], cables, tools, and a paper or computer sound logs.  The recordist may be asked to capture a wide variety of wild sound on location, and must also consider the format of the finished product ([[monaural|mono]], [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] or multi channels). The recorded production [[sound track]] is later combined with other elements, i.e. effects, music, narration, foley or re-recorded dialog by [[automatic dialogue replacement]] (ADR).

Often, when taping on [[video]], the sound recordist may record (single system) audio directly onto the camera rather than use a separate medium (double system), although a separate copy is often made, as it both provides an extra copy which may have more tracks and also may include other sound captured without the camera.

The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound including the hiring of a [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]] and [[utility sound technician]], planning the technical setup involving sound including both sound equipment and ancillary devices involved in syncing and time offsets, anticipating and discussing sound-related problems with the rest of the crew, and ordering and preparing the sound equipment to be used on the set.

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
| year      = 2003
| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich

== Acquiring sophistication ==

Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include:

* educational travel – note the function of the traditional [[Grand Tour]] for European aesthetes&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On a societal level commentators can associate various forms of sophistication with [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}

'''''The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories''''', sometimes shortened to '''''The Book of Virtues''''' ({{ISBN|0-684-83577-0}}), is an anthology edited by [[William Bennett]]. It was published on November 1, 1993 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and was followed by ''The Moral Compass: Stories for a Life's Journey'', in late 1995.

The book is intended for the moral education of the young and is divided into different virtues: [[self-discipline]], [[compassion]], [[moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[friendship]], [[employment|work]], [[courage]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]], [[honesty]], [[loyalty]], and [[faith]].

A spinoff for young audiences called ''The Children's Book of Virtues'' also came out in 1995. A year later, it served as the basis for a [[PBS Kids]] [[Adventures from the Book of Virtues|TV series]].

Bennett had served as [[Secretary of Education]] for President [[Ronald Reagan]] and often made school trips during his tenure. According to Bennett, the ''Book of Virtues'' grew out of conversations with teachers, who expressed difficulty in communicating common moral principles to diverse student bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/bill-bennett/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chess Players''''' is an 1876 [[genre painting]] by [[Thomas Eakins]], [[List of works by Thomas Eakins|Goodrich catalogue #96]]. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Description==
It is a small oil on wood panel depicting Eakins' father Benjamin observing a [[chess]] match. The two players are Bertrand Gardel (at left), an elderly French teacher, and the somewhat younger George Holmes, a painter.  The men are in a dark, wood-panelled Victorian parlour with a quality of light suggesting late afternoon. The game is well in progress, as many pieces have been removed from the board. Holmes, the younger player, seems to be winning the match, as he has taken the [[queen (chess)|queen]] of his opponent (the top of which pokes out of the table's drawer), and his own black queen is well-positioned in the centre of the board. Eakins painted ''The Chess Players'' for his father, and signed the painting in Latin, "BENJAMINI. EAKINS. FILIUS. PINXIT. '76"—"the son of Benjamin Eakins painted this"—in small letters on the drawer of the table. 

Art historian Akela Reason proposes that the painting is a tribute to a number of the artist's father-figures: Holmes probably was Eakins's first art teacher; Gardel was his French teacher; Benjamin Eakins was his literal father; and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], his master at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], is represented by a print of ''Ave Caesar Morituri te Salutant'', over the clock.&lt;ref&gt;Akela Reason, ''Beyond Realism: History in the Art of Thomas Eakins'' (dissertation, University of Maryland, 2005), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Martin Berger has analyzed the content of the painting in detail, finding it an evocation of the passage of time and ascribing it a highly personal meaning in Eakins' life. The younger chess player's attempt to kill the older player's [[king (chess)|king]] is analogous to the [[Oedipal complex]]. In the way that his father Benjamin is placed in opposition to Eakins the painter, the two may be envisioned as playing out a psychological "conflict" across the other axis of the chess board. In this light it is not coincidental that the painting was made on wood panel rather than canvas. While Eakins has humbled himself before his father in signing the painting only by reference to being Benjamin's son, he also presents his father ambivalently. Elevating his father's status, he places Benjamin centrally, with the [[vanishing point]] behind Benjamin's head. Yet Eakins has obscured his father's face by shadow and by the angle at which he looks down upon the game. Although the painting was dedicated to Benjamin, the title "The Chess Players" curiously leaves Eakins' father out of the narrative of the picture.

'''''The Vortices of Wrath (Lebanon 1977)''''' is a [[triptych]] painted by [[Nabil Kanso]] in 1977. It is part of the ''Lebanon'' series began in 1975 in response to the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The triptych is done in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] measuring 3×7.60 meters (10×25 feet). The center is 3×3 meters (10×10 feet) and each side 2.75×2.30 meters (9×7.5 feet).&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life Paintings 1974-1994'', pp. 32–33, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The triptych reflects aggressive use of brushstrokes and intense rendering of relationships of color, form and structure in conveying the atmosphere and mood of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Ildebrando, ''The Art of Nabil Kanso'', Panorama, Maracaibo, April 10, 1985,  [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/rossi.html article]&lt;/ref&gt;  Menacing and terrified figures seem to “burst out of the canvas to reveal the inner realities of war”.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: ''Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], April 26, Caracas, 1987, [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/erminy.html text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The central painting focuses a [[Hindu goddess|goddess-like figure]] with multiple sets of arms and legs suspended in chains and barbed wire. Thick black lines dominate Kanso's work and the presence of chains and barbed wire are common as well.&lt;ref&gt;Seaberg, Steve. ''An Artists's Response'', Art Papers (1985). Nabil Kanso: Artworks, 	Life, Critical Essays, Videos. Nabil Kanso. Web. 12 Apr. 2012 [http://www.nabilkanso.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess figure is pulled apart by demons who appear hungry and bloodthirsty. These villainous figures resemble zombies, but not like Russo and Romero's portrayal in their 1990 film ''[[Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)|Night of the Living Dead]]'' where a mindless force compels corpses to feed like mindless puppets.  Rather, these zombies appear malicious and precise with their tortures.&lt;ref&gt;Kanso, Nabil. ''Lebanon Vortices of Wrath'' 1977. Oil on canvas. Nabilkanso.com Nabil Kanso. Web. 12 Apr. 2012.

An infant's head, wailing in sadness, serves as a backdrop, constantly reminding us of the loss of Lebanon's youth.&lt;ref&gt;Seaberg, Steve: ''An Artists's Response'' [[Art Papers]], p.51, November 1985 [http://nabilkanso.org/seaberg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''Artworks, Life, Critical Essays, Videos''. Nabil Kanso. Web. 12 Apr. 2012 [http://www.nabilkanso.org]&lt;/ref&gt; A demonic figure reminiscent of [[St. Michael the Archangel]] floats above the victim, stabbing it with a long spear. The victim mirrors his assailant, yellow, gaunt, and sporting an identical weapon. Below the jaundiced loser of the battle is a child, weeping and shielding itself from the vision.&lt;ref&gt;Kanso, Nabil. ''Lebanon Vortices of Wrath'', 1977. Oil on canvas. Nabilkanso.com. Nabil Kanso. Web. 12 Apr. 2012. [http://nabilkanso.com/LEBANON.html Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt; In one sense of the scene, we witness brother fighting against brother. They could be twins.

The concept of travesties committed against families as their homes were razed (and experience Kanso understood first-hand)&lt;ref&gt;Kanso, Nabil.

The hope for the future of a war-torn country is devoured in the form of a central figure dangling an infant and a child above a ritualistic circle of flames and dancing bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18306">[[File:Traditional dogon masque.jpg|thumb|[[Dogon people|Dogon]] ceremonial mask in use]]
Ritual and ceremonial [[mask]]s are an essential feature of the traditional culture of the peoples of a part of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], e.g. roughly between the Sahara and the [[Kalahari Desert]]. While the specific implications associated  to ritual masks widely vary in different cultures, some traits are common to most [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]]. For instance, masks usually have a spiritual and religious meaning and they are used in ritual dances and social and religious events, and a special status is attributed to the artists that create masks to those that wear them in ceremonies. In most cases, mask-making is an art that is passed on from father to son, along with the knowledge of the symbolic meanings conveyed by such masks. African masks come in all different [[colours]], such as red, black, orange, and brown. 
[[File:African countries where masks are used.jpg|left|thumb|African countries where masks are used traditionally]]
'''Traditional African masks''' are one of the elements of great African art that have most evidently influenced [[Europe]] and [[Western art]] in general; in the 20th century, artistic movements such as [[cubism]], [[fauvism]] and [[expressionism]] have often taken inspiration from vast and diverse heritage of African masks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsnap.org/category/fauvism/ Fauvism] at Art Snap&lt;/ref&gt; Influences of this heritage can also be found in other traditions such as [[South America|South-]] and [[Central America]]n masked [[Carnival]] parades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawfurd.dk/africa/carnival.htm A Short History of Carnival with a Touch of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Fang Ngil Berlin IIIC6000.jpg|thumb|Ngil mask from [[Gabon]] or [[Cameroon]]; wood colored with kaolin (chiny clay); by [[Fang people]]; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany). Worn with full costume in a night masquerade to settle disputes and quell misbehavior, this calm visage was terrifying to wrong-doers]]

In most traditional African cultures, the person who wears a ritual mask conceptually loses his or her human life and turns into the spirit represented by the mask itself( it is sad).&lt;ref&gt;This idea has been literally portrayed in the well-known novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by [[Nigeria]]n writer [[Chinua Achebe]]. While the author hints at  the same novel, masked elders are particularly hostile towards the missionaries, a symbolical representation of the opposition of traditional Nigerian culture (as represented by the mask-spirits) and the new values brought along by European Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation of the mask wearer into a spirit usually relies on other practices, such as specific types of music and dance, or ritual costumes that contribute to conceal the mask-wearer's human identity. The mask wearer thus becomes a sort of [[Mediumship|medium]] that allows for a dialogue between the community and the spirits (usually [[veneration of the dead|those of the dead]] or nature-related spirits). Masked dances are a part of most traditional African ceremonies related to [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[initiation rite]]s, and so on. Some of the most complex rituals that have been studied by scholars are found in Nigerian cultures such as those of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Edo people|Edo]] peoples, that bear some resemblances to the Western notion of [[theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Analogies between Nigerian ceremonies and the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]] (as well as the Western theatre in general) have been developed by the [[Nobel Prize]] winning Nigerian writer [[Wole Soyinka]]. Soyinka wrote [[drama]]s based on the Yoruba traditions and, conversely, he has "africanized" classical works of the Western theatre such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' or [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 


Since every mask has a specific spiritual meaning, most traditions comprise several different traditional masks. The traditional religion of the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], for example, comprises three main cults (the ''Awa'' or cult of the dead, the ''Bini'' or cult of the communication with the spirits, and the ''Lebe'' or cult of nature); each of these has its pantheon of spirits, corresponding to 78 different types of masks overall. It is often the case that the artistic quality and complexity of a mask reflects the relative importance of the portrayed spirit in the systems of beliefs of a particular people; for example, simpler masks such as the ''kple kple'' of the [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] people of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] (essentially a circle with minimal eyes, mouth and horns) are associated to minor spirits.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;

==Subject and style==
African masks are usually shaped after a human face or some animal's [[Snout|muzzle]], albeit rendered in a sometimes highly abstract form. The inherent lack of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in African masks (and African art in general) is justified by the fact that most African cultures clearly distinguish the essence of a subject from its looks, the former, rather than the latter, being the actual subject of artistical representation. An extreme example is given by ''nwantantay'' masks of the [[Bwa people]] ([[Burkina Faso]]) that represent the flying spirits of the forest; since these spirits are deemed to be invisible, the corresponding masks are shaped after abstract, purely geometrical forms.
[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]
[[File:Makurian dancing mask.jpg|thumb|160px|Zoomorphic mask as depicted on a [[Makuria]]n mural from [[Old Dongola]] (12th/13th century)]]
Stylish elements in a mask's looks are codified by the tradition and may either identify a specific community or convey specific meanings. For example, both the Bwa and the [[Buna people]] of Burkina Faso have [[hawk]] masks, with the shape of the beak identifying a mask as either Bwa or Buna. In both cases, the hawk's wings are decorated with geometric patterns that have moral meanings; saw-shaped lines represent the hard path followed by ancestors, while chequered patterns represent the interaction of opposites (male-female, night-day, and so on)&lt;ref name="Essortment"&gt;See ''African Masks Symbolism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Traits representing moral values are found in many cultures. Masks from the [[Senufo people]] of [[Ivory Coast]], for example, have their eyes half closed, symbolizing a peaceful attitude, self-control, and patience. In [[Sierra Leone]] and elsewhere, small eyes and mouth represent [[humility]], and a wide, protruding forehead represents wisdom. In Gabon, large chins and mouths represent authority and strength.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt; The [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] of the Ivory Coast carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the straight nose to represent unwillingness to retreat.&lt;ref name="Essortment"/&gt;

===Animals===
[[File:Ngond masque.jpg|thumb|A mask of the [[Mitsogo]] people of Gabon]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 60.144 Mask Wabele or Wo.jpg|thumb|right|Wabele mask, Senufo people, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Animals are common subjects in African masks. Animal masks might actually represent the spirit of animals, so that the mask-wearer becomes a medium to speak to animals themselves (e.g. to ask wild beasts to stay away from the village); in many cases, nevertheless, an animal is also (sometimes mainly) a symbol of specific virtues. Common animal subjects include the [[African buffalo|buffalo]] (usually representing strength, as in the Baoulé culture),&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks&gt;See ''African Masks''&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocodile]], hawk, [[hyena]], [[warthog]] and [[antelope]]. Antelopes have a fundamental role in many cultures of the Mali area (for example in Dogon and [[Bambara people|Bambara]] culture) as representatives of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Many agricultural societies and associations in Mali have a stylized representation of an antelope in their symbols.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogon antelope masks are highly abstract, with a general rectangular shape and many horns (a representation of abundant harvest. Bambara antelope masks (called ''chiwara'') have long horns representing the thriving growth of [[millet]], [[legs]] (representing roots), long ears (representing the songs sung by the working women at harvest time), and a saw-shaped line that represents the path followed by the Sun between [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; A 12th/13th century mural from [[Old Dongola]], the capital of the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]], depicts dancing masks decorated with [[cowrie]] shells imitating some animal with long snouts and big ears.{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2008|p=120}}

A common variation on the animal-mask theme is the composition of several distinct animal traits in a single mask, sometimes along with human traits. Merging distinct animal traits together is sometimes a means to represent unusual, exceptional virtue or high status. For example, the Poro [[secret society|secret societies]] of the [[Senufo people]] of the Ivory Coast have masks that celebrate the exceptional power of the society by merging three different "danger" symbols: antelope horns, crocodile teeth, and warthog fangs.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;See ''Icons of Power''&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is that of ''kifwebe'' masks of the [[Songye people]] ([[Congo basin]]), that mix the stripes of a [[zebra]] (or [[okapi]]), the teeth of a [[crocodile]], the eyes of a [[chameleon]], the mouth of an [[aardvark]], the crest of a rooster, the feathers of an [[owl]] and more.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt;

===Feminine beauty===
[[File:Bete mask p1070041.jpg|thumb|Doei (or Kwere), female ancestor mask, [[Tanzania]]|left]]
Another common subject of African masks is a woman's face, usually based on a specific culture's [[ideal of feminine beauty]]. Female masks of the [[Punu people]] of Gabon, for example, have long curved eyelashes, almond-shaped eyes, thin chin, and traditional ornaments on their cheeks, as all these are considered good-looking traits.&lt;ref name=Virginia&gt;See ''Faces of the Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine masks of the [[Baga people]] have [[Scarification|ornamental scars]] and breasts. In many cases, wearing masks that represent feminine beauty is strictly reserved to men.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt;

One of the well-known representations of female beauty is the ''[[Idia]]'' mask of [[Benin]]. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See Bortolot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestors masks (masks of the dead)===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1582 Mwaash aMbooy Mask.jpg|thumb|right|Mwaash aMbooy Mask [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
As the [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of defunct ancestors]] is a fundamental element of most African traditional cultures, it is not surprising that the dead is also a common subject for masks. Masks referring to dead ancestors are most often shaped after a [[human skull]]. A well-known example is the ''mwana pwo'' (literally, "young woman") of the [[Chokwe people]] ([[Angola]]), that mixes elements referring to feminine beauty (well-proportioned oval face, small nose and chin) and other referring to death (sunken eye sockets, cracked skin, and tears); it represents a female ancestor who died young, venerated in rites such as [[circumcision]] rites and ceremonies associated to the renewal of life.&lt;ref&gt;A male variant of this mask is called ''cihongo''.&lt;/ref&gt; As veneration of the dead is most often associated to fertility and reproduction, many dead-ancestor masks also have sexual symbols; the ''ndeemba'' mask of the [[Yaka people]] (Angola and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]), for example, is shaped after a skull complemented with a phallic-shaped nose.&lt;ref name=Virginia2&gt;See ''Images of Ancestors''&lt;/ref&gt;

A special class of ancestor masks are those related to notable, historical or legendary people. The ''mwaash ambooy'' mask of the [[Kuba people]] (DR Congo), for example, representing  the legendary founder of the [[Kuba Kingdom]], Woot, while the ''mgady amwaash'' mask represents his wife Mweel.&lt;ref name=Rulers&gt;See ''Portraits of Rulers''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and structure==

The most commonly used material for masks is wood, although a wide variety of other elements can be used, including light stone such as [[steatite]], metals such as [[copper]] or [[bronze]], different types of [[fabric]], [[pottery]], and more. Some masks are painted (for example using [[ochre]] or other natural colorants). A wide array of ornamental items can be applied to the mask surface; example include animal [[hair]], horns, or teeth, [[sea shell]]s, [[seed]]s, straws, egg shell, and feathers. For example, animal hair or straws are often used for a mask's hair or beard.

The general structure of a mask varies depending on the way it is intended to be worn. The most common type applies to the wearer's face, like most Western (e.g., carnival) masks. Others are worn like hats on the top of the wearer's head; examples include those of the Ekhoi people of Nigeria and Bwa people of Burkina Faso, as well as the famous ''chiwara'' masks of the Bambara people.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; Some masks (for example those of the [[Sande society]] of [[Liberia]] and the [[Mende people]] of Sierra Leone, that are made from hollow tree stumps) are worn like helmets covering both the head and face. Some African cultures have mask-like ornaments that are worn on the chest rather than the head of face; this includes those used by the [[Makonde people]] of [[East Africa]] in ''ndimu'' ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Rebirth&gt;See ''Physical characteristics of African Tribal Masks''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercially-produced masks==
[[File:Commercial masks mwenge.jpg|thumb|Commercial masks for sale a in a shop in the [[Mwenge]] Makonde market, [[Dar es Salaam]]|left]]
As African masks are largely appreciated by Europeans, they are widely commercialized and sold in most tourist-oriented markets and shops in Africa (as well as "ethnic" shops in the [[Western World]]). As a consequence, the traditional art of mask-making has gradually ceased to be a privileged, status-related practice, and mass production of masks has become widespread. While, in most cases, commercial masks are (more or less faithful) reproductions of traditional masks, this connection is weakening over time, as the logics of mass-production make it harder to identify the actual geographical and cultural origins of the masks found in such venues as curio shops and tourist markets. For example, the [[Okahandja]] market in [[Namibia]] mostly sells masks that are produced in [[Zimbabwe]] (as they are cheaper and more easily available than local masks), and, in turn, Zimbabwean mask-makers reproduce masks from virtually everywhere in Africa rather than from their own local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Namibia'', [[Lonely Planet]] 2007, {{ISBN|978-88-6040-119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{RomanMilitary}}
The '''Tropaeum Traiani''' is a monument in Roman [[Civitas Tropaensium]] (site of modern [[Adamclisi]], [[Romania]]), built in 109 in then [[Moesia Inferior]], to commemorate [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]]'s victory over the [[Dacians]], in the winter of 101-102, in the [[Battle of Adamclisi]]. Before Trajan's construction, an [[altar]] existed there, on the walls of which were inscribed the names of the 3,000 [[legionaries]] and [[auxilia]] (servicemen) who had died "fighting for the Republic". (Latin: Tropaeum from Greek: [[Tropaion]], source of English: "[[trophy]]").

Trajan's monument was inspired by the [[Mausoleum of Augustus|Augustus mausoleum]], and was dedicated to the god [[Mars Ultor]] in AD 107/108 .
On the monument there were 54 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] depicting Roman legions fighting against enemies; most of these metopes are preserved in the museum nearby. The monument was supposed to be a warning to the tribes outside this newly conquered province.&lt;ref&gt;F.B Florescu Das Siegesdenksmal von Adamclisi: Tropaeum Traiani (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 20th century, the monument was reduced to a mound of stone and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], with a large number of the original bas-reliefs scattered around. The present edifice is a reconstruction dating from 1977. The nearby museum contains many archaeological objects, including parts of the original Roman monument. Of the original 54 metopes, 48 are in the museum and 1 is in Istanbul.

==Trophy==
The monument was dedicated with a large inscription to Mars Ultor (the avenger). The inscription has been preserved fragmentarily from two sides of the trophy hexagon, and has been reconstructed as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MARTI ULTOR[I]&lt;br&gt;
IM[P(erator)CAES]AR DIVI&lt;br&gt;
NERVA[E] F(ILIUS) N[E]RVA&lt;br&gt;
TRA]IANUS [AUG(USTUS) GERM(ANICUS)]&lt;br&gt;
DAC]I[CU]S PONT(IFEX) MAX(IMUS)&lt;br&gt;
TRIB(UNICIA) POTEST(ATE) XIII&lt;br&gt;
IMP(ERATOR) VI CO(N)S(UL) V P(ater) P(atriae)&lt;br&gt;
?VICTO EXERC]ITU D[ACORUM]&lt;br&gt;
?---- ET SARMATA]RUM&lt;br&gt;
 ----]E 31.&lt;ref name="cimec.ro"&gt;http://cimec.ro/Arheologie/tropaeum/introen/body.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inscription, which calls Trajan ''Germanicus'' from previous his victories in Germany and ''Dacicus'' for his new conquest of Dacia, can be translated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To [[Mars_(mythology)#Mars_Ultor|Mars Ultor]], &lt;br&gt;
Caesar the emperor, son of the [[Nerva|divine Nerva]], &lt;br&gt;
Nerva Trajan Augustus, ''Germanicus'', &lt;br&gt;
''Dacicus'', ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', &lt;br&gt;
[[Plebeian tribune]] for the 13th time, &lt;br&gt;
[proclaimed] Emperor [by the army] for the 6th time, &lt;br&gt;
Consul for the 5th time, [[Pater Patriae|Father the Fatherland]], &lt;br&gt;
Conquered the Dacian and the Sarmatian armies ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Metopes===
On the monument was a frieze comprising 54 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]. 48 metopes are hosted in the Adamclisi museum nearby, and one metope is hosted by Istanbul Archaeology Museum, the rest having been lost (There is a reference from  [[Constantin C. Giurescu|Giurescu]] that two of them fell into [[Danube]] River during the transport to Bucharest).&lt;ref&gt;http://romaniancoins.org/10lei09_adamclisi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological research==
In 1837, four [[Prussia]]n officers, hired by the Ottoman Empire to study the Dobruja strategic situation, performed the first excavations. The team was composed by Heinrich Muhlbach, leading Friedrich Leopold Fischer, Carol Wincke-Olbendorf and [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]]. They tried to reach the center of the monument by digging an underground tunnel, nothing was found after the digging.&lt;ref name="Barbu"&gt;Vasile Barbu, Cristian Schuster Grigore G. Tocilescu si "Cestiunea Adamclisi" Pagini din Istoria Arheologiei Romanesti {{ISBN|7-379-25580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was also visited by C. W. Wutzer from Bonn University, who recorded a short description of the monument and of some local legends.&lt;ref name="Barbu" /&gt;

The monument was researched by Grigore Tocilescu, O. Benford and G. Niemann, between 1882–1895,&lt;ref&gt;Cimec http://www.cimec.ro/scripts/muzee/id.asp?k=246&lt;/ref&gt; George Murnu in 1909, Vasile Parvan stop the researches in 1911, Paul Nicorescu studied the site between 1935–1945, Gheorghe Stefan and Ioan Barnea in 1945. From 1968 the site was researched under Romanian Academy supervision.

The '''Tyrone Guthrie Centre''' is a centre for creative artists at Annaghmakerrig, [[Newbliss]], [[County Monaghan]], [[Ireland]], founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradburn|first1=Richard|title=Writers’ retreats: the perfect place to make progress|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/writers-retreats-the-perfect-place-to-make-progress-1.2798519|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=Irish Times|date=20 September 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was the family home of theatrical director [[Sir Tyrone Guthrie]], and he bequeathed it to the Irish nation to be used as a retreat. His will read that he would leave: 

: ''...my said dwelling-house, furniture, pictures and chattels and the income of my residuary estate to be used for the purpose of providing a retreat for artists and other like persons ... so as to enable them to do or facilitate them in doing creative work.''

The house has since hosted people such as [[Michael Harding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=Michael|title=The artist as terrorist is a dying species|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/michael-harding-the-artist-as-terrorist-is-a-dying-species-1.2408638|website=Irish Times|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Loreena Mckennitt]], Oonagh Kearney, [[Derval Symes]], Page Allen, Rory Pierce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Composing in the wilderness - Rory Pierce's musical journey|url=https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1220/840192-composing-in-the-wilderness-rory-pierces-musical-journey/|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=RTE|date=19 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Roisin Meaney, [[Anne Rigney]], Gemma Browne, [[Colette Bryce]], [[Phil Coulter]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]], [[Mary Dorcey]], [[Nuala Ní Chonchúir]] and [[Peter McCann]].

International authors have also completed residencies at the Centre, assisting them to complete or polish existing writing projects, going on to great success. These have included Australian authors [[Luke Davies]] and Linda Jaivin and British author [[Bella Pollen]].

The first Director was Bernard Loughlin [1981-1999], succeeded by Regina Doyle Acting DIrector (1999 - 2001) Sheila Pratschke [2001 2007], Pat Donlon [2007-2010] and now Robbie McDonald [since 2010].

The centre is a residential workplace open to professional practitioners in all art forms. Creative residencies (or artistic retreats ) are for maximum periods of three months in the Big House and six months in the Farmyard Cottages.

In a tranquil, beautiful setting amid the lakes and drumlins of County Monaghan, everything the eye can see is private in the gated {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} fully wooded estate. In the 'Big House' (as it is affectionately known) everything is provided for, including delicious food much of which comes from their own organic gardens. The dinner each evening at 7 is always a buzz of chat and discussion that is a welcome interruption to the strong creative work vibe that surrounds the centre. Each bedroom includes, writing desk and a chair and has its own charm and character with a selection of books, paintings and a view. Ten of the rooms have en-suite bathrooms and most have fireplaces. Linen and towels are provided.

Up to seven can stay in the 5 self-catering cottages all of which have a small easily lit stove to supplement the comfort and warmth. Eight well light warm studio spaces are also available along with a performance/dance space opened in 2006.

'''Vicky Brago-Mitchell''' is an American [[fractal]] [[artist]] known in the 1960s as a [[Stanford University]] student who, while working as a [[topless dancer]],{{citation-needed|date=August 2015}} ran for student body president.  She won the preliminary election, but lost to eventual [[Earth Day]] national coordinator [[Denis Hayes]] in a two-person runoff election.  She was born on September 30, 1946 in [[Yakima, Washington]].  Daughter of a [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], she grew up as Victoria Jane Bowles in small towns in Washington, [[Oregon]] and [[Montana]]. After graduating from high school she attended Stanford University as a scholarship student majoring in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In 1967 she was the first American college girl to appear nude in a campus [[magazine]], the Stanford Chaparral  (''Stanford Chaparral'', Spring 1967). In 1968 she began working at night as a topless dancer under the stage name Vicky Drake, and ran for student body president with a campaign poster that was a photo of herself posing nude on the Stanford Mausoleum (''Stanford Alumni Magazine'', September/October 1994). This story was first reported by the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], May 1, 1968, then carried by [[wire services]] [[Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] and published in [[newspapers]] worldwide. A feature about her titled Student Body appeared in the September 1968 edition of [[Playboy]] and was reprinted in the 1971 Playboy special edition The Youth Culture.

From 1970 to 1974 she toured the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] as a [[stripper]],{{citation-needed|date=August 2015}} then stayed in Japan for two years, working as a [[translator]], [[photographer]] and [[English language|English]] [[teacher]]. In 1977 she obtained a teaching credential from [[California State University, Fullerton]], then worked as an elementary school teacher until 2005.

In 2002, she produced a [[CD]] of her husband [[composer]] [[John Mitchell (composer)|John Mitchell]]’s [[chamber music]] for [[string instruments]], recorded in [[Moscow]], and in 2006 arranged the production of a double CD of his chamber music for [[woodwind instruments]] by MMC Recordings in [[Boston]], featuring [[clarinetist]] [[Richard Stoltzman]]. In 2005 her [[fractal art]] appeared on the cover of Latin Finance [[magazine]] and was shown at the  Biennale Internazionale dell’Arte Contemporanea in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

The '''Wenlok jug''' or '''Wenlock jug''' is a rare surviving example of an English bronze jug from the 15th century, with great significance for the study of bronze working in medieval England.  Only two similar jugs are known in the UK.  The Wenlok jug is the smallest of the three, but bears the earliest maker's mark for the English founder - possibly a bell founder - who cast it.  The other examples are the [[Asante Ewer]], which retains its lid and is held by the [[British Museum]] having been found at Kumai in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] in 1896 during the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]], and the [[Robinson jug]], which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].  All bear inscriptions in English and were made from [[leaded bronze]], an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar decorative motifs.

The Wenlok jug stands {{convert|31.5|cm}} high and weighs {{convert|6.1|kg}}.  It is decorated with the words "My Lord Wenlok", and several heraldic emblems, including the [[Royal Arms of England]] used from 1340 to 1405, and the [[Three Crowns|three crowns]] of [[East Anglia]] associated  with [[Edmund the Martyr|St Edmund]] (who was [[King of East Anglia]]) and  [[St Etheldreda]].  Hinges indicate a lid was once present, but it is now missing.  It is thought to have been made for [[William Wenlock]] (d. 1391), Canon of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] from 1362, [[Archdeacon of Rochester]] from 1376, and Canon of the [[King's Chapel, Westminster]] in 1381, who is buried at [[St Mary's Church, Luton]], or his great-nephew [[John Wenlock, 1st Baron Wenlock]], whose brick-built manor house [[Someries Castle]] is near Luton.

By 1831 it was in the collection of [[Thomas William Fermor, 4th Earl of Pomfret]], possibly acquired by antiquarian [[Henrietta Louisa Fermor]].

The jug was sold by [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]] at [[Sotheby's]] in 2005 along with other articles from [[Easton Neston house|Easton Neston]] in Northamptonshire.  It reached £568,000, six times the top auctioneer's estimate of £60,000 to £80,000.  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York tried to buy the jug from the buyer, but a temporary export ban in October 2005 allowed [[Luton Museum]] to raise £750,000 to match the price and acquire it instead, funded by £137,500 from the [[National Art Collections Fund]], £500,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], and donations from the Headley Trust, the Pilgrim Trust, the [[Worshipful Company of Founders]], the Friends of Luton Museums, and others.

The jug was displayed in Luton at [[Wardown Park Museum]] and then at the Stockwood Discovery Centre in [[Stockwood Park]].  It was stolen from a high-security cabinet at Stockwood Discovery Centre on 12 May 2012.  After appearing on the BBC's ''[[Crimewatch]]'' programme, the jug was recovered in [[Tadworth]], Surrey in September 2012.

It has also been suggested&lt;ref&gt;FRAY,Adrian F.; The Mystery of Lord Wenlock and His Glastonbury Treasure; Austen Macauley 2016; {{ISBN|978-1785544729}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that all three ewers were made in, or near, [[Bruges]] during the first week of July 1468, and given by the [[Charles the Bold]], Count of Burgundy, to the travelling companions of his bride, [[Margaret of York]] (King [[Edward IV]]'s sister). Her companions were Sir Anthony Woodville (Asante Ewer), the Duchess of Norfolk (the Robinson Jug), and Lord John Wenlock (the Wenlock Jug). The English texts were devised by the new countess, and the out-of-date coat of arms were in the household of the count's aunt, who had married the Duke of Bedford in 1423. The three jugs/ewers would therefore be examples of mid-fifteenth century Burgundian workmanship.
