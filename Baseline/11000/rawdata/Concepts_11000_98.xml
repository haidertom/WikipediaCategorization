The '''AD–AS''' or '''aggregate demand–aggregate supply model''' is a [[macroeconomic model]] that explains [[price level]] and [[output (economics)|output]] through the relationship of [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]].

It is based on the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] presented in his work ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''. It is one of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of [[macroeconomics]], and is used by a broad array of economists, from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[monetarist]] supporters of [[laissez-faire]], such as [[Milton Friedman]], to [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] supporters of [[economic interventionism]], such as [[Joan Robinson]].

The conventional "aggregate supply and demand" model is, in actuality, a Keynesian visualization that has come to be a widely accepted image of the theory. The Classical supply and demand model, which is largely based on [[Say's law]]—that supply creates its own demand—depicts the aggregate supply curve as being vertical at all times (not just in the long-run)

==Modeling==
The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] model of the [[business cycle]]. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various [[exogeny|exogenous]] events will have on two variables:  real [[GDP]] and the [[price level]].  Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time).  The AD–AS model can be related to the [[Phillips curve]] model of wage or price inflation and unemployment. A special case is a horizontal AS curve which means the price level is constant. The AD curve represents the locus of equilibria in the [[IS–LM model]]. The two models produce the same results with a constant price level.

==Aggregate demand curve==
{{main|Aggregate demand}}
The AD (aggregate demand) curve is defined by the [[IS–LM model|IS–LM]] equilibrium income at different potential price levels. 
The downward sloping AD curve is derived from the [[IS–LM model]].
[[File:AS AD.png|thumb|IS–LM diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the interest rate plotted vertically]]
[[File:AS AD (2).png|thumb|AD–AS diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the price level plotted vertically]]
It shows the combinations of the price level and level of the output at which the goods and assets markets are simultaneously in equilibrium.
The above figure showing IS and LM curves, where LM curve shifts downward to the right to LM’ and thus shifting the new equilibrium to E’ where both goods and money market gets cleared. Now, the new output level Y’ correspond to the lower price level P’.
Thus a reduction in price, which is shown in the figure, leads to an increase in the equilibrium and spending.

The equation for the AD curve in general terms is:

: &lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{d}(\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1)&lt;/math&gt;

where Y is real [[GDP]], M is the nominal [[money supply]], P is the [[price level]], G is real [[government spending]], T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied, and Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve (exogenous influences on any component of spending) or the LM curve (exogenous influences on money demand).  The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending (meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction, aggregate demand changes in the same direction); the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it.

==Slope of AD curve==
The slope of AD curve reflects the extent to which the real balances change the equilibrium level of spending, taking both assets and goods markets into consideration.
An increase in real balances will lead to a larger increase in equilibrium income and spending, the smaller the interest responsiveness of money demand and the higher the interest responsiveness of investment demand.
An increase in real balances leads to a larger level of income and spending, the larger the value of multiplier and the smaller the income response of money demand.

This implies that:
The AD curve is flatter the smaller is the interest responsiveness of the [[demand for money]] and larger is the interest responsiveness of investment demand.
Also, the AD curve is flatter, the larger is the multiplier and the larger the income responsiveness of the demand for money.

==Effect of monetary expansion on the AD curve==
[[File:AD-AS model.png|thumb|Aggregate demand curve shifts rightward in case of a monetary expansion]]
An increase in the nominal money stock leads to a higher real money stock at each level of prices. In the asset market, the decrease in interest rates induces the public to hold higher real balances. It stimulates the aggregate demand and thereby increases the equilibrium level of income and spending.Thus, as we can see from the diagram, the aggregate demand curve shifts rightward in case of a monetary expansion.

==Aggregate supply curve==
{{main|Aggregate supply}}
The aggregate supply curve may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium. In either case, it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels. The aggregate supply curve (AS curve) describes for each given price level, the quantity of output the firms plan to supply.

The '''Keynesian aggregate supply curve''' shows that the AS curve is significantly horizontal implying that the firm will supply whatever amount of goods is demanded at a particular price level during an [[economic depression]]. The idea behind that is because there is unemployment, firms can readily obtain as much labour as they want at that current wage and production can increase without any additional costs (e.g. machines are idle which can simply be turned on). Firms' average costs of production therefore are assumed not to change as their output level changes. This provides a rationale for Keynesians' support for government intervention. The total output of an economy can decline without the price level declining; this fact, in conjunction with the Keynesian belief of wages being inflexible downwards, clarifies the need for government stimulus. Since wages cannot readily adjust low enough for aggregate supply to shift outward and improve total output, the government must intervene to accomplish this result. However, the Keynesian aggregate supply curve also contains a normally upward-sloping region where aggregate supply responds accordingly to changes in price level. The upward slope is due to the [[law of diminishing returns]] as firms increase output, which states that it will become marginally more expensive to accomplish the same level of improvement in productive capacity as firms grow. It is also due to the scarcity of natural resources, the rarity of which causes increased production to also become more expensive. The vertical section of the Keynesian curve corresponds to the physical limit of the economy, where it is impossible to increase output.

The '''classical aggregate supply curve''' comprises a short-run aggregate supply curve and a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run curve visualizes the total planned output of goods and services in the economy at a particular price level. The "short-run" is defined as the period during which only final good prices adjust and factor, or input, costs do not. The "long-run" is the period after which factor prices are able to adjust accordingly. The short-run aggregate supply curve has an upward slope for the same reasons the Keynesian AS curve has one: the law of diminishing returns and the scarcity of resources. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because factor prices will have adjusted. Factor prices increase if producing at a point beyond full employment output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply inwards so equilibrium occurs somewhere along full employment output. Monetarists have argued that demand-side expansionary policies favoured by Keynesian economists are solely inflationary. As the aggregate demand curve is shifted outward, the general price level increases. This increased price level causes households, or the owners of the [[factors of production]] to demand higher prices for their goods and services. The consequence of this is increased production costs for firms, causing short-run aggregate demand to shift back inwards. The theoretical ultimate result is inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanville |first=Alan |title=Economics From a Global Perspective |edition=Third |publisher=Glanville Books |year=2011 |page=224 |isbn=9780952474685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream AS-AD model contains both a long-run aggregate supply curve (LRAS) and a short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve essentially combining the classical and Keynesian models. In the short run wages and other resource prices are sticky and slow to adjust to new price levels. This gives way to the upward sloping SRAS. In the long-run, resource prices adjust to the price level bringing the economy back to a full employment output; along vertical LRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apeconreview.com/asad-model.html|title=AP Macroeconomics Review: AS-AD Model|last=Reed|first=Jacob|date=2016|website=APEconReview.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifts in aggregate supply curves===
The Keynesian model, in which there is no long-run aggregate supply curve and the classical model, in the case of the short-run aggregate supply curve, are affected by the same determinants. Any event that results in a change of production costs shifts the curves outwards or inwards if production costs are decreased or increased, respectively. Some factors which affect short-run production costs include: taxes and subsidies, price of labour (wages), and price of raw materials. These factors shift short-run curves ''exclusively''. Changes in the quantity and quality of labour and capital affect both long-run and short-run supply curves. A greater quantity of labour or capital corresponds to a lower price for both. A greater quality in labour or capital corresponds to a greater output per worker or machine.

The long-run aggregate supply curve of the classical model is affected by events that affect the [[potential output]] of the economy. Factors revolve around changes in the quality and quantity of factors of production.

==Fiscal and monetary policy under Classical and Keynesian cases==
Keynesian Case:
If there is a fiscal expansion i.e. there is an increase in the government spending or a cut in the taxes, it will shift the AD curve rightwards. The shift would then imply an increase in the equilibrium output and employment.

In the Classical case, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level of output. Firms will supply the equilibrium level of output whatever the price level may be.

Now, the fiscal expansion shifts the AD curve rightwards, thus leading to an increase in the demand for goods, but the firms cannot increase the output as there is no labour force which can be obtained.
As firms try to hire more labour, they bid up wages and their costs of production and thus they charge higher prices for the output.
The increase in prices reduces the real money stock and leads to an increase in the interest rates and reduction in spending.

The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is
:&lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \ \  P/P^{e}, \ \  Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;

where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), P&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge).  The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply.  The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices.

The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate.  In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation.  The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply
:&lt;math&gt;Y=Y^{s}(Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;

and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome.

==Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply==
The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right. Exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction.

===Shifts of aggregate demand===
The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would go up.  In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged.

Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve:
* An exogenous increase in consumer spending
* An exogenous increase in investment  spending on [[physical capital]]
* An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment
* An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services
* An exogenous increase in [[transfer payments]] from the government to the people
* An exogenous decrease in taxes levied
* An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries
* An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries

Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve:
* An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply
* An exogenous increase in the demand for money supply i.e. liquidity preference

===Shifts of aggregate supply===
The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase.
* An exogenous decrease in the wage rate
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress — improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output

The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right:
* An increase in population
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress

===Transition dynamics===
* Movement back to the steady state is fastest when the economy is furthest from its steady state.
* This means that as the aggregate supply is shocked by factors of production, it will move away from its steady state. In response, the supply will slowly shift back to the steady state equilibrium, first with a large reaction, then consequently smaller reactions until it reaches steady state. The reactions back to equilibrium are largest when furthest from steady state, and become smaller as they near equilibrium.

For example, a shock increase in the price of oil is felt by producers as an increase in the factors of production. This shifts the supply curve upward by raising expected inflation. This slows the adjustment of the AS curve back to its steady state. As the inflation slowly falls, so will the AS curve back to its steady state.

==Monetarism==
The modern quantity theory states that the price level is directly affected by the quantity of money.
Friedman is the recognized intellectual leader of an influential group of economists, called Monetarists, who emphasize the role of money and monetary policy in affecting the behaviour of output and prices.
Modern quantity theory also disagrees with the strict quantity theory in not believing that the supply curve is vertical in the short run.
Thus, Friedman and other monetarists made an important distinction between the short run and long run effects of changes in money. They said that in the long run money is more or less neutral. Changes in the nominal money stock have no real effects and only change prices. But in the short run, they argue that the monetary policy and changes in the money stock can have important real effects.

      <comment>I changed the definition. It now states that (1)⇔(2)⇔(3). This is a stronger statement that what was previously given. (2) and (3) consequently belong into the definition. A side effect is that no preference is given to any of the 3 conditions, as should be the case since they are equivalent.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[multilinear algebra]], an '''alternating multilinear map''' is a [[multilinear map]] with all arguments belonging to the same space (e.g., a [[bilinear form]] or a [[multilinear form]]) that is zero whenever any two adjacent arguments are equal.

The notion of '''alternatization''' (or '''alternatisation''' in [[British English]]) is used to derive an alternating multilinear map from any multilinear map with all arguments belonging to the same space.

== Definition ==

A multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''alternating''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|pages=511–512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2007|p=A III.80, §4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \neq j \leq n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Dummit|Foote|2004|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly dependent]] then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==

* In a [[Lie algebra]], the [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]] is an alternating bilinear map.

* The [[determinant]] of a matrix is a multilinear alternating map of the rows or columns of the matrix.

== Properties ==

* If any component ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an alternating multilinear map is replaced by {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for any {{nowrap|''j'' ≠ ''i''}} and ''c'' in the base ring ''R'', then the value of that map is not changed.&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every alternating multilinear map is antisymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|1995|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''n''! is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the base ring ''R'', then every antisymmetric ''n''-multilinear form is alternating.

== Alternatization ==

Given a multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt;, the alternating multilinear map &lt;math&gt;g\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;g(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)f(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(n)})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''alternatization''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

; Properties

* The alternatization of an ''n''-multilinear alternating map is ''n''! times itself.
* The alternatization of a [[symmetric map]] is zero.
* The alternatization of a [[bilinear map]] is bilinear. Most notably, the alternatization of any [[Chain complex|cocycle]] is bilinear. This fact plays a crucial role in identifying the second [[Cohomology|cohomology group]] of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with the group of alternating [[bilinear form]]s on a lattice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[topology]], an '''ambient isotopy''', also called an ''h-isotopy'', is a kind of continuous distortion of an [[ambient space]], for example a [[manifold]], taking a [[submanifold]] to another submanifold. For example in [[knot theory]], one considers two [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy.  More precisely, let ''N'' and ''M'' be manifolds and ''g'' and ''h'' be [[embedding]]s of ''N'' in ''M''.  A [[continuous map]] 
:&lt;math&gt;F:M \times [0,1] \rightarrow M &lt;/math&gt; 
is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking ''g'' to ''h'' if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity function|identity map]], each map ''F&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[homeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g'' = ''h''. This implies that the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots which are [[mirror image]]s of each other are in general not equivalent.

{{wikiquote}}
'''Boasting''' is to speak with excessive [[pride]] and self-satisfaction about one’s achievements, possessions, or abilities. This is also known as "bragging rights", which are not cancelled out by another individual's objection to said bragging rights. For example, when a young woman allegedly stopped a driver from crossing a railroad track when the train was approaching and there were no visible warnings of its approach, her rights to brag were not thwarted when another individual attempted to dispute the validity of her heroic act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boast|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/boast|publisher=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boasting occurs when someone feels a sense of satisfaction or when someone feels that whatever occurred proves their superiority and is recounting accomplishments so that others will feel admiration or [[envy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Nina|title=Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People: The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313070402|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals construct an image of themselves, a personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schlenker | first=Barry R. | year=1980 | title=Impression Management: The Self-Concept, Social Identity, and Interpersonal Relations | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Monterey/California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Millon]] theorized that in [[Impression management#Self-presentation|self-presentation]], individuals seek to balance boasting against discrediting themselves with excessive self-promotion or being caught blatantly misrepresenting themselves. Studies show that people often have a limited ability to perceive how their efforts at self-presentation are actually impacting their acceptance and likeability by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|title=Handbook of Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471384045|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of Bragging ==
Although a brag can be as straightforward as a simple claim to riches or greatness, it often assumes [https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging#iii-the-17-modes-of-bragging a variety of more subtle forms] in order to shield the speaker from any opprobrium they might otherwise receive for transgressing the social norms of humility. The most popular of these forms is the humblebrag, a term coined by comedian [[Harris Wittels]], whereby the brag is masked in a complaint. For example: “Dating websites are so much work. Every time I log in, I have like 100 new messages.”

==Religious teachings==
'''Christian bible:''' ''Thus says the Lord: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches'' (Jeremiah 9:23 ESV).

'''Quran''': ''Verily, Allâh does not like such as are proud and boastful; Those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other men and hide what Allâh has bestowed upon them of His Bounties'' (The Noble Qur'an 4:36-37).

'''Hindu Wisdom:'''  ''Whereas, in our Occident, the most dry and sterile minds brag in front of Nature'' (La Bible de l'Humanite in Oeuvres).

The Ancient Greek book ''The Characters of [[Theophrastus]]'' devotes a chapter to "The Boastful Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Theophrastus |title=The Characters of Theophrastus: An English Tr. from a Rev.

''[[Beot|Bēot]]'' is [[Old English]] for a ritualized boast, vow, threat or promise, which was usually made by an Anglo-Saxon warrior on the eve of or during battle. Bēots can be found in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', including by the hero himself.

A ''[[Gab (song)|gab]]'' ([[Old Occitan]] [ˈɡap] for "boast") is a [[troubadour]] boasting song.

Boasting and bragging are necessary components of maintaining "[[Face (sociological concept)|Face]]" in some Arab societies.&lt;ref&gt;''CIA:  Concepts of "Face"'' https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol8no3/html/v08i3a05p_0001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39622">{{about|the mock-serenading custom}}
'''Charivari''' (or '''shivaree''' or '''chivaree''') or '''Skimmington''' (or '''skimmington ride''' in England; {{lang-de|Katzenmusik}}) are terms for a folk custom in which a  mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock [[serenade]]. Since the crowd aimed to make as much noise as possible by beating on pots and pans or anything that came to hand these parades are often referred to as '''rough music'''. Parades were of three types. In the first, and generally most violent form, a wrongdoer or wrongdoers might be dragged from their home or place of work and paraded by force through a community. In the process they were subject to the derision of the crowd, they might be pelted and frequently a victim or victims were ducked{{vague|What is "ducked"?|date=March 2018}} at the end of the proceedings. A safer form involved a neighbour of the wrongdoer impersonating the victim whilst being carried through the streets. The impersonator was obviously not himself punished and he often cried out or sang ribald verses mocking the wrongdoer. In the common form an effigy was employed instead, abused and often burnt at the end of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Stephen (2014) ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760–1914'' pp. 71–72 Boydell Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84383940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities used "rough music" to express their disapproval of different types of violation of community norms. For example, they might target marriages of which they disapproved such as a union between an older widower and much younger woman, or the too early remarriage by a widow or widower. Villages also used charivari in cases of adulterous relationships, against wife beaters, and unmarried mothers. It was also used as a form of shaming upon husbands who were beaten by their wives and had not stood up for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[ https://gynocentrism.com/2015/12/02/stang-riding-as-punishment-for-male-victims-of-intimate-partner-violence/]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the community disapproved of any remarriage by older widows or widowers. ''Charivari'' is the original French word, and in Canada it is used by both English and French speakers. ''Chivaree'' became the common variant in [[Ontario, Canada]]. In the United States, the term ''shivaree'' is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bryan D. |last=Palmer |chapter=Discordant Music: Charivaris and Whitecapping in Nineteenth-Century North America |title=Crime and Deviance in Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Canadian Scholars Press |year=2005 |pages=48–49 |isbn=1-55130-274-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As species of popular justice rituals Charivaric events were carefully planned and they were often staged at times of traditional festivity thereby blending delivering justice and celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Stephen (2014)  ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760–1914'', Chapter Three Boydell Press {{ISBN|978-1-84383-940-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women seem to have been particularly prominent in both organising and participating in such events which usually began with the crowd gathering (pubs or taverns were a common meeting point) and then marching to the homes of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rex |last=Gunn |title=An Oregon Charivari |journal=Western Folklore |volume=13 |issue=2/3 |year=1954 |pages=206–207 |jstor=1520617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Charivari.jpg|thumb|alt=Medieval charivari|Depiction of charivari, early 14th century (from the ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'')]]
The origin of the word ''charivari'' is likely from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''caribaria'', plural of ''caribarium'', already referring to the custom of rattling kitchenware with an iron rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historiae Augustae scriptores VI |page=822 (note by [[Claudius Salmasius]]) |publisher=ex officina Hackiana |year=1671}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself probably from the Greek καρηβαρία (karēbaría), literally "heaviness in the head" but also used to mean "headache", from κάρα "head" and βαρύς "heavy". In any case, the tradition has been practised for at least 700 years. An engraving in the early 14th-century French manuscript, ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'', shows a charivari underway.

==Regional variations==

===England===
[[File:William Hogarth. Hudibras Encounters the Skimmington.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[William Hogarth]]'s engraving "[[Hudibras]] Encounters the Skimmington" (illustration to [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kremer| first=William| title=What medieval Europe did with its teenagers| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26289459| accessdate=23 March 2014| newspaper=BBC News Magazine| date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
So-called "Rough Music" practices in England were known by many regional or local designations. In the North the most commonly employed term was "'''stang riding'''", a stang being a long pole carried on the shoulders of two men between which an object or a person could be mounted. In the South, the term '''skimmington''', or '''skimmington ride''', was most commonly employed, a skimmington being a type of large wooden ladle with which an unruly wife might beat her husband. Other terms include "'''lewbelling'''", "'''tin-panning'''", "'''ran tanning'''", a "'''nominey'''" or "'''wooset'''".&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Stephen (2014) ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1780-1918'', P. 63 Boydell Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84383-940-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Where effigies of the "wrongdoers" were made they were frequently burned as the climax of the event (as the inscription on the Rampton photograph indicates&lt;ref name=Millington/&gt;) or "ritually drowned" (thrown into a pond or river).

The very essence of the practice was public humiliation of the victim under the eyes of their neighbours &lt;ref name="Thompson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.

In the twentieth they declined but endured in a few places, such as [[Rampton, Nottinghamshire]] (1909),&lt;ref name=Millington&gt;[http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/themes/folklore/folkloregraphic.htm The Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway: Folklore and customs, by Dr Peter Millington] Includes a rare photograph of a ran-tan at Rampton, Nottinghamshire (1909)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middleton Cheney]] (1909) and [[Blisworth]] (1920s and 1936), Northamptonshire.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;Dorothy A Grimes, ''Like Dew Before the Sun – Life and Language in Northamptonshire'', pp.&amp;nbsp;6–8, Privately published, Stanley L Hunt (printers), Rushden, 1991. {{ISBN|0-9518496-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were in fact some examples after the Second World War at West Hoathley in Sussex in 1947 and Copthorne Sussex around 1951 and an attempt at traditional rough music practice was last documented by the folklorist Theo Brown in a Devonshire village around 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Stephen (2014) ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760-1914'' Boydell Press. {{ISBN|978-1-84383-940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noisy, masked processions were held outside the home of the supposed wrongdoer, involving the cacophonous rattling of bones and cleavers, the ringing of bells, hooting, blowing bull's horns, the banging of frying pans, saucepans, kettles, or other kitchen or barn implements with the intention of creating long-lasting embarrassment to the alleged perpetrator.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{cite book | last = Cox | first = Christoph | title = Audio Culture | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8264-1614-4 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a rough music performance, the victim could be displayed upon a pole or donkey (in person or as an effigy), their "crimes" becoming the subject of mime, theatrical performances or [[recitatives]], along with a litany of obscenities and insults.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; Alternatively, one of the participants would "ride the stang" (a pole carried between the shoulders of two or more men or youths) while banging an old kettle or pan with a stick and reciting a rhyme (called a "nominy") such as the following:

{{poemquote|
With a ran, tan, tan,
On my old tin can,
Mrs. _______ and her good man.
She bang'd him, she bang'd him,
For spending a penny when he stood in need.
She up with a three-footed stool;
She struck him so hard, and she cut so deep,
Till the blood run down like a new stuck sheep!&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924027937956#page/n235/mode/2up Archive.org: John Brand, ''The Popular Antiquities of Great Britain'', (1905 edition) p. 563 (quoting ''Costume of Yorkshire'', 1814)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rough music processions are well attested in the medieval period as punishments for violations of the assumed gender norms. Men who had allowed themselves to be dominated by their shrewish wives were liable to be targeted and a frieze from Montecute House, an Eizabethan Manor in Somerset depicts just such an occurrence. However, in the nineteenth century the practice seems to have been somewhat refocused; whilst in the early period rough music was often used against men who had failed to assert their authority over their wives, by the end of the nineteenth century it was mostly targeted against men who had exceeded their authority by beating them.&lt;ref&gt;Banks Stephen, (2014) ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760-1914'' p. 92. p. 99 {{ISBN|978-1-84383-940-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in contrast to the verses above referring to a shrewish wife there were also songs referring to the use of rough music as a protection for wives.

Rough music song originating from [[South Stoke, Oxfordshire]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bloxham | first = Christine | title = Folklore of Oxfordshire | publisher = Tempus | location = | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7524-3664-3 |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|
There is a man in our town
Who often beats his wife,
So if he does it any more,
We'll put his nose right out before.
Holler boys, holler boys,
Make the bells ring,
Holler boys, holler boys.
God save the King.}}

The participants were generally young men temporarily bestowed with the power of rule over the everyday affairs of the community.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; As above, issues of sexuality and domestic hierarchy most often formed the pretexts for rough music,&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; including acts of domestic violence or child abuse. However, rough music was also used as a sanction against those who committed certain species of economic crimes such as blocking footpaths, preventing traditional gleaning or profiteering at times of poor harvests. Occupational groups, such as butchers, employed rough music against others in the same trade who refused to abide by the commonly agreed labour customs.&lt;ref&gt;Banks Stephen, ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760-1914'' Chapter Five&lt;/ref&gt;

Rough music practices would often be repeated for three or up to seven nights in a row.&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt; Many victims fled their communities and cases of suicide are not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Banks Stephen (2014) ''Informal Justice in England and Wales, 1760 - 1914'' pp. 76 - 82. Boydell Press {{ISBN|978-1-84383-940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As forms of [[Vigilante|vigilantism]] that were likely to lead to [[Riot|public disorder]], ran-tanning and similar activities were banned under the Highways Act of 1882.&lt;ref name="Millington" /&gt;

====Origins, history and form====
Skimmingtons are recorded in England in early medieval times and they are recorded in colonial America from around the 1730s.&lt;ref name="pencak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/justataste/samplechapters/justatastepencak.html|title=Riot and Revelry in Early America: Introduction|last=Pencak|first=William|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=2009-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901074147/http://www.psupress.psu.edu/Justataste/samplechapters/justatastePencak.html|archivedate=2006-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCHP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/176/entry|title=Skimmington|last=Kickler|first=Troy L.|work=North Carolina History Project|publisher=John Locke Foundation|accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is particularly associated with the [[West Country]] region of England and, although the etymology is not certain, it has been suggested that it derived from the [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]] used in that region for cheesemaking, which was perceived as a weapon used by a woman to beat a weak or henpecked husband.  The rationale for a skimmington varied, but one major theme was disapproval of a man for weakness in his relationship with his wife. A description of the custom in 1856 cites three main targets: a man who is worsted by his wife in a quarrel; a cuckolded man who accepts his wife's [[adultery]]; and any married person who engages in licentious conduct.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=George|authorlink=George Roberts (antiquary)|title=The Social History of the People of the Southern Counties of England in Past Centuries|publisher=Longman|year=1856|pages=535–536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hIPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To "ride such a person skimmington" involved exposing them or their effigy to ridicule on a cart, or on the back of a horse or donkey.  Some accounts describe the participants as carrying ladles and spoons with which to beat each other, at least in the case of skimmingtons prompted by marital discord.  The noisy parade passed through the neighbourhood, and served as a punishment to the offender and a warning to others to abide by community norms; Roberts suggests that the homes of other potential victims were visited in a pointed manner during a skimmington.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; According to one citation, a skimmington was broken up by the police in a village in Dorset as late as 1917;&lt;ref name="page"&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Norman|title=The Mayor of Casterbridge|publisher=Broadview Press|year=1997|chapter=Appendix G: The Skimmington Ride|isbn=978-1-55111-122-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5p3E9oL2G4EC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=skimmington&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incidents have been reported from the 1930s, the 1950s and perhaps even the 1970s.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Seal, Graham, "A 'Hussitting' in Berkshire, 1930" (''Folklore'', vol. 98, No. 1 (1987), 91, 93.

The antiquary and lexicographer [[Francis Grose]] described a skimmington as: "Saucepans, frying-pans, poker and tongs, marrow-bones and cleavers, bulls horns, etc. beaten upon and sounded in ludicrous processions" ''([[A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue]]'', 1796).

In Warwickshire, the custom was known as "loo-belling", and in northern England as "riding the stang".&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;  Other names given to this or similar customs were "rough-musicking" and "hussitting" (said to be a reference to the [[Hussites]] or followers of [[John Huss]]).&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

====Western Rising====

During the [[Western Rising]] of 1628–31, which was a rebellion in south-west England against the [[enclosure]] of royal forest lands, the name "Lady Skimmington" was adopted by the leader of the protest movement.&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allan|first=D.

Tuneless, cacophonous "rough music", played on horns, bugles, whistles, tin trays and frying pans, was a feature of the custom known as ''Teddy Rowe's Band''. This had taken place annually, possibly for several centuries, in the early hours of the morning, to herald the start of [[Pack Monday Fair]] at [[Sherborne, Dorset]], until it was banned by the police in 1964 because of hooliganism the previous year.&lt;ref name="Hole"&gt;Hole, Christina (1978).

===Europe===

Equivalents include the German [[:de:haberfeldtreiben|Haberfeldtreiben]] and [[:de:katzenmusik|Katzenmusik]], Italian [[:it:scampanate|scampanate]] and French [[:fr:charivari|charivari]].&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

The custom has been documented back to the [[Middle Ages]] but it is likely that it was traditional before that. It was first recorded in France, as a regular wedding activity to celebrate the nuptials at some point after the vows had been taken. But charivari achieved its greatest importance as it became transformed into a form of community censure against socially unacceptable marriages; for example, the marriage of [[widow]]s before the end of the customary social period of formal [[mourning]]. In the early 17th century at the [[Council of Tours]], the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] forbade the ritual of charivari and threatened its practitioners with [[excommunication]]. It did not want the community taking on the judgment and punishment of parishioners. But the custom continued in rural areas.

The charivari as celebration was a custom initially practised by the upper classes, but as time went on, the lower classes also participated and often looked forward to the next opportunity to join in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Longmore |title=The Charivari or Canadian Poetics |location=Ottawa |publisher=The Golden Dog Press |year=1977 |page=57 |isbn=0-919614-18-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main purposes of the charivari in Europe were to facilitate change in the current social structure and to act as a form of [[censure]] within the community. The goal was to enforce social standards and to rid the community of socially unacceptable relationships that threatened the stability of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Loretta T. |last=Johnson |title=Charivari/Shivaree: A European Folk Ritual on American Plains |journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=1990 |pages=371–387 [p. 379] |jstor=204083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe various types of charivari took place that differed from similar practices in other parts of the world. For example, the community might conduct a stag hunt against adulterers by creating a mock chase of human "stags" by human "hounds". The hounds would pursue the stags (that is, those who were committing the adulterous relationship) and dispense animal blood on their doorsteps. European charivaris were highly provocative, leading to overt public humiliation. The people used them to acknowledge and correct misbehaviour. In other parts of the world, similar public rituals around nuptials were practised mostly for celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1990), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humiliation]] was the most common consequence of the European charivari. The acts which victims endured were forms of social ostracism often so embarrassing that they would leave the community for places where they were not known.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1990), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the charivari resulted in [[murder]] or [[suicide]]. Examples from the south of [[France]] include five cases of a charivari victim's firing on his accusers: these incidents resulted in two people being blinded and three killed. Some victims committed suicide, unable to recover from the public humiliation and social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Violet |last=Alford |title=Rough Music or Charivari |journal=Folklore |volume=70 |issue=4 |year=1959 |pages=505–518 [p. 510] |jstor=1258223 |doi=10.1080/0015587x.1959.9717197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the blowing of car horns after weddings in France (and indeed in many European countries) today is a holdover from the charivari of the past.&lt;ref name="LeGoff1981"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Le Goff |editor1-first=Jacques |editor2-last=Schmitt |editor2-first=Jean-Claude |title=Le charivari |publisher=École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales |location=Paris |year=1981 |page=141 |isbn=2-7132-0754-1 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
Charivari has been practised in much of the United States, but it was most frequent on the frontier, where communities were small and more formal enforcement was lacking. It was documented into the early 20th century, but was thought to have mostly died out by mid century. In [[Canada]], charivaris have occurred in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and the Atlantic provinces, but not always as an expression of disapproval.

The early French colonists took the custom of charivari (or ''shivaree'' in the United States) to their settlements in Quebec. Some historians believe the custom spread to English-speaking areas of Lower Canada and eventually into the American South, but it was independently common in English society, so was likely to be part of Anglo-American customs. Charivari is well documented in the [[Hudson Valley]] from the earliest days of English settlers through the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wermuth|first1=Thomas S.|title=Charivari on the Hudson: Misrule, Disorder, and Festive Play in the Countryside, 1750 -1900|journal=The Hudson River Valley Review|date=Spring 2016|volume=32|issue=2|pages=27–52|url=http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/review/pdfs/hrvr_32pt2_online.pdf|publisher=Hudson River Valley Institute at [[Marist College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest documented examples of Canadian charivari were in Quebec in the mid-17th century. One of the most notable was on June 28, 1683. After the widow of François Vézier dit Laverdure remarried only three weeks after her husband’s death, people of Quebec City conducted a loud and strident charivari against the newlyweds at their home.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2005), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As practised in North America, the charivari tended to be less extreme and punitive than the traditional European custom. Each was unique and heavily influenced by the standing of the family involved, as well as who was participating. While embellished with some European traditions, in a North American charivari participants might throw the culprits into horse tanks or force them to buy candy bars for the crowd.

{{quote|All in fun{{spnd}}it was just a shiveree, you know, and nobody got mad about it. At least not very mad.|source=Johnson (1990), p. 382.}}

This account from an American charivari in Kansas exemplifies the North American attitude. In contrast to punitive charivari in small villages in Europe, meant to ostracize and isolate the evildoers, North American charivaris were used as "unifying rituals", in which those in the wrong were brought back into the community after what might amount to a minor [[hazing]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1990), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; In some communities the ritual served as a gentle spoof of the newlyweds, intended to disrupt for a while any sexual activities that might be under way. In parts of the midwest US, such as Kansas, in the mid 1960-1970s, shivaree customs continued as good natured wedding humour along the lines of the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. Rituals included wheeling the bride about in a wheelbarrow or tying cowbells under a wedding bed.

In Tampa, Florida in September 1885, a large chivaree was held on the occasion of local official James T. Magbee's wedding. According to historian Kyle S. Vanlandingham, the party was "the wildest and noisiest of all the chivaree parties in Tampa's history," attended by "several hundred" men and lasting "until near daylight." The music produced during the chivaree was reportedly "hideous and unearthly beyond description."&lt;ref&gt;Kyle S. Vanlandingham, "James T. Magbee: ‘Union Man, Undoubted Secessionist and High Priest in the Radical Synagogue," ''Sunland Tribune'' 20, no. 1 (1994): 7–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charivari is believed to have inspired the development of the [[Acadia]]n tradition of [[Tintamarre]].

==Importance of noise==
The use of excessive noise was a universal practice in association with variations in the custom. Loud singing and chanting were common in Europe, including England, and throughout North America. For an 1860 English charivari against a wife-beater, someone wrote an original chant which the crowd was happy to adopt:

{{poemquote|
Has beat his wife!
Has beat his wife!
It is a very great shame and disgrace
To all who live in this place
It is indeed upon my life!&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2005), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Europe the noise, songs, and chants had special meanings for the crowd. For adulterers, the songs represented the community’s disgust. For a too-early remarriage of a widow or widower, the noises symbolized the scream of the late husband or wife in the night.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1990), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages==

Perhaps the most common usage of the word today is in relation to circus performances, where a 'charivari' is a type of show opening that sees a raucous tumble of clowns and other performers into the playing space.  This is the most common form of entrance used in today's classical [[circus]], whereas the two and three-ring circuses of the last century usually preferred a parade, or a 'spec'.

Charivari was sometimes called "riding the 'stang", when the target was a man who had been subject to scolding, beating, or other abuse from his wife. The man was made to "ride the 'stang", which meant that he was placed backwards on a horse, mule or ladder and paraded through town to be mocked, while people banged pots and pans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gynocentrism.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/stanging-for-man-whose-wife-beats-him.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gynocentrism.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/wife-beat-him.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gynocentrism.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/stanging-for-a-man-beaten-by-a-wife-mentioned-top.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gynocentrism.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/stanging-1829.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The charivari was used to belittle those who could not or would not consummate their marriage. In the mid-16th century, historic records attest to a charivari against [[Martin Guerre]] in the small village of [[Artigat]] in the French [[Pyrenees]] for that reason. After he married at the age of 14, his wife did not get pregnant for eight years, so villagers ridiculed him. Later in his life, another man took over Guerre's identity and life. The trial against the impostor was what captured the events for history. In the 20th century, the events formed the basis of a French film, ''[[Le Retour de Martin Guerre]]'' (1982) and the history, ''The Return of Martin Guerre'', by the American history professor [[Natalie Zemon Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Natalie Zemon |last=Davis |title=The Return of Martin Guerre |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-674-76690-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the charivari widely practised among rural villagers across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=E. P. |chapter=Rough Music |title=Customs in Common |location=New York |publisher=New Press |year=1993 |pages=467–531 |isbn=1-56584-003-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term and practice were part of common culture.  Over time, the word was applied to other items. In [[Bavaria]], ''charivari'' was adopted as the name for the silver ornaments worn with [[Lederhosen]]; the items consist of small trophies from game, like teeth from wild boar, or deer, jaws and fangs from foxes and various marters, feathers and claws from jaybirds and bird of prey. A Bavarian Charivari resembles the so-called "chatelaine," a women's ornament consisting of a silver chain with numerous pendants like a mini silver box of needles, a small pair of scissors, a tiny bottle of perfume, etc..

In the [[Philippines]], the term "Charivari" is used by the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]] for a type of criminalised [[Disorderly conduct|public disorder]]. Defined in Article 155 as a medley of discordant voices, it is classed under alarm and scandal and is a punishable by a fine.

== In music ==

Charivari would later be taken up by composers of the [[French Baroque]] tradition as a 'rustic' or 'pastoral' character piece. Notable examples are those of the renowned [[viola da gamba]] virtuoso [[Marin Marais]] in his five collections of pieces for the ''basse de viole'' and [[Basso continuo|continuo]]. Some are quite advanced and difficult and subsequently evoke the title's origins.

The British [[period instrument]]/[[early music]] ensemble, Charivari Agréable (founded in 1993), states that their name translates as, "'pleasant tumult' (from Saint-Lambert’s 1707 treatise on accompaniment)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charivari.co.uk/index.html All about us], from Charivari Agréable's official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complexity''' characterises the behaviour of a [[system]] or [[model (disambiguation)|model]] whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{cite book

The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of [[emergence]] greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].

[[Science]] {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;

Johnson|Neil Johnson]] states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."  Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

== Overview ==
Definitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential "[[system]]" – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.

[[Warren Weaver]] posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Phenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront "dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole".&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt; Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.

Some definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.

== Disorganized vs. organized ==
One of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.

Weaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between "disorganized complexity" and "organized complexity".

In Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a "disorganized complexity" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.

A prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of planetary orbits – the latter can be predicted by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sir James Lighthill and Modern Fluid Mechanics", by Lokenath Debnath, The University of Texas-Pan American, US, Imperial College Press: {{ISBN|978-1-84816-113-9}}: {{ISBN|1-84816-113-1}}, Singapore, page 31. Online at http://cs5594.userapi.com/u11728334/docs/25eb2e1350a5/Lokenath_Debnath_Sir_James_Lighthill_and_mode.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to "emerge," without any "guiding hand".

The number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and factors ==
There are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.

The source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.

In the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert, "Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective", Columbia, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.

== Varied meanings ==
In several scientific fields, "complexity" has a precise meaning:

* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm. This allows classification of computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP,]] etc.). An axiomatic approach to computational complexity was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.
* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. [[Minimum message length]] is a practical application of this approach. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, M. (1982) Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations, Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v.25, No. 3, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to Kolmogorov complexity. It is possible to treat different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).
* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].
* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[Quantum state|state vector]] of the system. This should not be confused with [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy in [[statistical mechanics]].
* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn–Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].
* In [[Network theory]] complexity is the product of richness in the connections between components of a system,&lt;ref&gt;A complex network analysis example: "[http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/ Complex Structures and International Organizations]" ({{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia. L'esempio della cooperazione intellettuale della Società delle Nazioni | journal = Memoria e Ricerca | date = 2017| pages = 371–393| url = https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.14647/87204 | doi = 10.14647/87204}} See also: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01610098v2 French version]).&lt;/ref&gt; and defined by a very unequal distribution of certain measures (some elements being highly connected and some very few, see [[complex network]]). 
* In [[software engineering]], [[programming complexity]] is a measure of the interactions of the various elements of the software. This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.
* In [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] sense – Abstract Complexity, is based on visual structures [[perception]] &lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Stanowski (2011) Abstract Complexity Definition, Complicity 2, p.78-83 [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/complicity/article/view/11156]&lt;/ref&gt; It is complexity of binary string defined as a square of features number divided by number of elements (0's and 1's). Features comprise here all distinctive arrangements of 0's and 1's. Though the features number have to be always approximated the definition is precise and meet intuitive criterion.

Other fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:

* A [[complex adaptive system]] has some or all of the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson" /&gt;
** The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial – however, there is no general rule to separate "trivial" from "non-trivial";
** The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];
** The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;
** The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;
** The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment;
** The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.

== Study ==
Complexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex – displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]] – is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.

The use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting "stovepipes" and effective "integrated" solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lissack, Michael R.]]; [[Johan Roos]] (2000). ''The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity.'' Intercultural Press. {{ISBN|978-1-85788-235-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.

While this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s, social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30193748/Complexics_as_a_Meta-Transdisciplinary_Field|title=Complexics as a meta-transdisciplinary field|last=Bastardas-Boada|first=Albert|date=|website=Academia.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].

== Topics ==

=== Behaviour ===
The behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and [[self-organization]]. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.

===Mechanisms ===
Recent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].

=== Simulations ===
In [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].

=== Systems ===
{{main article|Complex system}}
[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (in recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including [[biology]], [[economics]], social studies and [[technology]]. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al, [[non-linearity|non-linear]], and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.

=== Data ===
In [[information theory]], algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.

Complex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command "X" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like "18995316"), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the "translation" language – which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.

These algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity{{who|date=October 2013}}.

[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.

Recent work in [[machine learning]] has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] for [[binary classification]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, T.K.; Basu, M. (2002). "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=990132&amp;tag=1 Complexity Measures of Supervised Classification Problems]". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (3), pp 289–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity measures broadly cover:
* the overlaps in feature values from differing classes.
* the separability of the classes.
* measures of geometry, topology, and density of [[manifold]]s. Instance hardness is another approach seeks to characterize the data complexity with the goal of determining how hard a data set is to classify correctly and is not limited to binary problems.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R.; Martinez, T.; Giraud-Carrier, C. (2014). "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5422-z An Instance Level Analysis of Data Complexity]". Machine Learning, 95(2): 225–256.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Saez, J.; Luengo, J.; Herrera, F. (2013). "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320312003251 Predicting Noise Filtering Efficacy with Data Complexity Measures for Nearest Neighbor Classification]". Pattern Recognition 46 (1) pp 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt; and could be expanded to other areas.

=== In molecular recognition ===
A recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes [[molecular recognition]] as a phenomenon of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Complexity in molecular recognition | author=Jorg Grunenberg | journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. | year=2011 | volume=13 | pages= 10136–10146 | doi=10.1039/c1cp20097f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even for small molecules like [[carbohydrates]], the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual [[hydrogen bond]]'s strength is exactly known.

== Applications ==
Computational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems – that is, the difficulty of [[problem solving|solving]] them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm – usually a computer program – to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 2^n)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit – the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.

Even though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.

There exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].

There is another form of complexity called [[Model of hierarchical complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.

'''Daniel Goleman''' (born March 7, 1946) is an author and [[science journalist]]. For twelve years, he wrote for ''[[The New York Times]]'', reporting on the brain and behavioral sciences. His 1995 book ''[[Emotional Intelligence]]'' was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for a year-and-a-half, a best-seller in many countries, and is in print worldwide in 40 languages. Apart from his books on [[emotional intelligence]], Goleman has written books on topics including self-deception, creativity, transparency, meditation, social and emotional learning, ecoliteracy and the ecological crisis, and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]’s vision for the future.

==Biography==
Daniel Goleman grew up in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] household in [[Stockton, California]], the son of Fay Goleman (née Weinberg; 1910–2010), professor of sociology at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100926/A_NEWS/9260312 |accessdate=September 13, 2015 |title=Goleman was Pacific professor, women's advocate |publisher=The Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irving Goleman (1898–1961), humanities professor at the Stockton College (now [[San Joaquin Delta College]]). His mother's brother was nuclear physicist [[Alvin M. Weinberg]].

Goleman studied in [[India]] using a pre-doctoral fellowship from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and a post-doctoral grant from the [[Social Science Research Council]]. While in India, he spent time with spiritual teacher [[Neem Karoli Baba]], who was also the guru to [[Ram Dass]], [[Krishna Das (singer)|Krishna Das]] and [[Larry Brilliant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/krishna_das/|title=Krishna Das : Songwriter Interviews|author=|date=|website=www.songfacts.com|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote his first book based on travel in India and [[Sri Lanka]].

Goleman then returned as a visiting lecturer to Harvard, where during the 1970s his course on the psychology of consciousness was popular. [[David McClelland]], his mentor at Harvard, recommended him for a job at ''[[Psychology Today]]'', from which he was recruited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danielgoleman.info/biography/ |publisher=Daniel Goleman |title=Bio |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goleman co-founded the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at [[Yale University]]'s Child Studies Center, which then moved to the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. Currently he co-directs the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at [[Rutgers University]]. He sits on the board of the [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind &amp; Life Institute]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Career==

Goleman authored the internationally best-selling book ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995, Bantam Books), which spent more than one-and-a-half years on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list. In "Working with Emotional Intelligence" (1998, Bantam Books), Goleman developed the argument that non-cognitive skills can matter as much as [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] for workplace success, and made a similar argument for leadership effectiveness in ''Primal Leadership'' (2001, Harvard Business School Press). Goleman's most recent best-seller is ''Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence'' (Harper, 2013).

In his first book, ''[[The Meditative Mind|The Varieties of Meditative Experience]]'' (1977) (republished in 1988 as ''The Meditative Mind''), Goleman describes almost a dozen different [[meditation]] systems. He wrote that "the need for the meditator to retrain his [[attention]], whether through [[Attentional control|concentration]] or [[mindfulness]], is the single invariant ingredient in the recipe for [[altered states of consciousness|altering consciousness]] of every meditation system".&lt;ref name="varmed"&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''The Varieties of Meditative Experience''. New York: Tarcher. {{ISBN|978-0-87477-833-5}}. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Goleman has received many awards, including: 
* Career Achievement award for journalism from the [[American Psychological Association]]{{cn|date=October 2017}}
* Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral sciences to the public{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)''' is a [[surrogate model]]ing technique used in engineering. A surrogate model (alternatively known as a [[metamodeling|metamodel]], [[response surface methodology|response surface]] or emulator) is a prediction of the output of an expensive computer code.
&lt;ref name = mitchell1992&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Morris | first2 = M. | title = Bayesian design and analysis of computer experiments: two examples | url = http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A2n23.pdf | journal = Statistica Sinica | year = 1992 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This prediction is based on a small number of evaluations of the expensive computer code.

== Introduction ==
[[File:GEK test-function.png|thumb|400px|Example of one-dimensional data interpolated by Kriging and GEK. The black line indicates the test-function, while the gray circles indicate 'observations', 'samples' or 'evaluations' of the test-function. The blue line is the Kriging mean, the shaded blue area illustrates the Kriging standard deviation. With GEK we can add the gradient information, illustrated in red, which increases the accuracy of the prediction.]]

Adjoint solvers are now becoming available in a range of [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) solvers, such as [[Ansys|Fluent]], [[OpenFOAM]], [[SU2 code|SU2]] and US3D. Originally developed for [[optimization]], adjoint solvers are now finding more and more use in [[uncertainty quantification]].

=== Linear speedup ===
An adjoint solver allows one to compute the [[gradient]] of the quantity of interest with respect to all design parameters at the cost of one additional solve. This, potentially, leads to a [[linear]] speedup: the computational cost of constructing an accurate surrogate decrease, and the resulting computational speedup &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; scales linearly with the number &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of design parameters.

The reasoning behind this linear speedup is straightforward. Assume we run &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; primal solves and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; adjoint solves, at a total cost of &lt;math&gt;2N&lt;/math&gt;. This results in &lt;math&gt;N+dN&lt;/math&gt; data; &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; values for the quantity of interest and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; partial derivatives in each of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; gradients. Now assume that each partial derivative provides as much information for our surrogate as a single primal solve. Then, the total cost of getting the same amount of information from primal solves only is &lt;math&gt;N+dN&lt;/math&gt;. The speedup is the ratio of these costs:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{N+dN}{2N} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}d&lt;/math&gt;.

A linear speedup has been demonstrated for a [[fluid-structure interaction]] problem &lt;ref name = debaar2012/&gt; and for a [[transonic]] [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name = debaar2015/&gt;

=== Noise ===
One issue with adjoint-based gradients in CFD is that they can be particularly [[Noise (signal processing)|noisy]].

&lt;ref name = giles2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles | first1 = M. | last2 = Duta | first2 = M. | last3 = Muller | first3 = J. | last4 = Pierce | first4 = N. | title = Algorithm Developments for Discrete Adjoint Methods | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.1961 | journal = AIAA Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–205 | year = 2003| doi = 10.2514/2.1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When derived in a [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] framework, GEK allows one to incorporate not only the gradient information, but also the [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] in that gradient information.&lt;ref name = debaar2014a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Baar | first1 = J.H.S. | last2 = Dwight | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Bijl | first3 = H. | year = 2014 | title = Improvements to gradient-enhanced Kriging using a Bayesian interpretation | url = http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/52034eb04b657aea,348c4184660ca52f,5e1970130bd779d8.html | journal = International Journal for Uncertainty Quantification | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–223 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
When using GEK one takes the following steps:

# '''Create a Design of Experiment (DoE):''' The DoE or 'sampling plan' is a list of different locations in the design space. The DoE indicates which combinations of parameters one will use to sample the computer simulation. With Kriging and GEK, a common choice is to use a Latin Hypercube Design (LHS) design with a 'maximin' criterion. The LHS-design is available in scripting codes like [[MATLAB]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
# '''Make observations:''' For each sample in our DoE one runs the computer simulation to obtain the Quantity of Interest (QoI).
# '''Construct the surrogate:''' One uses the GEK predictor equations to construct the surrogate conditional on the obtained observations.

Once the surrogate has been constructed it can be used in different ways, for example for surrogate-based [[Uncertainty Quantification]] (UQ) or [[optimization]].

== Predictor equations ==
In a [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] framework, we use [[Bayes' Theorem]] to predict the [[Kriging]] mean and covariance conditional on the observations. When using GEK, the observations are usually the results of a number of computer simulations. GEK can be interpreted as a form of [[Gaussian process]] regression.

=== Kriging ===
Along the lines of, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wikle | first1 = C.K. | last2 = Berliner | first2 = L.M. | year = 2007 | title = A Bayesian tutorial for data assimilation | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016727890600354X | journal = Physica D | volume = 230 | issue = 1–2| pages = 1–16 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt; we are interested in the output &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of our computer simulation, for which we assume the [[normal distribution|normal]] [[prior probability|prior probability distribution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;X\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,P)&lt;/math&gt;,

with prior mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and prior [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have the normal [[likelihood]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Y|x\sim\mathcal{N}(Hx,R)&lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; the observation matrix and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; the observation error covariance matrix, which contains the [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]]. After applying [[Bayes' Theorem]] we obtain a normally distributed [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]], with Kriging mean:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(X|y) = \mu + K(y-H\mu)&lt;/math&gt;,

and Kriging covariance:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cov}(X|y) = (I-KH)P&lt;/math&gt;,

where we have the gain matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;K = PH^T(R+HPH^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

In Kriging, the prior covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is generated from a covariance function. One example of a covariance function is the Gaussian covariance:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \sigma^2 \mathrm{exp}\left(-\sum_k\frac{|\xi_{jk}-\xi_{ik}|^2}{2 \theta_k^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where we sum over the dimensions &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are the input parameters. The [[hyperparameter]]s &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated from a [[maximum likelihood estimation|Maximum Likelihood Estimate]] (MLE).&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
&lt;ref name = dwight2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dwight | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Han | first2 = Z.-H. | year = 2009 | title = Efficient uncertainty quantification using gradient-enhanced Kriging | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2009-2276 | journal = 11th AIAA Non-Deterministic Approaches Conference, Palm Springs, California, 4–7 May | volume = | issue = | pages = | doi =10.2514/6.2009-2276| isbn = 978-1-60086-975-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect GEK ===
There are several ways of implementing GEK. The first method, indirect GEK, defines a small but finite stepsize &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and uses the gradient information to append synthetic data to the observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, see for example.&lt;ref name = dwight2009 /&gt; Indirect Kriging is sensitive to the choice of the step-size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and cannot include [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]].

=== Direct GEK (through prior covariance matrix) ===
Direct GEK is a form of co-Kriging, where we add the gradient information as co-variables. This can be done by modifying the prior covariance &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or by modifying the observation matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;; both approaches lead to the same GEK predictor. When we construct direct GEK through the prior covariance matrix, we append the partial derivatives to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and modify the prior covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that it also contains the derivatives (and second derivatives) of the covariance function, see for example 
&lt;ref name = laurenceau2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurenceau | first1 = J. | last2 = Sagaut | first2 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Building efficient response surfaces of aerodynamic functions with Kriging and coKriging | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.32308 | journal = AIAA Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 498–507 | doi =10.2514/1.32308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
The main advantages of direct GEK over indirect GEK are: 1) we do not have to choose a step-size, 2) we can include [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]] for the gradients in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and 3) it is less susceptible to poor [[condition number|conditioning]] of the gain matrix &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
&lt;ref name = dwight2009 /&gt;

=== Direct GEK (through observation matrix) ===
Another way of arriving at the same direct GEK predictor is to append the partial derivatives to the observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and include partial derivative operators in the observation matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, see for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = de Baar | first1 = J.H.S. | year = 2014 | title = Stochastic Surrogates for Measurements and Computer Models of Fluids | url = http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A79d2dc5a-9a7c-4179-a417-a50cbba2bc5f?collection=research | journal = PhD thesis, Delft University of Technology | volume = | issue = | pages = 99–101 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems (Indirect method) ===

Current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the number of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the correlation matrix, where new information is added for each sampling point in each direction of the design space. Furthermore, they do not scale well with the number of independent variables due to the increase in the number of hyperparameters that needs to be estimated.
To address this issue, a new gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that drastically reduced the number of hyperparameters through the use of the [[Partial least squares regression|partial-least squares]] method that maintains accuracy is developed. In addition, this method is able to control the size of the correlation matrix by adding only relevant points defined through the information provided by the partial-least squares method. For more details, see &lt;ref name = bouhlel2018&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouhlel | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Martins | first2 = J.R.R.A. | year = 2018 | title = Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-018-0590-x | journal = Engineering with Computers | doi =10.1007/s00366-018-0590-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
This approach is implemented into the Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) in Python (https://github.com/SMTorg/SMT), and it runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. SMT is distributed under the New BSD license.

== Example: Drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil ==
[[File:Transonic airfoil.png|thumb|400px|Transonic airfoil.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil reference.png|thumb|400px|Reference results for the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. The horizontal and vertical axis show the deformation of the shape of the airfoil.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil Kriging.png|thumb|400px|Kriging surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil GEK.png|thumb|400px|GEK surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run, the arrows indicate the gradients.]]

As an example, let us consider the flow over a [[transonic]] [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name = debaar2015/&gt; The airfoil is operating at a [[Mach number]] of 0.8 and an [[angle of attack]] of 1.25 degrees. We assume that the shape of the airfoil is uncertain; the top and the bottom of the airfoil might have shifted up or down due to manufacturing tolerances. In other words, the shape of the airfoil that we are using might be slightly different from the airfoil that we designed.

On the right we see the reference results for the [[drag coefficient]] of the airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. Note that the lowest drag, which corresponds to 'optimal' performance, is close to the undeformed 'baseline' design of the airfoil at (0,0).

After designing a sampling plan (indicated by the gray dots) and running the CFD solver at those sample locations, we obtain the Kriging surrogate model. The Kriging surrogate is close to the reference, but perhaps not as close as we would desire.

In the last figure, we have improved the accuracy of this surrogate model by including the adjoint-based gradient information, indicated by the arrows, and applying GEK.

== Applications ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">{{About|the Islamic concept of wisdom||Hikma (disambiguation)}}

{{Contains Arabic text|section}}
'''''Hikmah''''' (also '''''Hikmat''''', {{lang-ar|حكمة}}, ''{{transl|ar|ḥikma}}'', literally [[wisdom]], philosophy; rationale, underlying reason,&lt;ref name="wehr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehr|first1=Hans|editor1-last=Cowan|editor1-first=J. Milton|title=A DIctionary of Modern Written Arabic, Arabic-English|date=1961|publisher=MacDonald &amp; Evans Ltd.|page=197|edition=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a concept in [[Islamic philosophy]] and law.

[[Mulla Sadra]] defined ''hikmah'' as "coming to know the essence of beings as they really are" or as "a man's becoming an intellectual world corresponding to the objective world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cooper|first=John|title=Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|volume=6|pages=595–599|location=London; New York|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=978-0415073103|via=Islamic Philosophy Online|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Islamic commentaries describe hikmah as "to know the best of things by way of the best of sciences ...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Mandhur|title=Lisan al-'Arab|pages=15/30}}&lt;/ref&gt; having experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Asma'i|title=as-Sihah|pages=5/1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "justice in judging", "knowledge of the reality of things",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taj al-'Arus'|pages=8/353}}&lt;/ref&gt; "that which prevents ignorance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Faris's|title=Mu'jam Maqayis al-Lughah|pages=2/91}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting "things in their proper places, assigning them to their proper status", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taysir al-Karim ar-Rahman|pages=1/233}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Qayyim]], the highest and most exclusive of the three levels of hikmah are "reserved for the [[Sahabah|Companions]] over the rest of the [[Ummah]], and it is the highest level that the [Islamic] scholars can reach."{{cn|date=November 2016}}

As a term of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Taqi Usmani]] describes it as meaning "the wisdom and the philosophy taken into account by the legislator while framing the [Islamic] law or the benefit intended to be drawn by [the law's] enforcement". One Dr Dipertua calls it "the objectives and wisdom" as "prescribed by Shariah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asyraf Wajdi Bin Dato’ Hj. Dusuki Yang Dipertua|title=The Challenge of Realizing Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Finance|url=http://www.iais.org.my/e/attach/2015/maqasid2015/pdf/keynote3_ppt.pdf|website=iais.org.my|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani gives as an example the secular law for traffic lights, where ''illat'' (another term of ''fiqh'' meaning "the basic feature of a transaction that causes relevant law to be applied") is obedience to stopping at red lights, and ''hikmah'' is traffic safety -- avoiding vehicle and pedestrian collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Usmani |first1=Muhammad Taqi |title=The Historic Judgment on Interest Delivered in the Supreme Court of Pakistan |publisher=albalagh.net |location=Karachi, Pakistan|url=http://www.albalagh.net/Islamic_economics/riba_judgement.pdf |date=December 1999 |ref=MTUHJI1999 |}}, paras 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1712">'''Hiroto "Hiro" Hirashima''' (July 11, 1910 – November 23, 2007) was a [[Japanese American]] civil rights activist who was pivotal in obtaining [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and privileges for his fellow Japanese American [[Ten-pin bowling|bowlers]], as well as other minorities, at a time when non-caucasians were ineligible for [[American Bowling Congress]] (ABC) membership.

With ABC’s racial barrier finally removed in 1950, Hirashima organized nine teams of [[Nisei]] bowlers for the 1954 ABC Tournament in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Vint, Bill. "Japanese-American pioneer Hiroto Hirashima dies." Article at www.bowl.com, December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he was elected to the ABC board of directors, becoming the first minority to serve on the board. 

Hirashima was inducted into the [[United States Bowling Congress|USBC]] Hall of Fame as an ABC Pioneer in 1995. He is the founder of the Hawaii State Bowling Association and the Oahu Bowling Association. He was honored as an ABC life member in 1995, and served on the ABC Board of Directors for over 30 years.

Born in [[Kaneohe, Hawaii]], he was inducted into the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame by Governor Ben Cayetano in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28594">'''Holism in science''', or '''holistic science''', is an approach to [[research]] that emphasizes the study of [[complex systems]]. Systems are approached as coherent wholes whose component parts are best understood in context and in relation to one another and to the whole. This practice is in contrast to a purely analytic tradition (sometimes called [[Reductionist science|reductionism]]) which aims to gain understanding of systems by dividing them into smaller composing elements and gaining understanding of the system through understanding their elemental properties.&lt;ref name="Alan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Alan|authorlink=Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|title=Unity Of Nature, The: Wholeness And Disintegration In Ecology And Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Oy3CgAAQBAJ|date=4 October 2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holism-reductionism dichotomy is often evident in conflicting interpretations of experimental findings and in setting priorities for future research.

== Overview ==

[[David Deutsch]] calls holism anti-reductionist and refers to the concept as thinking the only legitimate way to think about science is as a series of emergent, or higher level phenomena. He argues that neither approach is purely correct.&lt;ref name="Deutsch2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Deutsch|title=The Fabric of Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7uFxViR19oC|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two aspects of Holism are:

# The way of doing science, sometimes called "whole to parts", which focuses on observation of the specimen within its ecosystem first before breaking down to study any part of the specimen.&lt;ref name="Winther pp. 397–427"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winther | first=Rasmus Grønfeldt | title=Part-whole science | journal=Synthese | volume=178 | issue=3 | date=29 September 2009 | issn=0039-7857 | doi=10.1007/s11229-009-9647-0 | pages=397–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The idea that the scientist is not a passive observer of an external universe but rather a participant in the system.&lt;ref name="Moreira-Munoz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andres Moreira-Munoz|title=Plant Geography of Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmH11ybGdQEC&amp;pg=PA283|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-8748-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic science is naturally suited to subjects such as ecology, biology, physics and the social sciences, where complex, non-linear interactions are the norm. These are systems where emergent properties arise at the level of the whole that cannot be predicted by focusing on the parts alone, which may make mainstream, reductionist science ill-equipped to provide understanding beyond a certain level. This principle of emergence in complex systems is often captured in the phrase ′the whole is greater than the sum of its parts′. Living organisms are an example: no knowledge of all the chemical and physical properties of matter can explain or predict the functioning of living organisms. The same happens in complex social human systems, where detailed understanding of individual behaviour cannot predict the behaviour of the group, which emerges at the level of the collective. The phenomenon of emergence may impose a theoretical limit on knowledge available through reductionist methodology, arguably making complex systems natural subjects for holistic approaches.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Harding|title=Animate Earth: Science, Intuition, and Gaia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEnxfXVwZtUC|date=15 September 2006|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-60358-149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science journalist [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] has expressed this view in the book ''The End of Science''. He wrote that a certain pervasive model within holistic science, [[self-organized criticality]], for example, "is not really a theory at all. Like [[punctuated equilibrium]], self-organized criticality is merely a description, one of many, of the random fluctuations, the noise, permeating nature." By the theorists' own admissions, he said, such a model "can generate neither specific predictions about nature nor meaningful insights. What good is it, then?"&lt;ref name="Horgan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Horgan|title=The End Of Science: Facing The Limits Of Knowledge In The Twilight Of The Scientific Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQOCBgAAQBAJ|date=14 April 2015|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-05085-7|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons that holistic science attracts supporters is that it seems to offer a progressive, 'socio-ecological' view of the world, but [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]]'s book ''The Unity of Nature'' offers evidence to the contrary; suggesting holism in science is not 'ecological' or 'socially-responsive' at all, but regressive and repressive.&lt;ref name="Alan2002"/&gt;

[[Permaculture]] takes a systems level approach to agriculture and land management by attempting to copy what happens in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holistic management (agriculture)|Holistic management]]), integrates [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. It was originally designed as a way to reverse [[desertification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Chrissy|title=Allan Savory: How livestock can protect the land|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/03/10/allan-savory-how-livestock-can-protect-land|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Babita |last2=Ahmed |first2=Naseer |last3=Manish |first3=Thakur |title=ORGANIC FARMING: A HOLISTIC APPROACH TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FRUIT PRODUCTION |journal=European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research |date=November 2016 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=108 – 115 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283578369 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Healey offered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model account of the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting from the operation of a process that violates both spatial and spatiotemporal separability. He argued that, on this interpretation, the nonseparability of the process is a consequence of physical property holism; and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how the correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory or Local Action.&lt;ref name="Healey1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Healey|title=The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: An Interactive Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jc94Da5wmpcC|date=25 January 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40874-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work by Clifton, Dickson and Myrvold cast doubt on whether the account can be squared with relativity theory’s requirement of Lorentz invariance but leaves no doubt of an spatially entangled holism in the theory.&lt;ref name="DieksVermaas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis Dieks|author2=Pieter E. Vermaas|title=The Modal Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHkrBgAAQBAJ|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-011-5084-2|pages=9–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myrvold 2002 pp. 1773–1784"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Myrvold | first=Wayne C. |title=Modal Interpretations and Relativity| journal=Foundations of Physics | volume=32 | issue=11 | year=2002 | issn=0015-9018 | doi=10.1023/a:1021406924313 | pages=1773–1784}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Davies]] and [[John Gribbin]] further observe that [[Wheeler's delayed choice experiment]] shows how the quantum world displays a sort of holism in time as well as space.&lt;ref name="DaviesGribbin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Davies|author2=John Gribbin|title=The Matter Myth: Dramatic Discoveries that Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlmEIGiZ0g4C|date=23 October 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-9091-3|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Holomovement|holistic approach]] of [[David Bohm]], any collection of quantum objects constitutes an indivisible whole within an [[Implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm|implicate and explicate order]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Healey: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/physics-holism/#OHQM ''Holism and Nonseparability in Physics (Spring 2009 Edition)''], Edward N. Zalta (ed.), first published July 22, 1999; substantive revision December 10, 2008, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Section: "Ontological Holism in Quantum Mechanics?" (retrieved June 3, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BohmHiley2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bohm|author2=Basil J. Hiley|title=The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paGIAgAAQBAJ|date=16 January 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80713-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohm said there is no scientific evidence to support the dominant view that the universe consists of a huge, finite number of minute particles, and offered in its stead a view of undivided wholeness: "ultimately, the entire universe (with all its 'particles', including those constituting human beings, their laboratories, observing instruments, etc.) has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status".&lt;ref name="Bohm2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bohm|authorlink=David Bohm|title=Wholeness and the Implicate Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVoh-M36JoAC|date=12 July 2005|page=221|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-43872-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chaos and complexity ====
{{See Also|Chaos theory}}

In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.&lt;ref name="Georgiou2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ion Georgiou|title=Thinking Through Systems Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKKYFyAYriIC&amp;pg=PA50|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-01638-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2O8yppqAmAC&amp;pg=PA130|publisher=PediaPress|page=130|id=GGKEY:A1QP852ZJ8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.&lt;ref name="Gatherer 2010 p=22"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gatherer | first=Derek | title=So what do we really mean when we say that systems biology is holistic? | journal=BMC Systems Biology | volume=4 | issue=1 | year=2010 | issn=1752-0509 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-4-22 | pmid=20226033 | pmc=2850881 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecology ====
{{See also|Holistic community|Ecology}}

[[John Muir]], a Scottish born early American conservationist, wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".&lt;ref name="Gifford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Gifford|title=Reconnecting with John Muir: Essays in Post-Pastoral Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WaK56qGVYIC|date=25 January 2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.&lt;ref name="Looijen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick C. Looijen|title=Holism and Reductionism in Biology and Ecology: The Mutual Dependence of Higher and Lower Level Research Programmes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B03qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-015-9560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medicine ====
{{See Also|Medicine}}

In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively. At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite book |title=Context | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l2O8yppqAmAC&amp;pg=PA135|publisher=PediaPress |page=135|id=GGKEY:A1QP852ZJ8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Systems medicine|systems medicine]] first appeared in 1992 and takes an integrative approach to all of the body and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federoff Gostin p=994"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Federoff | first=Howard J. | last2=Gostin | first2=Lawrence O. | title=Evolving From Reductionism to Holism | journal=JAMA | volume=302 | issue=9 | pages=994–6 | date=2 September 2009 | issn=0098-7484 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurology ====
{{See Also|Neurology}}

A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as the [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance.

==== Architecture ====
{{See Also|Architecture}}

Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise. Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.&lt;ref name="Holm2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivar Holm|title=Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial Design: How Attitudes, Orientations, and Underlying Assumptions Shape the Built Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gi7vcuGpAW8C|year=2006|publisher=Arkitektur- og designhøgskolen i Oslo|isbn=978-82-547-0174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics ====
{{See Also|Economics}}

Some economists use a causal holism theory in their work. That is they view the discipline in the manner of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and claim that it can't be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boylan |first1=Thomas A. |last2=O'Gorman |first2=Pacal F. |title=Causal holism and economic methodology : theories, models and explanation |journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie |date=2001 |pages=395 – 409 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2001-3-page-395.htm |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education reform ====
{{See Also|Education reform}}

The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made" [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney |first1=Davida |title=The Validity of Using Holistic Scoring to Evaluate Writing: A Critical Overview |journal=Research in the Teaching of English |date=February 1984 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=65 – 81 |url=https://www.la.utexas.edu/users/charney/homepage/Articles/Charney_HolisticScoring_1985.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anthropology ====
{{See Also|Anthropology}}

There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref name="SHORE 1999 pp. 5–6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=SHORE | first=BRADD | title=Strange Fate of Holism | journal=Anthropology News | volume=40 | issue=9 | year=1999 | issn=1541-6151 | doi=10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5 | pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="SegalYanagisako2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel A. Segal|author2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dORVd0vwrA4C|date=14 April 2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-8684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Anthropological Holism |url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm |website=anthrobase.com |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Psychology of perception ====
{{See Also|Perception}}

A major holist movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his "Phenomenology of Perception."

==== Teleological psychology ====
{{See Also|Teleology}}

[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

== Skeptical reception ==

According to skeptics, the phrase "holistic science" is often misused by [[pseudoscience]]s. In the book ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' it's noted that "Proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to explain away negative findings. When invoking the mantra, they typically maintain that scientific claims can be evaluated only within the context of broader claims and therefore cannot be evaluated in isolation."&lt;ref name="LilienfeldLynn2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott O. Lilienfeld|author2=Steven Jay Lynn|author3=Jeffrey M. Lohr|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q50gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=12 October 2014|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1-4625-1751-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an invocation of [[Karl Popper]]'s [[demarcation problem]] and in a posting to ''Ask a Philosopher'' [[Massimo Pigliucci]] clarifies Popper by positing, "Instead of thinking of science as making progress by inductive generalization (which doesn’t work because no matter how many times a given theory may have been confirmed thus far, it is always possible that new, contrary, data will emerge tomorrow), we should say that science makes progress by conclusively disconfirming theories that are, in fact, wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|title=Demarcating science from pseudoscience |url=https://askaphilosopher.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/demarcating-science-from-pseudoscience/ |website=askaphilosopher.wordpress.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor J. Stenger]] states that "holistic healing is associated with the rejection of classical, Newtonian physics. Yet, holistic healing retains many ideas from eighteenth and nineteenth century physics. Its proponents are blissfully unaware that these ideas, especially superluminal holism, have been rejected by modern physics as well".&lt;ref name="Stenger2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Stenger|title=Has Science Found God?: The Latest Results in the Search for Purpose in the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhE6ZXCFHZ0C&amp;pg=PA274|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-158-4|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[quantum mysticism|quantum mystics]] interpret the wave function of quantum mechanics as a vibration in a holistic ether that pervades the universe and wave function collapse as the result of some cosmic consciousness. This is a misinterpretation of the effects of quantum entanglement as a violation of relativistic causality and quantum field theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert L.

It is an introduction to the ''why''s of algorithms and data structures.
Features of the book:
#The design factors associated with problems 
#The creative process behind coming up with innovative solutions for [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s
#The line of reasoning behind the constraints, factors and the design choices made.

The very fundamental algorithms portrayed by this book are mostly presented in [[Pseudocode]] and/or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] notation.

'''ISO 8601''' ''Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times'' is an [[international standard]] covering the exchange of [[Calendar date|date]]- and [[time]]-related data. It was issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between [[Date and time notation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.

In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] (and potentially [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]]) calendar, of times based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]] (with optional [[UTC offset]]), of [[Time interval#Time-like concepts: terminology|time intervals]], and combinations thereof.&lt;ref name=scope&gt;ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope&lt;/ref&gt; The standard does not assign any specific meaning to elements of the date/time to be represented; the meaning will depend on the context of its use.  In addition, dates and times to be represented cannot include words with no specified numerical meaning in the standard (e.g., names of [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|years in the Chinese calendar]]) or that do not use [[Character (computing)|characters]] (e.g., images, sounds).&lt;ref name=scope /&gt;

In representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and certain characters (such as "-", ":", "T", "W", and "Z") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as "January" or "Thursday", are not allowed in interchange representations.

==History==
The first edition of the ISO 8601 standard was published as ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: [[ISO 2014]], [[ISO 2015]], [[ISO 2711]], [[ISO 3307]], and [[ISO 4031]].&lt;ref name=doc2004&gt;{{citation
 |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
 |date=2004-12-01
 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
 |quote=Annex A ... From that concept representations of all other date and time values were logically derived; thus, ISO 2014, ISO 3307 and ISO 4031 have been superseded.... Identification of a particular date by means of ordinal dates (ISO 2711) and by means of the week numbering system (ISO 2015) were alternative methods that the basic concept of this International Standard could also encompass; thus, ISO 2015 and ISO 2711 have now been superseded.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been superseded by a second edition ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:2000'' in 2000 and by the current third edition ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:2004'' published on 2004-12-01. ISO 8601 was prepared by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)|date=2004-12-01|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]|at=p. iv Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is under the direct responsibility of, [[List of ISO technical committees|ISO Technical Committee]] TC 154.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53186&amp;published=on TC 154 Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and administration], Technical committees{{spaced ndash}}ISO&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 2014, though superseded, is the standard that originally introduced the all-numeric date notation in most-to-least-significant order {{nowrap|[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]}}. The ISO week numbering system was introduced in ISO 2015, and the identification of days by ordinal dates was originally defined in ISO 2711.

{{anchor|EDTF}}ISO 8601 is currently in the process of being updated and split into two parts anticipated to be released in {{Update after|2019|03|reason=working draft's schedule|text=2019-03}}.

==General principles==
*Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.
*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.

For example, "2004-05" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004.  This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.
*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.

ISO 8601 fixes a reference calendar date to the Gregorian calendar of 20 May 1875 as the date the {{lang|fr|Convention du Mètre}} ([[Metre Convention]]) was signed in [[Paris]]. However, ISO calendar dates before the Convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on {{nowrap|1582-10-15}}. Earlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).

===Years===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| YYYY
|-
| ±&lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;YYYY
|}
ISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]]. However, years prior to [[Gregorian calendar|1583]] are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead "values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)

|at=section 4.1.2.1 General
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)

===Calendar dates===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-MM-DD ||''or''|| YYYYMMDD
|-
| YYYY-MM
| colspan="2"| (''but not'' YYYYMM)
|-
| --MM-DD ||''or''|| --MMDD
|}

Calendar date representations are in the form shown in the adjacent box. [YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31.  For example, "5 April 1981" may be represented as either {{nowrap|"1981-04-05"}}&lt;ref name=isofaqtnd/&gt; in the ''extended format'' or "19810405" in the ''basic format''.

The standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced accuracy.&lt;ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/&gt; For example, one may write {{nowrap|"1981-04"}} to mean "1981 April". The 2000 version allowed writing {{nowrap|"--04-05"}} to mean "April 5"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present. One may simply write "1981" to refer to that year or "19" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive.  Although the standard allows both the YYYY-MM-DD and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]] YYMMDD (still often used).

===Week dates===
{{Main article|ISO week date}}
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-Www ||''or''|| YYYYWww
|-
| YYYY-Www-D ||''or''|| YYYYWwwD
|}
Week date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box.  [YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below).  [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

There are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:
*the week with the year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),
*the week with 4 January in it,
*the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and
*the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December – 4 January.

As a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.

The week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.

The ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.

Examples:
*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written "{{#time: o-"W"W-N|2008-12-29}}"
*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written "{{#time: o-"W"W-N|2010-01-03}}"

===Ordinal dates===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD
|}

An [[ordinal date]] is a simple form for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars.  As represented above, [YYYY] indicates a year. [DDD] is the day of that year, from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|"1981-04-05"}} is also {{nowrap|"1981-095"}}.

This format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance.  This system is sometimes referred to as "Julian Date", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|-4713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year [0000]).

==Times==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|hh:mm:ss.sss
|''or''
|hhmmss.sss
|-
| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss
|-
| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm
|-
| || hh ||
|}

ISO 8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.  The ''basic format'' is [hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is [hh]:[mm]:[ss].
*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to denote midnight at the end of a calendar day).&lt;!--see below--&gt;
*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.
*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).
So a time might appear as either "134730" in the ''basic format'' or "13:47:30" in the ''extended format''.

Either the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased accuracy: [hh]:[mm], [hh][mm] and [hh] are the resulting reduced accuracy time formats.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 Representations with reduced accuracy&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Midnight]]'' is a special case and may be referred to as either "00:00" or "24:00". The notation "00:00" is used at the beginning of a calendar day and is the more frequently used. At the end of a day use "24:00". "2007-04-05T24:00" is the same instant as "2007-04-06T00:00" (see ''[[#Combined date and time representations|Combined date and time representations]]'' below).

Decimal fractions may be added to any of the three time elements. However, a fraction may only be added to the lowest order time element in the representation. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]] (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To denote "14 hours, 30 and one half minutes", do not include a seconds figure. Represent it as "14:30,5", "1430,5", "14:30.5", or "1430.5". There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the [[Significant figures|precision]] of a decimal fraction is 3, i.e., "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190977(v=sql.90).aspx|title=ISO 8601 Format|website=technet.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time zone designators===

{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| &amp;lt;time&amp;gt;Z
|-
| &amp;lt;time&amp;gt;±hh:mm
|-
| &amp;lt;time&amp;gt;±hhmm
|-
| &amp;lt;time&amp;gt;±hh
|}

[[Time zone]]s in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.

If no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.

====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====
If the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. "09:30 UTC" is therefore represented as "09:30Z" or "0930Z". "14:45:15 UTC" would be "14:45:15Z" or "144515Z".

The ''Z'' suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as "Zulu time" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]]. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the "Zulu time" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]&lt;ref name="ACP_121_I"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL ACP 121(I) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 2010 |website= |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formerly used as the international civil time standard. GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community and can refer to either UTC or [[UT1]] depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |title=Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics |authorlink=Dennis D. McCarthy |last=McCarthy |first=Dennis D. |last2=Seidelmann |first2=Kenneth P. |isbn=978-3-527-40780-4 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA]] |location=Weinheim |year=2009 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Time offsets from UTC====
The [[UTC offset|offset from UTC]] is appended to the time in the same way that 'Z' was above, in the form ±[hh]:[mm], ±[hh][mm], or ±[hh].  So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in [[Berlin]] during the winter), the zone designator would be "+01:00", "+0100", or simply "+01". To represent a time behind UTC the offset is negative. For example, the time in [[New York City|New York]] during standard (not daylight saving) hours is [[UTC−05:00]] and the zone designator would then be "&amp;minus;05:00", "&amp;minus;0500", or simply "&amp;minus;05". For other time offsets see [[List of UTC time offsets]]. To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphen&amp;ndash;minus or a [[minus sign]] character. If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&amp;ndash;minus should be used.  [[ASCII]] does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&amp;ndash;minus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. [[Unicode]] has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the [[HTML entity|HTML character entity]] invocation is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;minus;&lt;/code&gt;.

The following times all refer to the same moment: "18:30Z", "22:30+04", "1130&amp;minus;0700", and "15:00&amp;minus;03:30". [[Nautical time]] zone letters are not used with the exception of Z. To calculate UTC time one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for "15:00&amp;minus;03:30" do 15:00 &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.

An offset of zero, in addition to having the special representation "Z", can also be stated numerically as "+00:00", "+0000", or "+00".  However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as "&amp;minus;00:00", "&amp;minus;0000", or "&amp;minus;00".  The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value.  Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of "-00", with the same denotation as "+00" but a differing connotation.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3339{{spaced ndash}}Unknown local offset convention&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 8601 permits the hyphen (-) to be used as the minus (&amp;minus;) character when the character set is limited.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601 &amp;sect;3.4.1 stating, "In an environment where use is made of a character repertoire based on ISO/IEC 646, 'hyphen' and 'minus' are both mapped onto 'hyphen-minus'. Representations with a 'plus-minus' shall only be used in such environment if the interchange repertoire includes 'plus-minus'."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, RFC 3339 explicitly requires the hyphen (-) symbol to represent negative offsets and does not allow for use of the minus (&amp;minus;) symbol.&lt;ref&gt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6 time-numoffset defined with hyphen symbol&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined date and time representations==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;time&amp;gt;
|}

A single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter ''T'' as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, {{nowrap|"2007-04-05T14:30"}}.

If a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example,  "2007-04-05T14:30Z" or "2007-04-05T12:30-02:00".

Either basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced accuracy format.&lt;ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/&gt;  It is permitted to omit the 'T' character by mutual agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=4.3.2 NOTE: By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durations==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS
|-
| PnW
|-
| P&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;time&amp;gt;
|}
Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown to the right.  In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].  Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties.  The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.

*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.
*''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.
*''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.
*''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
*''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds".

Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus "P" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. "PT0S" or "P0D", however, are both valid and represent the same duration. 

To resolve ambiguity, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in "P0.5Y" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in "P0,5Y" or "P0.5Y".  The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their "carry over points" except as noted below.  Thus, "PT36H" could be used as well as "P1DT12H" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that "PT36H" is not the same as "P1DT12H" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].

Alternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}.  For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|"P0003-06-04T12:30:05"}}.  However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the standard describes durations as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section, the duration format is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Java 8 Class Duration|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-|website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Alexa Duration|url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration|website=Amazon Developer|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

|-

|}
A time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section).  The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.

There are four ways to express a time interval:

#Start and end, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
#Start and duration, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M"
#Duration and end, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
#Duration only, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M", with additional context information

Of these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] "/"). Section 4.4.2 of the standard notes that: "In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator instead of a solidus." The standard does not define the term "double hyphen", but previous versions used notations like "2000--2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01| publisher=Hydrogold |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and not allowed in a filename in common operating systems.

For &lt;start&gt;/&lt;end&gt; expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals.  For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as "2007-12-14T13:30/15:30", where "/15:30" implies "/2007-12-14T15:30" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as "2008-02-15/03-14", where "/03-14" implies "/2008-03-14" (the same year as the start).

If greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|"2007-11-13/15"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00"}} includes the start and end times.
To explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|"2007-11-13T00:00/15T24:00"}}.

===Repeating intervals===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| Rnn/&lt;interval&gt;
|-
| R/&lt;interval&gt;
|}
Repeating intervals are specified in clause "4.5 Recurring time interval". They are formed by adding "R[n]/" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions. If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of "P1Y2M10DT2H30M" five times starting at {{nowrap|"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z"}}, use {{nowrap|"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M"}}.

==Truncated representations==
ISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used and the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.

==Usage==
On the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters]&lt;!--should be XML Schema--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]] and [[Internet standard|standards]]. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the [[common era]]. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3339, section 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as "-00:00", which ISO 8601 forbids.  RFC 3339 intends "-00:00" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming "+00:00" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred.  This convention regarding "-00:00" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as [[RFC 2822]] which uses it for timestamps in [[email]] headers.  RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.

ISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=§4|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.

The [[ISO 8601 week date]], as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8006">'''Intellectual opportunism''' is the pursuit of intellectual opportunities with a selfish, ulterior motive not consistent with relevant principles. The term refers to certain self-serving tendencies of the human intellect, often involving professional producers and disseminators of ideas, who work with idea-formation all the time.

Intellectual opportunism sometimes also refers to a specific school or trend of thought, or to a characteristic of a particular intellectual development. Thus, a certain set of people who share ideas are then said to display a tendency for "intellectual opportunism", often with the connotation that they deliberately act intellectually in a certain way, to gain special favor with an authority, group or organization; to justify a state of affairs that benefits themselves; or because they have the motive of financial or personal gain.

==Background==

At issue is the ''motive'' and ''intention'' involved in pursuing, creating, or expressing particular ideas (why certain ideas are being taken up), and the relevant contrast is between: 

* the intellectual's stated principles, versus ideas he publicly or outwardly supports, endorses or concerns himself with.
* the original intention of ideas such as it is normally understood, versus the uses they are put to.

"Theoretical opportunism" in science refers to the attempt to save a theory from refutation, or protect it from criticism, with the use of [[ad hoc]] methods that in some way lack deeper scientific consistency or credibility. Theorists may believe so strongly in the value of their own theory, that they try to explain away inconsistencies or contrary evidence – borrowing any idea that plausibly fits with the theory, rather than developing the theory in such a way, that it can truly account for the relevant evidence.

The phenomenon of intellectual opportunism is frequently associated by its critics with [[careerism]] and dubious, unprincipled self-promotion, where ideas become "just another commodity" or a "bargaining tool". When human knowledge becomes a tradeable good in a market of ideas, all sorts of opportunities arise for huckstering, swindling, haggling and hustling with information in ways which are regarded as unprincipled, dubious or involve deceit of some sort. 

==Morality==
The intellectual opportunist ''adapts'' his intellectual concerns, pursuits and utterances to "fit with the trend/fashion" or "fit the situation" or "with what sells" – with the (ulterior) motive of gaining personal popularity/support, protecting intellectual coherence, obtaining personal credit, acquiring privilege or status, persuading others, ingratiating himself, taking advantage or making money. Normally this assumes some degree of intellectual flexibility, agility or persuasiveness. The intellectual opportunist:

* "Holds his mouth where the money or the support is" or where the opportunities for self-advancement or self-promotion are.
* "Hires out" his own ideas for purposes that conflict with his real nature or the organization he works for, only for the purpose of gaining personal advantage.
* Latches onto any readily available ideas or "picks the brains of others" to advance or defend his own position.
* Compromises what he really believes in, for the sake of some ulterior motive or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quilty, "Political realities and intellectual opportunism." ''The Daily Star'' (Beirut), 19 May 2006.[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/May/19/Political-realities-and-intellectual-opportunism.ashx#axzz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often intellectual opportunism is therefore understood as a sign of lack of [[integrity]] or intellectual shallowness, to the extent that the opportunist is not concerned with the worth of the ideas in themselves, but only with how he can benefit from them himself by pursuing them. As a corollary, the intellectual opportunist is often apt to change his opinions, and "change his line" rapidly or arbitrarily, according to where he can gain personal advantage, in a manner not consistent or principled.  

The implication is usually that ideas are no longer being pursued because of their ''intrinsic merit or worth'', or out of a genuine concern with what is at stake in an argument or idea, but only because of the ''instrumental'' value of ideas, i.e., the selfish advantage that can be gained from pursuing some ideas in preference to other ones. Observably ventilating or "advertising" suitably formulated ideas is then merely a ''means'' or a "tool" for self-advancement or the promotion of a group or organization, giving rise to accusations that the real intention of particular ideas is being twisted around to serve an alien or improper purpose. The general outcome may be that the ideas involved, though plausible at a superficial level, lack any deeper coherence, the coherence being ruled out by lack of regard for relevant principles. Intellectual "dilettantes" (people who do not truly know what they are talking about, i.e. dabblers) are often regarded as opportunists, insofar as they like to side with whatever viewpoint seems to be popular or credible at the time.

==Perception==
Intellectual opportunism may appear obvious or crass, if the selfish motives for engaging in it are clear. It may also be very difficult to detect if: 

*the intellectual opportunist is clever and intelligent, while his audience is not, or his audience lacks sufficient relevant information to "judge the intellectual act". A clever intellectual opportunist may be able to reconcile his changing stories and his ulterior selfish motives in such a way, that his intellectual concerns seem perfectly principled and consistent.
*it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimately seizing an intellectual opportunity with sincere motives, and using an intellectual opportunity for some selfish, ulterior motive.
*the intellectual opportunist is himself ''not aware'' of his own opportunism, i.e. what it means, or what its broader significance is, regarding his own pursuit of intellectual opportunities as perfectly legitimate. In this case, the true motives or the effects of a course of action may be unclear or in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;"...opportunists almost never believe that is what they are. They believe they are making reasonable adjustments to circumstances, and when they do acknowledge that they are doing wrong, we generally note the absence of real guilt in their voices and the worldly smile that tells us they think themselves wrong only by conventional standards, not by the standards of real life." Neal O. Weiner, ''The harmony of the soul: mental health and moral virtue reconsidered.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the relevant and appropriate moral norms are themselves in dispute, so that the validity of the assessment of "opportunism" in intellectual behaviour depends on "point of view".

To ''prove'' intellectual opportunism by an individual or a group may therefore require very comprehensive knowledge pertaining to the case. An additional complicating factor is the influence of cultural differences on human intentions. Behavior regarded as opportunist in one culture may not be so regarded in another because of differences in norms of moral propriety. For example, in American culture there is a much greater preoccupation with self-marketing, advertising and self-promotion, which in European countries might be regarded as crass opportunism, because the culturally appropriate ways to assert self-interest or self-concern are different. There may however be just as much opportunism in Europe as anywhere else, but with a different cultural style. People may say, "all's fair in love and war", but that also means that if one can ''represent'' something as a war or a matter of love, one can justify any action, since love and war permit actions that would ordinarily be regarded as unprincipled or illegitimate.

The '''International Obfuscated C Code Contest''' (abbreviated '''IOCCC''') is a [[computer programming]] contest for the most creatively [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[Source code|code]]. Held annually in the years 1984–1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004–2006, 2011–2015 and then in 2018, it is described as "celebrating [C's] syntactical opaqueness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pcworld.co.nz/pcworld/pcw.nsf/how-to/beyond-the-command-line |accessdate=2013-04-07 |title=Beyond the command line |magazine=PC World Magazine New Zealand |author=Palmer, Geoff |date=November 1, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210081342/http://pcworld.co.nz/pcworld/pcw.nsf/how-to/beyond-the-command-line |archivedate=February 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning code for the 25th contest, held in 2018, was released in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html | title = Previous IOCCC Winners | accessdate = 2014-01-08 | year = 2014 | publisher = IOCCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries are evaluated anonymously by a panel of judges. The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ioccc.org/2015/guidelines.txt | title = 2015 Guidelines | accessdate = 2015-11-20 | year = 2015 | format = plain text | publisher = IOCCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of elimination rounds. By tradition, no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition. Winning entries are awarded with a category, such as "Worst Abuse of the [[C preprocessor]]" or "Most Erratic Behavior", and then announced on the official IOCCC website. The contest states that being announced on the IOCCC website is the reward for winning.

==History==

The IOCCC was started by [[Landon Curt Noll]] and [[Larry Bassel]] in 1984 while employed at National Semiconductor's Genix porting group. The idea for the contest came after they compared notes with each other about some poorly written code that they had to fix, notably the [[Bourne shell]], which used macros to emulate ALGOL 68 syntax, and buggy version of finger for BSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ioccc.org/faq.html | title = FAQ | publisher=IOCCC| accessdate = 2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest itself was the topic of a quiz question in the 1993 [[Computer Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB71B1E74EA9019&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Top Execs Fail To Compute Correctly"]. ''San Jose Mercury News'' (CA). May 15, 1993. Pg. 1A. Via [[Newsbank]]. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hiatus of five years starting in 2006, the contest returned in 2011.&lt;ref name=SJMerc11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/243995/obfuscated_code_contest_returns.html |title=Obfuscated Code Contest Returns |magazine=PCWorld |date=November 15, 2011 |author=Jackson, Joab |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with other programming contests, the IOCCC is described as "not all that serious" by [[Michael Swaine (technical author)|Michael Swaine]], editor of ''[[Dr. Dobbs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/there-must-be-contest/207404123 |title=There Must be Contest | first=Michael | last=Swaine | authorlink=Michael Swaine (technical author) | magazine= [[Dr Dobb's]] |date=May 1, 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

Each year, the rules of the contest are published on the IOCCC website. Rules vary from year to year and are posted with a set of guidelines that attempt to convey the spirit of the rules.

::"Hacking the contest rules is a tradition". ''Landon Curt Noll, 2011.''&lt;ref name=SJMerc11/&gt;

The rules are often deliberately written with loopholes that contestants are encouraged to find and abuse.{{fact|date=April 2017}} Entries that take advantage of loopholes can cause the rules for the following year's contest to be adjusted.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Obfuscations employed==

Entries often employ strange or unusual tricks, such as using the C preprocessor to do things it was not designed to do, or avoiding commonly used constructs in the C programming language in favor of much more obscure ways of achieving the same thing. Two contest winners generated a list of prime numbers using the C preprocessor "spectacularly", according to ''Dr. Dobbs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/code-finessing/193104882?pgno=2 |title=Code Finessing |magazine=[[Dr Dobb's]] |author= Spinellis, Diomidis |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some quotes from 2004 winners include:

{{quote|text=To keep things simple, I have avoided the C preprocessor and tricky statements such as "if", "for", "do", "while", "switch", and "goto".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/2004/burley.hint IOCCC 2004 – Best Calculated Risk]. IOCCC. Retrieved 2013-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=We still aren't sure whether or not this is a useful program, but it's the first atomic fission we've seen in the IOCCC.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/2004/jdalbec.hint IOCCC 2004 – Best abuse of the Periodic table]. IOCCC. Retrieved 2013-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=Why not use the program to hide another program in the program? It must have seemed reasonable at the time.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/2004/sds.hint IOCCC 2004 - Best abuse of Indentation]. IOCCC. Retrieved 2013-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=The program implements an 11-bit [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] in the [[C preprocessor]].&lt;ref name="cpp_abuse"&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/2004/vik2.hint IOCCC 2004 - Best Abuse of CPP]'' IOCCC. Retrieved 2013-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=I found that calculating prime numbers up to 1024 makes the program include itself over 6.8 million times.''&lt;ref name="cpp_abuse" /&gt;}}

Contributions have included source code formatted to resemble images, text, etc., after the manner of [[ASCII art]], preprocessor redefinitions to make code harder to read, and [[self-modifying code]]. In several years, an entry was submitted that required a new definition of some of the rules for the next year.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This is regarded as a high honor. An example is the world's shortest [[Quine (computing)|self-reproducing program]]. The entry was a program designed to output its own source code, and which had zero bytes of source code. When the program ran, it printed out zero bytes, equivalent to its source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ioccc.org/1994/smr.hint| title = smr.hint| year = 1994| format = plain text| publisher = IOCCC| accessdate = 2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the effort to take obfuscation to its extremes, contestants have produced programs which skirt around the edges of C standards, or result in constructs which trigger rarely used code path combinations in compilers. As a result, several of the past entries may not compile directly in a modern compiler, and some may cause crashes.

==Examples==
Within the code size limit of only a few kilobytes, contestants have managed to do complicated things&amp;nbsp;– a 2004 winner turned out an operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ioccc.org/2004/gavin.hint| title = gavin.hint3| year = 2004| format = plain text| publisher = IOCCC| accessdate = 2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toledo Nanochess===
''Toledo Nanochess'' is a [[chess engine]] developed by Mexican Oscar Toledo Gutiérrez, a five-time winner of the IOCCC. In accordance with IOCCC rules, it is 1255 characters long. The author claims that it is the world's smallest chess program written in C.

The source code for ''Toledo Nanochess'' and other engines is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanochess.org/chess3.html Toledo Nanochess and Toledo Picochess]&lt;/ref&gt;
Because ''Toledo Nanochess'' is based on Toledo's winning entry from the 18th IOCCC (Best Game&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioccc.org/2005/whowon.html Who won the 18th IOCCC]&lt;/ref&gt;), it is heavily [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/bormand/nanochess Nanochess partially de-obfuscated version]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2014, the author published the book ''Toledo Nanochess: The commented source code'', which contains the fully commented source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toledo Nanochess: The commented source code|isbn=978-1-304-86437-6|first=Oscar|last=Toledo Gutiérrez|year=2014|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 7, 2010, it appears to be one of only two chess engines written in less than 2 kilobytes of C that are able to play full legal chess moves, along with ''Micro-Max'' by Dutch physicist H. G. Muller. In 2014 the 1 kilobyte barrier has been broken by ''Super Micro Chess''&lt;ref&gt;http://smmax.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt; – a derivative of Micro-Max – totaling 760 characters (spaces and newlines included).&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/smmax/sm-fide%20760.c Super Micro FIDE 760]&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller version, ''Toledo Picochess'', consisting of 944 non-blank characters, also exists.

{{Jain philosophy}}
'''Jaina seven-valued logic''' is system of [[argumentation]] developed by [[Jainism|Jaina]] [[philosopher]]s and thinkers to support and substantiate their theory of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. This argumentation system has  seven distinct  semantic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s which may be thought of as seven different [[truth value]]s. Traditionally, in the Jaina and other Indian literature dealing with topics in [[Jain philosophy]], this system of argumentation is referred to as ''Saptabhangivada'' or ''[[Syadvada]]''.  The earliest reference to ''Syadvada'' occurs is the writings of [[Bhadrabahu]] (c. 433–357 BCE). There is mention of ''Syadvada'' in the ''Nyayavatara'' of Siddhasens Divakara (about 480–550 CE). Samantabhadra (about 600 CE) gave a full exposition of the seven parts of ''Syadvada'' or ''Saptabhanginyaya'' in his ''Aptamimamsa''. The ''Syadvadamanjari'' of Mallisena (1292 CE) is a separate treatise on the same theory. There are, of course, still later works and  a large number of  modern commentaries.&lt;ref name=PCM&gt;{{cite web|last1=P.C. Mahalanobis|title=The Indian-Jaina Dialectic of Syadvad in Relation to Probability (I)|url=http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/firstep-2/indianjaina-1-1.htm|website=Jain World|accessdate=28 November 2016}} (Dialectica 8, 1954, 95–111)&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of Saptabhangivada as a [[Many-valued logic|seven-valued logic]] was attempted by [[Harvard University]] philosophy professor George Bosworth Burch (1902–1973) in a paper published in International Philosophical Quarterly in the year 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George Bosworth Burch|title=Seven-Valued Logic in Jain Philosophy|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|date=February 1964|volume=4|issue=1|pages=68–93|doi=10.5840/ipq19644140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]], an Indian applied statistician, has given a [[probability|probabilistic]] interpretation of the ''Saptabhangivada''.&lt;ref name=PCM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=P.C. Mahalanobis|title=The Indian-Jaina Dialectic of Syadvad in Relation to Probability (II)|url=http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/firstep-2/indianjaina-1-2.htm|website=Jain World|accessdate=28 November 2016}} (Dialectica 8, 1954, 95–111)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The seven predicates==
The ''Saptabhangivada'', the seven predicate theory may be summarized  as follows:&lt;ref name=Ganeri&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonardon Ganeri|title=Jaina Logic and the Philosophical Basis of Pluralism|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|date=2002|volume=23|pages=267 –281|url=https://www.academia.edu/2146233/Jaina_Logic_and_the_Philosophical_Basis_of_Pluralism_2002_|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven predicate theory consists in the use of seven claims about sentences, each preceded by "arguably" or "conditionally" (syat), concerning a single object and its particular properties, composed of assertions and denials, either simultaneously or successively, and without contradiction. These seven claims are the following.

# Arguably, it (that is, some object) exists (''syad asty eva''). 
# Arguably, it does not exist (''syan nasty eva''). 
# Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist (''syad asty eva syan nasty eva''). 
# Arguably, it is non-assertible (''syad avaktavyam eva''). 
# Arguably, it exists; arguably, it is non-assertible (''syad asty eva syad avaktavyam eva''). 
# Arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably, it is non-assertible (''syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva''). 
# Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably it is non-assertible (''syad asty eva syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva'').

There are three basic truth values, namely, true (t), false (f) and unassertible (u). These are combined to produce four more truth values, namely, tf, tu, fu, and tfu. Though, superficially, it appears that there are only three distinct truth values a deeper analysis of the Jaina system reveals that the seven truth values are indeed distinct. This is a consequence of the conditionalising operator "arguably" denoted in Sanskrit by the word ''syat''. This Sanskrit word has the literal meaning of "perhaps it is", and it is used to mean "from a certain standpoint" or "within a particular philosophical perspective".

In this discussion the term "standpoint" has been used in a technical sense. Consider a situation in which a globally inconsistent set of propositions, the totality of philosophical discourse, is divided into sub-sets, each of which is internally consistent. Any proposition might be supported by others from within the same sub-set. At the same time, the negation of that proposition might occur in a distinct, though possibly overlapping subset, and be supported by other propositions within it. Each such consistent sub-set of a globally inconsistent discourse, is what the Jainas call a "standpoint" (naya). A standpoint corresponds to a particular philosophical perspective.&lt;ref name=Ganeri/&gt;

In this terminology, it can be seen that the seven predicates get translated to the following seven possibilities. Each proposition ''p'' has the following seven states:&lt;ref name=Ganeri/&gt;

# ''p'' is a member of every standpoint in ''S''.
# Not-''p'' is a member of every standpoint in ''S''.
# ''p'' is a member of some standpoints, and Not-''p'' is a member of the rest.
# ''p'' is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral.
# Not-''p'' is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral.
# ''p'' is neutral with respect to every standpoint.
# ''p'' is a member of some standpoints and Not-''p'' is a member of some other standpoints, and the rest are neutral.

==Life and career==
Lewin grew up in [[Maui]] and obtained her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Architecture and [[Computer Aided Design]] from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], later obtaining her [[Master of Professional Studies|M.P.S.]] degree in Interactive Design from [[Tisch School of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="CBS Denver" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah" /&gt;

Her most known work, ''The Pool'', featured on ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'',&lt;ref name="Wired feature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senese|first1=Mike|title=SXSW’s Maker Takeover Flashes, Then Fizzles|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/03/sxsws-maker-takeover/|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of over 200 [[LED]]-lit platforms that change colours ...according to pressure and speed changes elicited by viewers' interactions with the system.&lt;ref name="CBS Denver"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadusky|first1=Heather|title=We Are Still The Wild West: TEDx Invigorates Denver|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/06/14/we-are-still-the-wild-west-tedx-invigorates-denver/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS Denver|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|last1=D’Addario|first1=Daniel|title=Pop Chart|url=http://time.com/3706715/pop-chart/|website=Time|publisher=Time|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ALDINÇ|first1=Burcu|title=Both young and old to be enchanted by light artwork|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2015/10/05/both-young-and-old-to-be-enchanted-by-light-artwork|website=Daily Sabah|publisher=Daily Sabah|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termed an "interactive light sculpture", where human interaction is necessary for its display, this installation has toured several countries.&lt;ref name="Palm Beach Daily News install"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjostrom|first1=Jan|title=Light up the night: Interactive installation to illuminate waterfront|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local/light-up-the-night-interactive-installation-to-ill/nmTn7/|website=Palm Beach Daily News|publisher=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in works that involve technology and human interaction, she often includes musical elements into her creations. For instance, other projects or hers include [[laser harp]]s, where people elicit music via interrupting the laser arrangements.&lt;ref name="CBS Denver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulder Weekly2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moutinho|first1=Amada|title=Out of the Box|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-14249-out-of-the-box.html|website=Boulder Weekly|publisher=Boulder Weekly|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times-Picayune"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacCash|first1=Doug|title=Voodoo Fest 2009 puts an emphasis on the visual|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoofest/index.ssf/2009/10/voodoo_experience_2009_puts_an.html|website=The Times-Picayune|publisher=The Times-Picayune|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medium" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Boulder Weekly]]'', [[Google]] commissioned Lewin to "create an Android app for tracking feedback between her innovations and the groups of people interacting with them".&lt;ref name="Boulder Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosler|first1=Cayte|title=Art in a digital world|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-11238-art-in-a-digital-world.html|website=Boulder Weekly|publisher=Boulder Weekly|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin, along with her ''Pool'' installation, was featured by the [[BBC News]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dailey|first1=Kate|last2=Bressanin|first2=Anna|last3=Shnitser|first3=Ilya|title=Jen Lewin: Artist dazzles with light-and-sound installations|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22487281|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Khitan scripts''' were the writing systems for the now-extinct [[Mongolic languages#Para-Mongolic|Para-Mongolic]] [[Khitan language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian.|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the 10th-12th century by the [[Khitan people]] who had established the [[Liao dynasty]] in [[Northeast China]]. There were two scripts, the [[Khitan large script|large script]] and the [[Khitan small script|small script]]. These were functionally independent and appear to have been used simultaneously. The Khitan scripts continued to be in use to some extent by the [[Jurchen people]] for several decades after the fall of the Liao dynasty until the Jurchens fully switched to a [[Jurchen script|script of their own]].  Examples of the scripts appeared most often on [[epitaph]]s and [[monument]]s, although other fragments sometimes surface.

Many scholars recognize that the Khitan scripts have not been fully [[Decipherment|deciphered]] and that more research and discoveries would be necessary for a proficient understanding of them.&lt;ref name=daniels&gt;{{Citation|last=Daniels|first=Peter T.|last2=Bright|first2=William|publication-date =1996|title =The World’s Writing Systems|publication-place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages =230–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kara&gt;{{Citation|last=Kara|first= György|publication-date=1987|title= On the Khitan Writing Systems|periodical=Mongolian Studies|series=10|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khitan scripts are part of the [[Chinese family of scripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp028_chinese_scripts.html|title=The Family of Chinese Character-Type Scripts (Twenty Members and Four Stages of Development)|surname=Zhou|given=Youguang|author-link=Zhou Youguang|editor-given=Victor H.|editor-surname=Mair|editor-link=Victor H.

Knowledge of the Khitan language, which was written by the Khitan script, is quite limited as well. Although there are several clues to its origins, which might point in different directions, the Khitan language shares an ancestor with the Mongolian languages but is not one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yanningmuzhi.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Memorial for Yelü Yanning in Khitan large script. Dated 986.]]
The Khitan large script was considered to be relatively simple.  The large script characters were written equally spaced, in vertical columns, in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|the same way]] as the Chinese has been traditionally written.  Although large script mostly uses [[logogram]]s, it is possible that [[ideogram]]s and [[Syllabary|syllabograms]] are used for [[Grammar|grammatical]] functions.  The large script has a few similarities to [[Chinese character|Chinese]], with several words taken directly with or without modifications from the Chinese (e.g. characters 二,三,十,廿,月,日, which appear in dates in the apparently bilingual ''Xiao Xiaozhong muzhi''  inscription from Xigushan, [[Huludao|Jinxi]], [[Liaoning Province]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Most large script characters, however, cannot be directly related to any Chinese characters. The meaning of most of them remains unknown, but that of a few of them (numbers, symbols for some of the  [[Wu Xing|five elements]] and the [[Earthly Branches|twelve animals]] that the Khitans apparently used to designate years of the [[sexagenary cycle]]) has been established by analyzing dates in Khitan inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has long been controversy as to whether a particular monument belong to the large or small script,&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;
there are several monuments (steles or fragments of stelae) that the specialists at least tentatively identify as written in the Khitan large script. However, one of the first inscriptions so identified (the ''Gu taishi mingshi ji'' epitaph, found in 1935) has been since lost, and the preserved [[Gravestone rubbing|rubbings]] of it are not very legible; moreover, some believe that this inscription was a forgery in the first place. In any event, the total of about 830 different large-script characters are thought to have been identified, even without the problematic ''Gu taishi mingshi ji''; including it, the character count rises to about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Memorial for Yelü Yanning]] (dated 986 CE) is one of the earliest inscriptions in Khitan large script.

==Small script==
{{Main| Khitan small script }}
The Khitan small script was invented in about 924 or 925 CE by a scholar named [[Yelü Diela]].  He drew his inspiration from “the [[Uyghur language]] and script,”&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt; which he was shown by a visiting Uyghur ambassador at the Khitan court.  For this reason, Khitan small script was originally thought to be a daughter script of the [[Uyghur alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=based%20on%20uighur%20script&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=354|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a smaller number of symbols than large script, small script was less complex, yet still “able to record any word.”&lt;ref name=kara/&gt; While small-script inscriptions employed some logograms as well, most words in small script were made using a blocked system reminiscent of the later [[Hangul]] writing of [[Korea]], meaning that a word is represented by one group (square block) composed of several [[glyph]]s with individual phonetic meanings (somewhat similar to the ''[[Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]'' units of Hangul). Unlike Hangul's ''jamo'', a Khitan phonetic symbol could represent not just a single vowel or consonant, but a CV or VC pair as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each block could incorporate two to seven such "phonetic element" characters, written in pairs within the block, with the first half of the pair on the left.  If there were an odd number of characters in a block, the unpaired character would be centered below the preceding pair.

Although there is some speculation, it appears there are no characters that both scripts share.  Periodically, epitaphs written using small script will be written using the large script method of [[linear]]ity{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. &lt;!-- what was that supposed to mean? --&gt; Although small script had some similarities to Chinese, Khitan characters were often used to record Chinese words.  The appearance of a likeness between a small script and a Chinese character does not aide in the reading of Khitan.  For example, the  Chinese character for ‘mountain’(山) is the same as the Khitan small script logogram for ‘gold’(and, thus, the name of the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]]).&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 378 known small script characters, 125 are [[Semantics|semantic]], 115 are [[Phonetics|phonetic]], and the remainder have not been deciphered.&lt;ref name=kara/&gt;  (Usually, it was possible to guess the phonetic value of an element if it has been used to transcribe a Chinese loanword in a Khitan inscription; otherwise, such phonetic values are hard to determine, as very little of the Khitan language is known.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;)
Small script uses a mixture of logograms, syllabograms, and, as some as sources claim, a few single sound [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]].  Sometimes [[suffix]]es were written with syllabograms, just as single syllables sometimes were written with three syllabograms (with one each for the initial, medial, and final sounds of the syllable).  Sometimes the initial [[consonants]] of syllables are indicated to be [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[guttural]], or [[Nasal stop|nasal]] etc., based on the syllabograms involved.  Additionally, [[vowels]] are sometimes indicated to be labial or non-labial, or [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] in the front or back of the mouth.

Much of this information came from the "Khitan Script Research Group", led by the [[Inner Mongolia|Mongolian]] scholar named [[Chinggeltei|Činggeltei]], &lt;!-- (清格尔泰, born 06.1924) --&gt; who used monuments, [[Chinese calendar|calendar]], and similar Chinese texts to decipher sections of small script.&lt;ref&gt;According to Kane (1989) (p. 13), the most complete publication on the Khitan small script as of that time was the book by Činggeltei et al. (1985). It contained the complete corpus of inscriptions in that script known to date, summary of research done on the subject in China and elsewhere, and a complete bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly valuable object of their study was the inscription on the ''Da Jin huangdi dotong jinglüe langjun xingji'' (大金皇帝都统经略郎君行记) stele, which is the only known bilingual Chinese-Khitan inscription. Produced during the Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]], it was originally (before the discovery of other Khitan inscriptions in 1922) thought to be in [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]].&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 4-5, 13-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurchen==
{{main|Jurchen script}}
Some of the characters of the [[Jurchen script]]s have similarities to Khitan large script.  According to some sources, the discoveries of inscriptions on monuments and epitaphs give clues to the connection between Khitan and Jurchen.&lt;ref name=kiyose&gt;{{Citation|last=Kiyose|first=Gisaburo N.|publication-date =1985|title= The Significance of the New Kitan and Jurchen Materials|periodical=Papers in East Asian Languages|pages=75–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of the Liao Dynasty, the Khitan (small-character) script continued to be used by the Jurchen people for a few decades, until fully replaced with Jurchen script and, in 1191,  suppressed by [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|imperial]] order.&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=khitan%20script%20big%20characters&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=359|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corpus ==
{{main|List of Khitan inscriptions}}

[[File:Small Khitan Fish Tally.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bronze 'fish tally' with small Khitan inscription owned by [[Stephen Wootton Bushell]]]]
There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy written by Tao Zongyi (陶宗儀) during the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are about 17 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan large script, ranging in date from 986 to 1176, and about 33 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171.  The two scripts are mutually exclusive (never occurring together on the same monument), but it is not known why the Khitan people used two different scripts, or what determined the choice of which script to use.

In addition to monumental inscriptions, short inscriptions in both Khitan scripts have also been found on tomb murals and rock paintings, and on various portable artefacts such as mirrors, amulets, [[paiza]] (tablets of authority given to officials and envoys), and special non-circulation coins.  A number of bronze official [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] with the seal face inscribed in a convoluted [[seal script]] style of Khitan characters are also known.

A {{nihongo|'''''kōan'''''|公案}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|.|ɑː|n}}; {{zh|c=公案|p=gōng'àn}}, {{IPAc-cmn|g|ong|1|-|an|4}}; {{lang-ko|공안}} ''gong-an''; {{lang-vi|công án}}) is a [[narrative|story]], [[dialogue]], question, or statement which is used in [[Zen]] practice to provoke the "great doubt" and test a student's progress in Zen practice.

==Etymology==
The Japanese term ''kōan'' is the [[on'yomi|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the Chinese word ''gong'an'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:公案|公案]]|p=gōng'àn|w=''kung-an''|l=public case}}). The term is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] word, consisting of the [[Chinese character|characters]] {{lang|zh|[[wikt:公|公]]}} "public; official; governmental; common; collective; fair; equitable" and {{lang|zh|[[wikt:案|案]]}} "table; desk; (law) case; record; file; plan; proposal."

According to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] Zen master [[Zhongfeng Mingben]] ({{lang|zh|中峰明本}} 1263–1323), ''gōng'àn'' originated as an abbreviation of ''gōngfǔ zhī àndú'' ({{lang|zh|公府之案牘}}, Japanese ''kōfu no antoku''—literally the ''andu'' "official correspondence; documents; files" of a ''gongfu'' "government post"), which referred to a "public record" or the "case records of a public law court" in [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China.{{sfn|Sasaki|1965|p=4-6}}{{sfn|Foulk|2000|p=21-22}}{{refn|group=note|Assertions that the literal meaning of ''kung-an'' is the table, desk, or bench of a magistrate appear on page 18 of Foulk 2000. See also {{sfn|McRae|2003|p=172–173, note 16}}}} ''Kōan/gong'an'' thus serves as a [[metaphor]] for principles of reality beyond the private opinion of one person, and a teacher may test the student's ability to recognize and understand that principle.

Commentaries in kōan collections bear some similarity to judicial decisions that cite and sometimes modify precedents. An article by T. Griffith Foulk claims
{{quote|...Its literal meaning is the 'table' or 'bench' ''[[An (Shintō)|an]]'' of a 'magistrate' or 'judge' ''[[gong (title)|kung]]''.{{sfn|Foulk|2000|p=21–22}}}}

''Gong'an'' was itself originally a metonym—an article of furniture involved in setting legal precedents came to stand for such precedents. For example, ''Di Gong'an'' ({{lang|zh|狄公案}}) is the original title of ''[[Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee]]'', the famous Chinese [[detective novel]] based on a historical Tang dynasty judge. Similarly, Zen kōan collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen masters and disciples attempting to pass on their teachings.

==Origins and development==

===China===

====Commenting on old cases====
Gong'ans developed during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907){{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=111}} from the recorded sayings collections of Chán-masters, which quoted many stories of "a famous past Chán figure's encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students, and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings.

Those stories came to be known as gongan, "public cases".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán-master.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master's position as an awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=1109}}

====Literary practice====
Koan practice developed from a literary practice, styling snippets of encounter-dialogue into well-edited stories. It arose in interaction with "educated literati".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=131}} There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as ascribing specific meanings to the cases.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=131}} Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'', for the hindrance it had become to study of Chán by his students.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=20}} Kōan literature was also influenced by the pre-Zen Chinese tradition of the "literary game"—a competition involving improvised poetry.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=Chapter 4}}

The style of writing of Zen texts has been influenced by "a variety of east Asian literary games":{{sfn|Heine|2008|p=52}}
{{quote|
#The extensive use of [[allusion]]s, which create a feeling of disconnection with the main theme;
#Indirect references, such as titling a poem with one topic and composing a verse that seems on the surface to be totally unrelated;
#Inventive wordplay based on the fact that [[Hanzi]] (Chinese characters) are homophonic and convey multiple, often complementary or contradictory meanings;
#Linking the verses in a sustained string based on hidden points of connection or continuity, such as seasonal imagery or references to myths and legends.{{sfn|Heine|2008|p=52}}}}

====Observing the phrase====
During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297) the use of gongans took a decisive turn. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163){{refn|group=note|{{lang|zh|大慧宗杲}}; Wade-Giles: ''Ta-hui Tsung-kao''; Japanese: ''Daie Sōkō''}} introduced the use of ''kanhua'', "observing the phrase". In this practice students were to observe (''kan'') or concentrate on a single word or phrase (''huatou''), such as the famous ''mu'' of the [[Mu (negative)|mu-koan]].{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=22}}

In the eleventh century this practice had become common.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=111}} A new literary genre developed from this tradition as well. Collections of such commented cases were compiled which consisted of the case itself, accompanied by verse or prose commentary.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=110}}

Dahui's invention was aimed at balancing the [[Vipassana|insight]] developed by reflection on the teachings with developing [[samatha]], calmness of mind.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=23}} Ironically, this development became in effect ''silent illumination'',{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=208}} a "[re-absorbing] of koan-study into the "silence" of meditation (''ch'an'')".{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=209}} It led to a rejection of Buddhist learning:
{{quote|Some extent of Buddhist learning could easily have been recognized as a precondition for [[Subitism|sudden awakening]] in Chan. Sung masters, however, tended to take the rejection literally and nondialectically. In effect, what they instituted was a form of Zen fundamentalism: the tradition came to be increasingly anti-intellectual in orientation and, in the process, reduced its complex heritage to simple formulae for which literal interpretations were thought adequate.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=209–210}}}}

This development left Chinese Chan vulnerable to criticisms by neo-Confucianism, which developed after the Sung Dynasty. Its anti-intellectual rhetoric was no match for the intellectual discourse of the neo-Confucianists.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=210–211}}

====Interaction====
The recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student:
{{quote|The essence of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] came to be identified with the interaction between masters and students. Whatever insight [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] might bring, its verification was always interpersonal. In effect, enlightenment came to be understood not so much as an insight, but as a way of acting in the world with other people{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=30}}}}

This mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model:
{{quote|One looked at the enlightened activities of one's lineal forebears in order to understand one's own identity [...] taking the role of the participants and engaging in their dialogues instead{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=130}}{{refn|group=note|This role-taking is described by the Swedish psychologist of religion [[Hjalmar Sundén]], though McRae does not seem to be aware of this}}}}

Kōan training requires a qualified teacher who has the ability to judge a disciple's depth of attainment. In the [[Rinzai school|Rinzai Zen school]], which uses kōans extensively, the teacher certification process includes an appraisal of proficiency in using that school's extensive kōan curriculum.

====Contemporary koan-use====
In China and Korea, "observing the phrase" is still the sole form of koan-practice, though [[Seung Sahn]] used the Rinzai-style of koan-practice in his [[Kwan Um School of Zen]].{{sfn|Lachs|2012}}

===Japan===
Japanese Zen, both Rinzai and [[Sōtō]], took over the use of koan-study and commenting. In Sōtō-Zen, koan commentary was not linked to seated meditation.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}}

====Koan manuals====
When the Chán-tradition was introduced in Japan, Japanese monks had to master the Chinese language and specific expressions used in the koan-training. The desired "spontaneity" expressed by enlightened masters required a thorough study of Chinese language and poetry.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=92–93}} Japanese Zen imitated the Chinese "syntax and stereotyped norms".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=93}}

In the officially recognized monasteries belonging to the [[Five Mountain System|Gozan]] (Five Mountain System) the Chinese system was fully continued. Senior monks were supposed to compose Chinese verse in a complex style of matched counterpoints known as ''bienli wen''. It took a lot of literary and intellectual skills for a monk to succeed in this system.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}}

The [[Five Mountain System#The Rinka|Rinka-monasteries]], the provincial temples with less control of the state, laid less stress on the correct command of the Chinese cultural idiom. These monasteries developed "more accessible methods of koan instruction".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}} It had three features:{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}}
#A standardized koan-curriculum;
#A standardized set of answers based on stereotypes Chinese sayings;
#A standardized method of secretly guiding students through the curriculum of koan and answers.

By standardizing the koan-curriculum every generation of students proceeded to the same series of koans.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}} Students had to memorize a set number of stereotyped sayings, ''agyō'', "appended words".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=96–97}} The proper series of responses for each koan were taught by the master in private instruction-sessions to selected individual students who would inherit the dharma lineage.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=97–98}}

''Missanroku'' and ''missanchō'', "Records of secret instruction" have been preserved for various Rinzai-lineages. They contain both the koan-curricula and the standardized answers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=98}}{{refn|group=note|In 1916 Tominaga Shūho, using the pseudonym "Hau Hōō", published a critique of the Rinzai koan-system, ''Gendai sōjizen no hyōron'', which also contained a translation of a ''missanroku''. The missanroku part has been translated by [[Yoel Hoffmann]] as ''"The Sound of the One Hand"'' (see {{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}).{{sfn|Bodiford|1993|p=264, note 29}}}} In Sōtō-Zen they are called ''monsan'', an abbreviation of ''monto hissan'', "secret instructions of the lineage".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=98}} The ''monsan'' follow a standard question-and-answer format. A series of questions is given, to be asked by the master. The answers are also given by the master, to be memorized by the student.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=102–106}}

====Contemporary koan curricula====
In the eighteenth century the Rinzai school became dominated by the legacy of [[Hakuin]], who laid a strong emphasis on koan study as a means to gain [[kensho]] and develop insight.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} There are two curricula used in Rinzai, both derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai: the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum.{{sfn|Hori|2000}} According to [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], "the koans and their standard answers are fixed."{{sfn|Samy|p=4}}

====Suppression in the Sōtō-school====
During the late eighteenth and nineteenth century the tradition of koan-commentary became suppressed in the Sōtō-school, due to a reform movement that sought to standardise the procedures for [[dharma transmission]].{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} One reason for suppressing the koan-tradition in the Sōtō-school may have been to highlight the differences with the Rinzai-school, and create a clear identity.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} This movement also started to venerate [[Dogen]] as the founding teacher of the Sōtō-school. His teachings became the standard for the Sōtō-teachings, neglecting the fact that Dogen himself made extensive use of koan-commentary.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}}

==Doctrinal background==
The popular western understanding sees ''kōan'' as referring to an unanswerable question or a [[meaningless statement]]. However, in Zen practice, a kōan is not meaningless, and not a riddle or a puzzle. Teachers do expect students to present an appropriate response when asked about a kōan.{{sfn|Sasaki|1965|p=xi}}{{sfn|Hagen|2000}}{{sfn|Aitken|1991|p=xiii, 26, and 212}} {{sfn|Loori|1994|p=p64}}

Koans are also understood as pointers to an unmediated "Pure Consciousness", devoid of cognitive activity.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=282}} Victor Hori criticizes this understanding:
{{quote|[A] pure consciousness without concepts, if there could be such a thing, would be a booming, buzzing confusion, a sensory field of flashes of light, unidentifiable sounds, ambiguous shapes, color patches without significance. This is not the consciousness of the enlightened Zen master.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=284}}}}

According to Hori, a central theme of many koans is the 'identity of opposites':{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
{{quote|[K]oan after koan explores the theme of nonduality. Hakuin's well-known koan, "Two hands clap and there is a sound, what is the sound of one hand?" is clearly about two and one. The koan asks, you know what duality is, now what is nonduality? In "What is your [[original face]] before your mother and father were born?" the phrase "father and mother" alludes to duality. This is obvious to someone versed in the Chinese tradition, where so much philosophical thought is presented in the imagery of paired opposites. The phrase "your original face" alludes to the original nonduality.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}}}

Comparable statements are: "Look at the flower and the flower also looks"; "Guest and host interchange".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289}}

==Koan-practice==
Study of kōan literature is common to all schools of Zen, though with varying emphases and curricula.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=35-43}} The Rinzai-school uses extensive koan-curricula, checking questions, and ''jakogo'' ("capping phrases", quotations from Chinese poetry) in its use of koans.{{sfn|Hori|2006}} The [[Sanbo Kyodan]], and its western derivates of [[Taizan Maezumi]] and the [[White Plum Asanga]], also use koan-curricula, but have omitted the use of capping phrases.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=35-43}} In [[Chinese Chán]] and Korean Seon, the emphasis is on [[Hua Tou]], the study of one koan throughout one's lifetime.{{sfn|Lachs|2012}} In Japanese Sōtō-Zen, the use of koans has been abandoned since the late eighteenth and nineteenth century.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=245}}

===Hua-tou or breakthrough-koan===
In the Rinzai-school, the Sanbo Kyodan, and the White Plum Asanga, koan practice starts with the assignment of a ''hosshi'' or "break-through koan", usually the [[Mu (negative)#The Mu-koan|mu-koan]] or "the sound of one hand clapping".{{sfn|Hori|2000}} In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, various koan can be used for the hua-tou practice.

Students are instructed to concentrate on the "word-head", like the phrase "mu". In the Wumenguan (Mumonkan), public case #1 ("Zhaozhou's Dog"), Wumen (Mumon) wrote:
{{quote|... concentrate yourself into this 'Wú' ... making your whole body one great inquiry. Day and night work intently at it. Do not attempt nihilistic or dualistic interpretations."{{sfn|Shibayama|1974}}}}

Arousing this great inquiry or "Great Doubt" is an essential element of kōan practice. It builds up "strong internal pressure (''gidan''), never stopping knocking from within at the door of [the] mind, demanding to be resolved".{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138–139}} To illustrate the enormous concentration required in kōan meditation, Zen Master Wumen commented,
{{quote|It is like swallowing a red-hot iron ball. You try to vomit it out, but you can't.}}

Analysing the koan for its literal meaning won't lead to insight, though understanding the context from which koans emerged can make them more intelligible. For example, when a monk asked Zhaozhou (Joshu) "does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?", the monk was referring to the understanding of the teachings on [[Buddha-nature]], which were understood in the Chinese context of absolute and relative reality.{{sfn|Shibayama|1974|p=Commentary on case #1}}{{sfn|Swanson|1997}}{{refn|group=note|The controversy over whether all beings have the potential for enlightenment is even older. Vigorous controversy still surrounds the matter of Buddha nature. See "Tao-sheng's Theory of Sudden Enlightenment", Whalen Lai, in ''Sudden and Gradual'' (subtitle) ''Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'', p. 173 and 191. The latter page documents how in 429 or thereabouts (more than 400&amp;nbsp;years before Zhaozhou), Tao-sheng was expelled from the Buddhist monastic community for defending the idea that incorrigible persons (''icchantika'') do indeed have Buddha-nature (''fo-hsing'').}}

===Insight===
The continuous pondering of the break-through koan (''shokan''{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=132}}) or [[Hua Tou]], "word head",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} leads to [[kensho]], an initial insight into "seeing the [[Buddha-nature|(Buddha-)nature]].{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}

The aim of the break-through koan is to see the "nonduality of subject and object":{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
{{quote|The monk himself in his seeking is the koan. Realization of this is the insight; the response to the koan [...] Subject and object - this is two hands clapping. When the monk realizes that the koan is not merely an object of consciousness but is also he himself as the activity of seeking an answer to the koan, then subject and object are no longer separate and distinct [...] This is one hand clapping.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=288-289}}}}

Various accounts can be found which describe this "becoming one" and the resulting breakthrough:
{{quote|I was dead tired. That evening when I tried to settle down to sleep, the instant I laid my head on the pillow, I saw: "Ah, this outbreath is Mu!" Then: the in-breath too is Mu!" Next breath, too: Mu! Next breath: Mu, Mu! "Mu, a whole sequence of Mu! Croak, croak; meow, meow - these too are Mu! The bedding, the wall, the column, the sliding-door - these too are Mu! This, that and everything is Mu! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha Ha! that roshi is a rascal! He's always tricking people with his 'Mu, Mu, Mu'!...{{sfn|Satomi|King|1993|p=106}}{{refn|group=note|Maura O'Halloran also gives an account of herself becoming mu.{{sfn|O'Halloran|2007|p=78}}}}}}

But the use of the mu-koan has also been criticised. According to [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], the main aim is merely to "'become one' with the koan".{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} Showing to have 'become one' with the first koan is enough to pass the first koan.{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} According to Samy, this is not equal to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]:
{{quote|The one-pointed, non-intellectual concentration on the hua-t’ou (or Mu) is a pressure-cooker tactics, a reduction to a technique which can produce some psychic experiences. These methods and techniques are forced efforts which can even run on auto-pilot. They can produce experiences but not prajana wisdom. Some speak of ‘investigating’ the hua-t’ou, but it is rather a matter of concentration, which sometimes can provide insights, yet no more than that.{{sfn|Samy|p=5}}}}

===Testing insight - or learning responses===

====Sassho – Checking questions====
Teachers may probe students about their kōan practice using ''sassho'', "checking questions" to validate their [[satori]] (understanding) or [[kenshō|kensho]] (seeing the nature).{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=132–133}} For the ''mu-koan'' and the ''clapping hand-koan'' there are twenty to a hundred checking questions, depending on the teaching lineage.{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=133}} The checking questions serve to deepen the insight of the student, but also to test his or her understanding.{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=133}}

Those checking questions, and their answers, are part of a standardised set of questions and answers.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}}{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} Students are learning a "ritual performance",{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}} learning how to behave and response in specific ways,{{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}}{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} learning "clever repartees, ritualized language and gestures and be submissive to the master’s diktat and arbitration."{{sfn|Samy|p=5}}

====Jakugo – Capping phrases====
In the Rinzai-school, passing a koan and the checking questions has to be supplemented by ''[[jakugo]]'', "capping phrases", citations of Chinese poetry to demonstrate the insight.{{sfn|Hori|1999}}{{sfn|Hori|2003}} Students can use collections of those citations, instead of composing poetry themselves.{{sfn|Hori|1999}}{{sfn|Hori|2003}}

===Post-satori practice===
After the initial insight [[Kenshō#Training after kenshō|further practice]] is necessary, to deepen the insight and learn to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}} In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, this further practice consists of further pondering of the same Hua Tou.&lt;ref group=web name="Lachs" /&gt; In Rinzai-Zen, this further practice is undertaken by further koan-study, for which elaborate curriculae exist.{{sfn|Hori|2000}}{{sfn|Hori|2005b}} In Sōtō-Zen, [[Shikantaza]] is the main practice for deepening insight.

==Varieties in koan-practice==

===Chinese Chán and Korean Seon===
{{Main|Hua Tou}}

In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, the primary form of Koan-study is ''kanhua'', "reflection on the koan",{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=168}} also called [[Hua Tou]], "word head".{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} In this practice, a fragment of the koan, such as "''mu''", or a "what is"-question is used by focusing on this fragment and repeating it over and over again:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dharmanet.org/samples/chansample2.htm Dharmanet, ''Huatou'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lachs|2012}}
{{quote|Who is it who now repeats the Buddha's name?&lt;br&gt;
Who is dragging this corpse about?&lt;br&gt;
What is this?&lt;br&gt;
What is it?&lt;br&gt;
What was the original face before my father and mother were born?&lt;br&gt;
Who am I?&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/en/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html hsuyun.org, ''The Hua-Tou Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The student is assigned only one hua-tou for a lifetime.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} In contrast to the similar-sounding "who am I?" question of [[Ramana Maharshi]], hua-tou involves raising "great doubt":&lt;ref group=web name="Lachs"&gt;[http://www.nondualitymagazine.org/nonduality_magazine.2.stuartlachs.interview.htm Nonduality Magazine (2010), ''Interview with Stuart Lachs'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This koan becomes a touchstone of our practice: it is a place to put our doubt, to cultivate great doubt, to allow the revelation of great faith, and to focus our great energy.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}}}}

===Japanese Rinzai===
Kōan practice is particularly important among Japanese practitioners of the Rinzai sect.

====Importance of koan-study====
This importance is reflected in writings in the Rinzai-school on the koan-genre. [[Zhongfeng Mingben]]{{efn|group=note|{{lang|zh|中峰明本}}, Wade Giles: ''Chung-feng Ming-pen''; Japanese ''Chūhō Myōhon''}} (1263–1323),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=155}} a Chinese [[Chinese Chán|Chán-master]] who lived at the beginning of the [[Yuan Dynasty]], revitalized the Rinzai-tradition,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} and put a strong emphasis on the use of koans. He saw the kung-ans as "work of literature [that] should be used as objective, universal standards to test the insight of monks who aspired to be recognized as Ch'an masters":{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=22}}
{{quote|The koans do not represent the private opinion of a single man, but rather the hundreds and thousands of [[bodhisattva]]s of the [[Trailokya|three realms]] and [[Ten spiritual realms|ten directions]]. This principle accords with the spiritual source, tallies with the mysterious meaning, destroys birth-and-death, and transcends the passions. It cannot be understood by logic; it cannot be transmitted in words; it cannot be explained in writing; it cannot be measured by reason. It is like the poisoned drum that kills all who hear it, or like a great fire that consumes all who come near it. What is called "the special transmission of the Vulture Peak" was the transmission of this; what is called the "direct pointing of [[Bodhidharma]] at Shao-lin-ssu" is this.{{sfn|Mingben|2006|p=13}}}}

[[Musō Soseki]] (1275–1351), a Japanese contemporary of Zhongfeng Mingben, relativized the use of koans.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}} The study of koans had become popular in Japan, due to the influence of Chinese masters such as Zhongfeng Mingben. Despite belonging to the Rinzai-school, Musō Soseki also made extensive use of ''richi'' (teaching), explaining the sutras, instead of ''kikan'' (koan). According to Musō Soseki, both are ''upaya'', "skillful means" meant to educate students.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}} Musō Soseki called both ''shōkogyu'', "little jewels", tools to help the student to attain [[satori]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}}{{refn|group=note|The term ''shōkogyu'' comes from a Chinese poem in which a lady calls the attendant using the word ''xiaoyu'', Jap. ''shōkogyu'', to warn her lover.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=165}} The poem figures in an interaction between [[Wuzi Fayan]] (1024–1104) and his student [[Yuanwu Keqin]], the teacher of [[Dahui Zonggao]]. Yüan-wu was assigned the koan "The verbal and the nonverbal are like vines clinging to a tree". Yuanwu gained [[satori]] with the phrase "She keeps calling out to [her maid] ''Xiaoyu'' although there is nothing the matter.{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=186}} It is only because she knows Tanlang [her lover] will hear her voice".{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=198 note 96}} The same koan was assigned to Dahui Zonggao.{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=197 note 94}}}}

====Koan curricula====
In Rinzai a gradual succession of koans is studied.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}} There are two general branches of curricula used within Rinzai, derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai: the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum.  However, there are a number of sub-branches of these, and additional variations of curriculum often exist between individual teaching lines which can reflect the recorded experiences of a particular lineage's members.  Koan curricula are, in fact, subject to continued accretion and evolution over time, and thus are best considered living traditions of practice rather than set programs of study.

Koan practice starts with the ''shokan'', or "first barrier", usually the mu-koan or the koan "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=132}} After having attained ''kensho'', students continue their practice investigating subsequent koans.{{sfn|Yampolski|2005|p=186}} In the Takuju-school, after breakthrough students work through the ''Gateless Gate'' (Mumonkan), the ''Blue Cliff Record'' (Hekigan-roku), the ''Entangling Vines'' (Shumon Kattoshu), and the ''Collection of Wings of the Blackbird'' ({{lang|ja|鴆羽集}}, ''Chin'u shū'').{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} The Inzan-school uses its own internally generated list of koans.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}}

Hakuin's descendants developed a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}}
#''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentitated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=136–137}}
#''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=137}}
#''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=138}}
#''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans:{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}
#*Miura and Sasaki:
#**Nansen's Flower (Hekigan-roku Case 40)
#**A Buffalo Passes the Window (Mumonkan Case 38)
#**Sōzan's Memorial Tower (Kattō-shō Case 140)
#**Suigan's Eyebrows (Hekigan-roku Case 8)
#**Enkan's Rhinoceros Fan (Hekigan-roku Case 91)
#*Shimano:
#**The Old Woman Burns the Hut (Kattō-shō Case 162)
#*Asahina Sōgen:
#**Goso Hōen's "Hakuun Said 'Not Yet'" (Kattō-shō Case 269)
#**Shuzan's Main Cable (Kattō-shō Case 280).
#*Akizuki:
#**Nansen Has Died (Kattō-shō Case 282)
#**Kenpō’s Three Illnesses (Kattō-shō Case 17).
#''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=135}}

According to [[Akizuki Ryomin|Akizuki]] there was an older classification-system, in which the fifth category was ''Kojo'', "Directed upwards". This category too was meant to rid the monk of any "stink of Zen".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} The very advanced practitioner may also receive the ''Matsugo no rokan'', "The last barrier, and ''Saigo no ikketsu'', "The final confirmation".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} "The last barrier" when one left the training hall, for example "Sum up all of the records of Rinzai in one word!"{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} It is not meant to be solved immediately, but to be carried around in order to keep practising.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} "the final confirmation" may be another word for the same kind of koan.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}}

====Post-satori practice====
Completing the koan-curriculum in the Rinzai-schools traditionally also led to a mastery of Chinese poetry and literary skills:
{{quote|[D]isciples today are expected to spend a dozen or more years with a master to complete a full course of training in koan commentary. Only when a master is satisfied that a disciple can comment appropriately on a wide range of old cases will he recognize the latter as a dharma heir and give him formal "proof of transmission" (J. ''[[inka shomei]]''). Thus, in reality, a lot more than ''satori'' is required for one to be recognized as a master (J. ''shike'', ''roshi'') in the Rinzai school of Zen at present. The accepted proof of ''satori'' is a set of literary and rhetorical skills that takes many years to acquire.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=42}}}}

After completing the koan-training, ''Gogo no shugyo'', post-satori training is necessary:{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=145}}
{{quote|[I]t would take 10&amp;nbsp;years to solve all the kōans [...] in the sōdō. After the student has solved all koans, he can leave the sōdō and live on his own, but he is still not considered a roshi. For this he has to complete another ten years of training, called "go-go-no-shugyō" in Japanese. Literally, this means "practice after satori/enlightenment", but [[Keido Fukushima|Fukushima]] preferred the translation "special practice". Fukushima would explain that the student builds up a "religious personality" during this decade. It is a kind of period that functions to test if the student is actually able to live in regular society and apply his koan understanding to daily life, after he has lived in an environment that can be quite surreal and detached from the lives of the rest of humanity. Usually, the student lives in small parish temple during this decade, not in a formal training monastery.&lt;ref name=antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Breathing practices====
[[Hakuin Ekaku]], the 17th&amp;nbsp;century revitalizer of the Rinzai school, taught several practices which serve to correct physical and mental imbalances arising from, among other things, incorrect or excessive koan practice.  The "soft-butter" method (''nanso no ho'') and "introspection method" (''naikan no ho'') involve cultivation of [[Qi|ki]] centered on the [[tanden]] (Chinese:[[dantian]]).  These practices are described in Hakuin's works [[Orategama]] and [[Yasen Kanna]], and are still taught in some Rinzai lineages today.

===Japanese Sōtō===
Though few Sōtō practitioners concentrate on kōans during meditation, the Sōtō sect has a strong historical connection with kōans, since many kōan collections were compiled by Sōtō priests.

During the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Dōgen]], founder of the Sōtō sect in Japan, quoted 580 kōans in his teachings.{{sfn|Bodiford|1993|p=144}} He compiled some 300 kōans in the volumes known as the Greater [[Shōbōgenzō]]. Dōgen wrote of Genjokōan, which points out that everyday life experience is the fundamental kōan.

However, according to Michel Mohr,
{{quote|...kōan practice was largely expunged from the Sōtō school through the efforts of [[Gentō Sokuchū]] (1729–1807), the eleventh abbot of Entsuji, who in 1795 was nominated abbot of [[Eiheiji]]".{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=245}}}}

===Sanbo Kyodan and White Plum Asanga===
The [[Sanbō Kyōdan|Sanbo Kyodan]] school and the [[White Plum Asanga]], which originated with the Sōtō-priest [[Hakuun Yasutani]], incorporates koan-study. The Sanbo kyodan places great emphasis on [[kensho]], initial insight into one's true nature,{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} as a start of real practice. It follows the so-called Harada-Yasutani koan-curriculum, which is derived from [[Hakuin]]'s student Takuju. It is a shortened koan-curriculum, in which the socalled "capping phrases" are removed. The curriculum takes considerably less time to study than the Takuju-curriculum of Rinzai.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42–43}}

To attain kensho, most students are assigned the mu-koan. After breaking through, the student first studies twenty-two "in-house"{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} koans, which are "unpublished and not for the general public",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} but are nevertheless published and commented upon.{{sfn|MacInnes|2007}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.mkzc.org/foreword-to-flowing-bridge-the-miscellaneous-koans/ Ruben L. F. Habito (2007), ''Foreword to Flowing Bridge: The Miscellaneous Koans'']&lt;/ref&gt; There-after, the students goes through the ''Gateless Gate'' (Mumonkan), the ''Blue Cliff Record'', the ''Book of Equanimity'', and the ''Record of Transmitting the Light''.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} The koan-curriculum is completed by the [[Dongshan Liangjie#Five Ranks|Five ranks of Tozan]] and the precepts.{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=432}}

==Classical kōan collections==
Kōans collectively form a substantial body of literature studied by Zen practitioners and scholars worldwide. Kōan collections commonly referenced in English include:
*The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: ''Bìyán Lù''; Japanese: ''Hekiganroku''), 12th century;
*The ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' (also known as the ''Book of Serenity''; Chinese: ''Cóngróng Lù''; Japanese: ''Shoyoroku''), 12th century;
*''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (also known as ''The Gateless Barrier''; Chinese: ''Wúménguān''; Japanese: ''Mumonkan'') collected during the 13th&amp;nbsp;century).
In these and subsequent collections, a terse "main case" of a kōan often accompanies prefatory remarks, poems, proverbs and other phrases, and further commentary about prior emendations.

===The Blue Cliff Record===
The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|碧巖錄}} Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] ({{lang|zh|圜悟克勤}} 1063–1135).

===The Book of Equanimity===
The ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' or ''Book of Serenity'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|從容録}} Cóngróng lù; Japanese: {{lang|ja|従容録}} Shōyōroku) is a collection of 100 Kōans by [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (Chinese: {{lang|zh|宏智正覺}}; Japanese: Wanshi Shōgaku) (1091–1157), compiled with commentaries by [[Wansong Xingxiu]] (1166–1246). The full title is ''The Record of the Temple of Equanimity With the Classic Odes of Venerable Tiantong Jue and the Responsive Commentary of Old Man Wansong'' {{lang|zh|萬松老評唱天童覺和尚 頌古從容庵錄}} (Wansong Laoren Pingchang Tiantong Jue Heshang Songgu Congrong An Lu) (Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 48, No. 2004)

===The Gateless Gate===
''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|無門關}} Wumenguan; Japanese: Mumonkan) is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk [[Wumen]] ({{lang|zh|無門}}) (1183–1260). The title may be more accurately rendered as ''Gateless Barrier'' or ''Gateless Checkpoint'').

Five kōans in the collection derive from the sayings and doings of [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], (transliterated as Chao-chou in Wade-Giles and pronounced Jōshū in Japanese).

===The True Dharma Eye===
''[[Shinji Shōbōgenzō|The True Dharma Eye 300]]'' ([[Shōbōgenzō]] Sanbyakusoku) is a collection of 300 kōans compiled by [[Eihei Dōgen]].
Upon arriving in China, Dogen Kigen first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably came into contact with [[Dahui Zonggao]]s (大慧宗杲) (1089–1163) Shōbōgenzō, the ''Zhengfayan zang'' (正法眼藏), "Treasury of the true dharma eye" (W-G.: Cheng-fa yen-tsang, J.: Shōbōgenzō) a collection of koans and dialogues compiled between 1147 and 1150 by [[Dahui Zonggao]] . Dahui's Shōbōgenzō is composed of three scrolls prefaced by three short introductory pieces. The Zongmen liandeng huiyao 宗門聯燈會要 was compiled in 1183 by Huiweng Wuming 晦翁悟明 (n.d.), three generations after Dahui in the same line; the sermon is found in zh 20 (x 79: 173a).

Other kōan collections compiled and annotated by Sōtō priests include:
*''The Iron Flute'' (Japanese: ''Tetteki Tosui'', compiled by Genro in 1783)
*''Verses and Commentaries on One Hundred Old Cases of Tenchian'' (Japanese: ''Tenchian hyakusoku hyoju'', compiled by Tetsumon in 1771.)

==Examples of traditional kōans==
&lt;!-- Note to editors: the list in this section should not attempt to interpret the meanings --&gt;

===Does a dog have Buddha-nature===
{{Main|Mu (negative)}}

{{quote|A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen|Zhàozhōu]], "Does a dog have [[Buddha nature]] or not?" Zhaozhou said, "[[Mu (negative)|Wú]]".}}

("Zhaozhou" is rendered as "Chao-chou" in [[Wade-Giles]], and pronounced "Joshu" in Japanese. "Wu" appears as "mu" in Japanese, meaning "no", "not", "nonbeing", or "without" in English. This is a fragment of Case #1 of the ''[[The Gateless Gate|Wúménguān]]''. However, another koan presents a longer version, in which Zhaozhou answered "yes" in response to the same question asked by a different monk: see Case #18 of the ''Book of Serenity''.)

===The sound of one hand===
{{quote
|text=''Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?'' ({{lang|ja|隻手声あり、その声を聞け}})
|sign=[[Hakuin Ekaku]]
}}

Victor Hori comments:
{{quote|...in the beginning a monk first thinks a kōan is an inert object upon which to focus attention; after a long period of consecutive repetition, one realizes that the kōan is also a dynamic activity, the very activity of seeking an answer to the kōan. The kōan is both the object being sought and the relentless seeking itself. In a kōan, the self sees the self not directly but under the guise of the kōan ... When one realizes ("makes real") this identity, then two hands have become one. The practitioner becomes the kōan that he or she is trying to understand. That is the sound of one hand.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/Bulletin_and_Shoho/pdf/23-Hori.pdf G. Victor Sogen Hori (1999), ''Translating the Zen Phrase Book''. Nanzan Bulletin 23, 1999, p. 44–58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Original Face===
{{Main|Original face}}

[[Huineng|Huìnéng]] asked [[Hui Ming]], "Without thinking of good or evil, show me your original face before your mother and father were born." (This is a fragment of case #23 of the ''Wumenguan''.)

===Killing the Buddha===
{{quote
|text=''If you meet the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], kill him.'' ({{lang|zh|逢佛殺佛}})
|sign=[[Linji Yixuan|Linji]]
}}

Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity is delusion, not awakening. One must destroy the preconception of the Buddha as separate and external before one can become internally as their own Buddha. Zen master [[Shunryu Suzuki]] wrote in ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'' during an introduction to [[Zazen]],
{{quote|Kill the Buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature.}}

One is only able to see a Buddha as he exists in separation from Buddha; the mind of the practitioner is thus still holding onto apparent duality.

===Other koans===
*A student asked Master Yun-Men (A.D. 949) "Not even a thought has arisen; is there still a sin or not?" Master replied, "[[Mount Sumeru]]!"
*A monk asked [[Dongshan Shouchu]], "What is Buddha?" Dongshan said, "Three pounds of [[flax]]." (This is a fragment of case #18 of the ''Wumenguan'' as well as case #12 of the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.)
*A monk asked Zhaozhou, "What is the meaning of the ancestral teacher's (i.e., [[Bodhidharma]]'s) coming from the west?" Zhaozhou said, "The cypress tree in front of the hall." (This is a fragment of case #37 of the ''Wumenguan'' as well as case #47 of the ''Book of Serenity''.)

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= e^\rho\cos\theta, \\
  y &amp;= e^\rho\sin\theta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By using complex numbers &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = x + iy'&lt;/math&gt;, the transformation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; x + iy = e^{\rho + i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

I.e., it is given by the complex exponential function.

====From bipolar coordinates====

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= a \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \\
  y &amp;= a \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From 2-center bipolar coordinates====
{{Main|two-center bipolar coordinates}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \frac{1}{4c}\left(r_1^2 - r_2^2\right) \\
  y &amp;= \pm \frac{1}{4c}\sqrt{16c^2 r_1^2 - (r_1^2 - r_2^2 + 4c^2)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From Cesàro equation====
{{Main|Cesàro equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \int \cos \left[\int \kappa(s) \,ds\right] ds \\
  y &amp;= \int \sin \left[\int \kappa(s) \,ds\right] ds
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===To polar coordinates===
====From Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
  \theta^\prime &amp;= \arctan\left|\frac{y}{x}\right|
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note: solving for &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; returns the resultant angle in the first quadrant (&lt;math&gt;0&lt;\theta&lt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). To find &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, one must refer to the original Cartesian coordinate, determine the quadrant in which &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; lies (ex (3,-3) [Cartesian] lies in QIV), then use the following to solve for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;:

*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QI:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QII:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta= \pi - \theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QIII:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi + \theta^\prime &lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QIV:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi - \theta^\prime &lt;/math&gt;

The value for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; must be solved for in this manner because for all values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta&lt;/math&gt; is only defined for &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;\theta&lt;+\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and is periodic (with period &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;). This means that the inverse function will only give values in the domain of the function, but restricted to a single period. Hence, the range of the inverse function is only half a full circle.

Note that one can also use
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
  \theta^\prime &amp;= 2 \arctan \frac{y}{x + r}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From 2-center bipolar coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       r &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2c^2}{2}} \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan \left[\sqrt{\frac{8c^2(r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2c^2)}{r_1^2 - r_2^2} - 1}\right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 2''c'' is the distance between the poles.

===To log-polar coordinates from Cartesian coordinates===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \rho &amp;= \log\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan \frac{y}{x}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Arc-length and curvature===
====In Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \kappa &amp;= \frac{x'y'' - y'x''}{({x'}^2 + {y'}^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \\
       s &amp;= \int_a^t \sqrt{{x'}^2 + {y'}^2}\, dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====In polar coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \kappa &amp;= \frac{r^2 + 2{r'}^2 - rr''}{(r^2 + {r'}^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \\
       s &amp;= \int_a^\phi \sqrt{r^2 + {r'}^2}\, d\phi
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==3-dimensional==
Let (x, y, z) be the standard Cartesian coordinates, and (ρ, θ, φ) the [[spherical coordinates]], with θ the angle measured away from the +Z axis (as [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Spherical.svg], see conventions in [[spherical coordinates]]). As φ has a range of 360° the same considerations as in polar (2 dimensional) coordinates apply whenever an arctangent of it is taken. θ has a range of 180°, running from 0° to 180°, and does not pose any problem when calculated from an arccosine, but beware for an arctangent. 

If, in the alternative definition, ''θ'' is chosen to run from −90° to +90°, in opposite direction of the earlier definition, it can be found uniquely from an arcsine, but beware of an arccotangent. In this case in all formulas below all arguments in ''θ'' should have sine and cosine exchanged, and as derivative also a plus and minus exchanged.

All divisions by zero result in special cases of being directions along one of the main axes and are in practice most easily solved by observation.

Note: this section needs updating for consistency with nomenclature. A diagram should be included for this article showing what each variable represents. Usually \theta represents the polar angle for spherical coordinates and \phi the azimuthal angle for cylindrical coordinates. Here the two are mixed and could cause confusion. Someone please update.  [respeonse] Note that the conventions in physics and pure mathematics differ.  This page should probably distinguish this issue itself, as is stated clearly on the wikipedia page for spherical coordinate system.

A '''love–hate relationship''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] involving simultaneous or alternating [[emotion]]s of [[love]] and [[hate]]—something particularly common when [[emotion]]s are intense.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used frequently in [[psychology]], popular writing, and [[journalism]]. It can be applied to [[Object sexuality|relationships with inanimate objects]], or even [[concept]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10553024 | work=The Economist | title=A love-hate relationship | date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-10281561-250.html|title=Skyhook's love/hate relationship with GPS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of a [[Romantic love|romantic]] nature or between [[Sibling relationship|siblings]] and parents/children.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Skura, ''Shakespeare the Actor'' (1993) pp. 286–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological roots==
A love–hate relationship has been linked to the occurrence of emotional [[ambivalence]] in early childhood;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; to conflicting responses by different [[Transactional analysis|ego states]] within the same person;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or to the inevitable co-existence of [[Psychological egoism|egoistic]] conflicts with the object of love.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narcissism|Narcissists]] have been seen as particularly prone to aggressive reactions towards love objects,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) pp. 24–5&lt;/ref&gt; not least when issues of self-identity are involved:&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; in extreme instances, hate at the very existence of the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] may be the only emotion felt, until love breaks through behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) pp. 85–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Yale University]] suggests love–hate relationships may be the result of poor [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/the-mystery-behind-love-hate-relationships-10767.html|title=The mystery behind love-hate relationships - ScienceBlog.com|date=8 June 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrities==

The term is sometimes employed by writers to refer to relationships between celebrity couples who have been divorced, then who reunite (notably [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]], or [[Eminem]] and Kimberly Scott), as well as to their relationship with fame itself.&lt;ref&gt;Skura, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

A love–hate relationship may develop when people have completely lost the [[intimacy]] within a loving relationship, yet still retain some [[passion (emotion)|passion]] for, or perhaps some [[promise|commitment]] to, each other, before degenerating into a hate–love relationship leading to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pam and J. Pearson, ''Splitting Up'' (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship==

[[Tony Blair#Gordon Brown|Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]'s political friendship took on at times all the characteristics of a love–hate relationship, if one between friends and allies.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair Unbound'' (2007) p. 546 and 574&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] warned of the conflicts that can arise from conflicting claims within friendships.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 281-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

*The Japanese word "[[tsundere]]" comes from two words—tsuntsun (aloof, irritable, cold) and deredere (lovestruck). A tsundere character is one who frequently switches between insulting their love interest and acting lovestruck or kind toward them. Tsundere characters usually belittle their love interest at first but eventually become kinder to them over time.
*[[Catullus]] introduced the love–hate theme into Western culture with his famous lines: "I hate and yet love. You may wonder how I manage it. I don't know, but feel it happen, and am in torment".&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman et al eds, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;
*The concept of a love–hate relationship is frequently used in teen [[romance novels]] where two characters are shown to "hate" each other, but show some sort of affection or attraction towards each other at certain points of the story.

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014.

The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

==Examples of existing MAC curves==
Various economists, research organizations, and consultancies have produced MAC curves.

The [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] produced several marginal abatement cost curves for Germany (also called Cost Potential Curves), depending on the perspective (end-user, utilities, society).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epub.wupperinst.org/files/5015/5015_EE_EDL_en.pdf Options and Potentials for Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services, Wuppertal Institute, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical sorting''' (sometimes called '''digital sorting''') is the automated process of [[sorting]] solid products using [[cameras]] and/or [[lasers]].

Depending on the types of sensors used and the software-driven intelligence of the [[image processing]] system, optical sorters can recognize objects' color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sun|first=Da-Wen|title=Computer Vision Technology for Food Quality Evaluation|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-373642-0|pages=600|url=http://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-vision-technology-for-food-quality-evaluation/sun/978-0-12-373642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorter compares objects to user-defined accept/reject criteria to identify and remove defective products and foreign material (FM) from the production line, or to separate product of different grades or types of materials.

[[File:SortingPotatoStrips.jpg|thumb|Optical sorting achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes.]]  
Optical sorters are in widespread use in the [[food industry]] worldwide, with the highest adoption in processing harvested foods such as potatoes, fruits, vegetables and nuts where it achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The technology is also used in [[pharmaceutical manufacturing]] and [[nutraceutical]] manufacturing, tobacco processing, [[waste recycling]] and other industries. Compared to manual sorting, which is subjective and inconsistent, optical sorting helps improve product quality, maximize throughput and increase yields while reducing labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Joseph Irudayaraj|Irudayaraj]]|first=Joseph|title=Nondestructive Testing of Food Quality|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2885-5|pages=384|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813828856.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sorting system ==

In general, optical sorters feature four major components: the feed system, the optical system, image processing software and the separation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=M|title=Detecting Foreign Bodies in Food|year=2004|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd.|isbn=1 85573 729 9|pages=328|url=http://www.woodheadpublishing.com/en/book.aspx?bookID=614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of the feed system is to spread product into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system, usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products like whole potatoes, pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while good product continues along its normal trajectory.

The ideal sorter depends on the application, with the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determining the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.

== Sensors ==
Optical sorters require a compatible combination of light and sensors to illuminate objects and capture images of the objects before the images can be processed and accept/reject decisions made.

There are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of cameras and lasers on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[spectrum]]s. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.

=== Cameras ===

[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]] Monochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.

Sophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.

Coupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object. They use high beam infrared laser beams to show the laser on the beam.

=== Lasers ===

While cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to interrogate a material's structural properties in addition to determining differences in color. This structural property inspection capability makes lasers ideal for detecting a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic, even if they are the same color as the good product, and for separating various materials at waste recycling facilities.

Lasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light, within the visible spectrums and beyond. For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths, a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. 'hongxing') using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=December 2010|volume=101|pages=402–408|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camera/laser combinations ===

Sorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal. 
 
=== Hyperspectral imaging ===

[[File:Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips shows invisible defects]] Driven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgstaller|first=Markus|author2=Groinig, Marcus|title=Spectral Imaging Sorts 'Sugar-End' Defects|journal=Vision Systems Design|date=February 2012|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].

== Software-driven intelligence ==
Once the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.

Object-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.

New software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.

== Platforms ==
The considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product – large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize – and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.

=== Channel sorters ===

The simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.

For products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.

=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters ===

As the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.

=== Belt Sorters ===

[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]] Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.

=== ADR systems ===

A fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.

=== Single-file inspection systems ===

The platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.

=== Mechanical graders ===

For products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.

== Debate and public attention ==

=== Support ===

In a 1996 article "Abortion and Fathers' Rights,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven D. Hales|authorlink1=Abortion and Fathers' Rights|editor1-last=Humber|editor1-first=James|title=REPRODUCTION, TECHNOLOGY, AND RIGHTS|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|isbn=978-1-4757-6403-1|pages=5–26|format=Biomedical Ethics Reviews|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher Steven Hales made an argument that presupposes the following assertions:

# That women have an absolute right to abortion on demand;
# That men and women have equal moral rights and duties and should have equal legal right and duties; and
# That parents have a moral duty to support their children once they are born and legal duties of support should supervene on this moral duty.

Hales contends that the conjunction of these three principles is prima facie inconsistent and that this inconsistency should be eradicated by firstly acknowledging that men have no absolute duty to provide material support for their children, and secondly by admitting that fathers have the right of refusal.

[[Laurie Shrage]], professor of philosophy and women’s and gender studies, questions whether men should be 'penalized for being sexually active', and she puts the subject in the perspective of feminists who had to fight the same idea with different gender portent, namely that consenting to sexual intercourse is not the same as consenting to parenthood. Furthermore, both men and children are punished, according to professor Shrage; children have to live with an absent father who never 'voluntarily' became a parent.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shrage | first=Laurie | title=Is Forced Fatherhood Fair? | website=Opinionator | date=2013-06-12 | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/ | accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper abortion has met opposition by those who see it as an excuse for men to shirk their responsibilities as a father.&lt;ref name=PolitkenA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/profiler/bob/ECE2182043/aldrig-har-maend-udstillet-sig-selv-mere-kaellingeagtigt/|title=Aldrig har mænd udstillet sig selv mere kællingeagtigt|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Never have men exhibited themselves more hag-like }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gudme (2016)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gudme |first1=Maria |last2=Dyrkjær |first2=Maja Vedel |title=Fædre skal tage ansvar for børn - ikke kræve juridisk abort |trans-title=Fathers must take responsibility for children - does not require legal abortion |language=Danish |date=2016-02-04 |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |department=Debate |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/ECE3050409/faedre-skal-tage-ansvar-for-boern---ikke-kraeve-juridisk-abort/ |access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that men should use birth control (either contraception or sterilization) or practice abstinence if they want to avoid the financial and personal responsibilities of fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fomo/ECE3050063/stor-guide-saadan-undgaar-du-at-blive-far/|title=Stor guide: Sådan undgår du at blive far|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Great guide: How to avoid becoming a father }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/klummer/amaliekestler/ECE3067223/skyl-juridisk-abort-ud-med-badevandet/|title=Skyl 'juridisk abort' ud med badevandet|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Rinse 'legal abortion' out with the bathwater }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argue that a father's paper abortion is different from a female abortion since a child is born. Thus the best interests of the child should weigh more than equal opportunity to deny parenthood.{{r|Gudme (2016)}}

== In Scandinavia ==

=== Denmark ===
The concept of a paper abortion was first introduced in Denmark in 2000 by the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomicist]] Henrik Platz. He says that it is necessary from an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] perspective, to ensure that women and men have equal rights under the law. According to a Gallup poll from 2014 and earlier polls, between 40% and 70% of Danes agree with legalizing paper abortion.&lt;ref name=nyheder2016-03-13/&gt;

Sociologist Karen Sjørup, who conducted research on the topic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjørup|first1=Karen|title=Men´s right to paper abortion – a feminist perspective|url=http://interactingminds.au.dk/events/single-events/artikel/gendering-in-research-talk-by-karen-sjoerup-ruc/|website=Interacting Minds Centre|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it would give women more freedom by allowing those who want to become mothers without having to share the rights and duties of parenthood with men an additional way to do so. She also suggests that it could decrease the abortion rate because it would prevent men who wished to avoid fatherhood from pressuring women to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.information.dk/moti/2016/02/juridisk-abort-god-ting-ogsaa-kvinderne|title=Juridisk abort er en god ting – også for kvinderne|website=Information|language=Danish|access-date=2016-03-14|trans-title=Juridical abortion is a good thing - even for women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that just as women are able to choose whether to have a child or not, men should also be able to choose whether to assume paternity or not. Allowing men to have the opportunity to renounce the economic, social and legal responsibility for an unborn child during the first three months of pregnancy would give men and women as close to equal opportunities as possible.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annesophia.blogs.berlingske.dk/2016/01/30/skal-maend-have-fri-abort/|title= Skal mænd have fri abort?|website=ASH|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Should men be free to abort? | author = Anne Sophia Hermansen | date = 2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 2016, a regional branch of the Swedish Liberal Youth Party decided to support paper abortion for men until the 18th week of pregnancy, the time limit on abortions for women. The proposition was supported by some commentators, but not by the LYP's parent party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In fiction, a '''plot hole''', '''plothole''' or '''plot error''' is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/plot_hole|title=plot hole {{!}} Definition of plot hole in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events,&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/movies-plot-holes-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt; and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline. The term is more loosely also applied to "loose ends" in a plot – side-lined story elements that remain unresolved by the end of the plot.

In [[logic]], the semantic '''principle (or law) of bivalence''' states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one [[truth value]], either [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]].&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logic satisfying this principle is called a '''two-valued logic'''&lt;ref name="Goble2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bivalent logic'''.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürlimann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hürlimann|title=Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BThojvh-XUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=Gabler Verlag|isbn=978-3-8349-1493-4|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] may or may not possess. It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=vii|series=The handbook of the history of logic|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the law of the excluded middle ==

The principle of bivalence is related to  the [[law of excluded middle]] though the latter is a [[syntactic]] expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ &amp;not;P". The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.&lt;ref name="Priest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.

== Classical logic ==
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

Assigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];&lt;ref name="SørensenUrzyczyn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.

== Suszko's thesis ==
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Future contingents===
{{main|Problem of future contingents}}
A famous example&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:

: Imagine P refers to the statement "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."

The principle of bivalence here asserts:

: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.

Aristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===Vagueness===
Such puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

: This apple is red.&lt;ref&gt;Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: "This" as opposed to a more-vague "The". If "The" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell &amp; Whitehead observe that this " this " indicates "something given in sensation" and as such it shall be considered "elementary".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:

: This apple is red and it is not-red.

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (§64, pp.&amp;nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:

{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.

Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The third "truth value"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".}}

The following are his "strong tables":&lt;ref&gt;"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q &amp; R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R  " This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".

[[File:Randolph-diagram-disjunction.svg|thumb|250px|'''Randolph diagram''' that represents the logical statement &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical disjunction|disjunction]]).]]

A '''Randolph diagram''' ('''R-diagram''') is a simple way to visualize logical expressions and combinations of sets. Randolph diagrams were created by mathematician John F. Randolph in 1965, while he was teaching at the [[University of Arkansas]].

== Overview ==
Randolph diagrams can be interpreted most easily by defining each line as ''belonging to'' or ''relating to'' one logical statement or set. Any dot above the line indicates truth or inclusion and below the line indicates falsity or exclusion. Using this system, one can represent any combination of sets or logical statements using intersecting lines.

Though [[Venn diagram]]s are more commonly used to represent combinations of sets, Randolph diagrams have the advantage of being able to cleanly represent combinations of more than 3 sets. Venn diagrams require either extension into higher spatial dimensions or the use of more complicated shapes while Randolph diagrams evenly subdivide for every additional set.&lt;ref name="Sets and Randolph Diagrams"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Barksdale, Jr. |author-first=James B. |title=Sets and Randolph Diagrams |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED045458.pdf |work=Paper presented at the Louisville Regional Convention of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics |location=Louisville, Kentucky |date=October 1970 |publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]] |access-date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a comparison between a Venn diagram and R-diagram for 5 sets or logical statements:

[[File:Randolph-diagram-n5.svg|260px|A Randolph diagram for five sets]]

== History ==
In his introductory paper on the subject, ''Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations'',&lt;ref name="Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Randolph |author-first=John F. |title=Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations |jstor=2310972 |work=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=72 |number=2 |date=February 1965 |pages=117-127 |doi=10.1080/00029890.1965.11970498 |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph mentions that the first use of crosses and dots to represent logical relationships was introduced by [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|W. S. McCulloch]], a neurophysiologist and Randolph's contemporary. Randolph modified McCulloch's system with a new way of representing combinations and relationships of more than two logical statements or sets, namely subdividing each section of the R-diagram with a new diagonal line for each new element introduced. Randolph's paper suggests that his original notion was to use R-diagrams to represent logical relationships, and then expanded the idea to be applied to set theory as well. Throughout the paper, R-diagrams are used in conjunction with normal logical and set binary operation symbols.

== Application to logic theory ==
{{See also|Mathematical logic}}

When applying R-diagrams to logic theory, [[Truth value|logical statements]] p, q, and r can each become a line or multiple lines to visually display the validity of each element in a larger statement. Generally, p is thought to be represented by an upward sloping line (/) while q is represented by a downward sloping line (\). A dot in the diagram above a slanting line indicates truth for that statement; likewise, a dot below indicates falsity. The R-diagrams for p and q are shown below, respectively:

[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|100px]]
[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|100px]]

For more than two statements, the four spaces formed by the intersection of lines p and q must be subdivided into more lines. In the case of r, a single upward sloping line (/) is added in each of the four spaces. The R-diagram for r is shown below:

[[File:R-diagram-r.svg|150px]]

This method can be extended for any number of truth values:

[[File:Randolph-diagram-subdivisions.svg|600px|Randolph-diagram-subdivisions]], etc.

R-diagrams are primarily used to represent logical expressions. Given a logical proposition, R-diagrams are able to display the outcome of every possible true/false variation of each element, creating an alternative way to represent a [[truth table]].

=== Simplifying logical expressions ===
R-diagrams can be used to easily simplify complicated logical expressions, using a step-by-step process. Using order of operations, logical operators are applied to R-diagrams in the proper sequence. Finally, the result is an R-diagram that can be converted back into a simpler logical expression.

For example, take the following expression:

: &lt;math&gt;(Q \leftrightarrow P) \lor (\lnot P \land Q) \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can be simplified using R-diagrams as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \lor (&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-negation.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Randolph-diagram-bicondition.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-qminusp.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-implication.svg|40px]]

which is equal to:

: &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q. \, &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proving logical arguments ===
Similarly, R-diagrams can be used to prove or disprove logical arguments. Take, for instance, the well known argument [[modus ponens]], also known as implication elimination:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q, P}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be converted into a [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] logical expression,

: &lt;math&gt;((P \to Q) \land P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;

which can then be simplified using R-diagrams:

: &lt;math&gt;((&lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \land &lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

&lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-implication.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-conjunction.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-tautology.svg|40px]]

The result is an R-diagram in which every space has a dot. This means the argument is a tautology; it is true in all cases. An R-diagram in which no space has a dot is a [[contradiction]], a statement that is never true.

== Application to set theory ==
{{See also|Set theory}}

R-diagrams are also used in [[set theory]], as an alternative to Venn diagrams. In set theory, each line represents a set instead of a logical statement; A replaces p and B replaces q. When used for sets, a dot above the line represents inclusion, where a dot below represents exclusion. As in logic, basic set operations can be represented visually using R-diagrams:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+style="white-space:nowrap"| Basic Set Operations
|-
! Name !! Notation!! R-Diagram
|-
| [[Union (set theory)|Union]] || &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Randolph-diagram-disjunction.svg|75px]]
|-
| [[Intersection (set theory)|Intersection]] || &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Randolph-diagram-conjunction.svg|75px]]
|-
|-
| [[Complement (set theory)#Absolute complement|Absolute Complement]] || &lt;math&gt;A^{c}&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Randolph-diagram-negation.svg|75px]]
|-
| [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|Relative Complement (set difference)]] || &lt;math&gt;A \smallsetminus B&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Randolph-diagram-diff.svg|75px]]
|-
| [[Symmetric difference|Symmetric Difference]] || &lt;math&gt;A \Delta B&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Randolph-diagram-symdiff.svg|75px]]
|}

R-diagrams illustrate the equivalence between the set theoretical and logical concepts: intersection in set theory is equivalent to conjunction in logic, and set theory's union is equivalent to the logical disjunction.

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

[[File:Ring laser gyroscope at MAKS-2011 airshow.jpg|thumb|Ring laser gyroscope]]

A '''ring laser gyroscope''' ('''RLG''') consists of a [[ring laser]] having two independent counter-propagating resonant modes over the same path; the difference in the frequencies is used to detect rotation. It operates on the principle of the [[Sagnac effect]] which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation. [[Interference (wave propagation)|Interference]] between the counter-propagating beams, observed externally, results in motion of the standing wave pattern, and thus indicates rotation.

==Description==
The first experimental ring laser gyroscope was demonstrated in the US by Macek and Davis in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Warren M. Macek and D. T. M. Davis, Jr. (1963) "Rotation rate sensing with traveling-wave ring lasers," ''Applied Physics Letters'', vol. 2, pages 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various organizations worldwide subsequently developed ring-laser technology further. Many tens of thousands of RLGs are operating in [[inertial navigation system]]s and have established high accuracy, with better than 0.01°/hour bias uncertainty, and [[mean time between failures]] in excess of 60,000 hours.

[[Image:ring laser interferometer.png|frame|right|Schematic representation of a ring laser setup. At the beam sampling location, a fraction of each of the counterpropagating beams exits the laser cavity.]]

Ring laser gyroscopes can be used as the stable elements (for one degree of freedom each) in an [[inertial reference system]]. The advantage of using an RLG is that there are no moving parts (apart from the dither motor assembly, see further description below and laser-lock), compared to the conventional spinning [[gyroscope]]. This means there is no friction, which in turn means there will be no inherent drift terms. Additionally, the entire unit is compact, lightweight and highly durable, making it suitable for use in aircraft and also satellites. Unlike a mechanical gyroscope, the device does not resist changes to its orientation.

Contemporary applications of the Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG) include an embedded GPS capability to further enhance accuracy of RLG Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)s on military aircraft, commercial airliners, ships and spacecraft. These hybrid INS/GPS units have replaced their mechanical counterparts in most applications. Where ultra accuracy is needed however, spin gyro based INSs are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Taylor – INS Test Engineer Honeywell, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
A certain rate of rotation induces a small difference between the time it takes light to traverse the ring in the two directions according to the [[Sagnac effect]]. This introduces a tiny separation between the frequencies of the counter-propagating beams, a motion of the [[standing wave]] pattern within the ring, and thus a beat pattern when those two beams are interfered outside the ring. Therefore, the net shift of that interference pattern follows the rotation of the unit in the plane of the ring.

RLGs, while more accurate than mechanical gyroscopes, suffer from an effect known as "lock-in" at very slow rotation rates. When the ring laser is hardly rotating, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical. In this case, crosstalk between the counter-propagating beams can allow for [[injection locking]] so that the standing wave "gets stuck" in a preferred phase, thus locking the frequency of each beam to each other rather than responding to gradual rotation.

Forced [[dithering]] can largely overcome this problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a mechanical spring driven at its resonance frequency. This ensures that the angular velocity of the system is usually far from the lock-in threshold.  Typical rates are 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a peak dither velocity of 1 arc-second per second{{dubious|date=July 2013}}. &lt;!--What is a typical lock-in rate? Much higher than that would possibly solve!!--&gt; Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in can briefly occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400&amp;nbsp;Hz vibration.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie"&gt;''Knowing Machines'', Donald MacKenzie, The MIT Press, (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fibre optic gyroscope==
A related device is the [[fibre optic gyroscope]] which also operates on the basis of the Sagnac effect, but in which the ring is not a part of the laser. Rather, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an [[optical fiber]] ring, where rotation causes a relative phase shift between those beams when interfered after their pass through the fiber ring. The phase shift is proportional to the rate of rotation. This is less sensitive in a single traverse of the ring than the RLG in which the externally observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation itself, not its derivative. However the sensitivity of the fiber optic gyro is enhanced several times over the RLG by having a long optical fiber, coiled  for compactness, in which the Sagnac effect is multiplied according to the number of turns.

[[File:stopwatch2.jpg|right|thumb|Before the introduction of shot timers, the [[referee]] had to manually stop a stopwatch when the shooter was finished.]]
[[File:Stangskyting2.jpg|thumb|Some shot timers can be linked to big board displays to provide instant feedback to the audience.]]
'''A shot timer''' is a [[gunshot|shot]] activated timer used in [[shooting sport]]s, which starts the competitor by an audible signal and also records the competitor's time electronically by detecting the sound of each shot together with the time from the start signal. When the competitor is finished the timer will show the time from the start signal until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second ([[centisecond]]), which is required by competitions in the [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/RulesHandgun.pdf IPSC 2016 Handgun Rules, section 9.2.1.1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some timers come with additional functions:
* Par times: The timer first gives a start, then a stop signal after a pre-programmed time.
* Instant or delayed start signal: The start signal can either come instantly by the push of the start button, or by a delay between 1 to 4 seconds.
* Big board display: The possibility for direct connection to a big board display for instant audience feedback.
* The possibility for scoring points on target in addition to the time, with automatic hit factor calculation, making for a complete scoring solution. The results can be loaded to a computer, i.e. by Bluetooth or RF.
* Splits between shots fired
* Memory storage of previous runs
* Auxiliary jack for external loud horn, visual starts or target turning
* Adjustable shot detector sensitivity

Shot timers can also be downloaded as apps for smartphones, although less reliable than dedicated standalone units.

'''Single-minute exchange of die''' ('''SMED''') is one of the many [[lean production]] methods for reducing waste in a manufacturing process. It provides a rapid and efficient way of converting a manufacturing process from running the current product to running the next product. This rapid changeover is key to reducing production lot sizes and thereby improving flow ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]), reducing production loss and output variability.

The phrase "single minute" does not mean that all changeovers and startups should take only ''one'' minute, but that they should take less than 10 minutes (in other words, "single-digit minute").&lt;ref&gt;Study of Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, 1981, p 70&lt;/ref&gt; Closely associated is a yet more difficult concept, '''One-Touch Exchange of Die''', '''(OTED)''', which says changeovers can and should take less than 100 seconds.  A [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] is a tool used in manufacturing. However SMED's utility is not limited to manufacturing (see [[value stream mapping]]).

==History==
Frederick Taylor analyzed non-value-adding parts of setups in his 1911 book, ''Shop Management'' (page 171). However, he did not create any method or structured approach around it.

Frank Gilbreth studied and improved working processes in many different industries, from bricklaying to surgery. As part of his work, he also looked into changeovers. His book ''Motion Study'' (also from 1911) described approaches to reduce setup time.

Even Henry Ford's factories were using some setup reduction techniques. In the 1915 publication ''Ford Methods and Ford Shops'', setup reduction approaches were clearly described. However, these approaches never became mainstream. For most parts during the 20th century, the economic order quantity was the gold standard for lot sizing.

The JIT workflow of Toyota had this problem of tools changeover took between two and eight hours, Toyota could neither afford the lost production time nor the enormous lot sizes suggested by the economic order quantity. Lot reduction and set up time reduction had actually been ongoing in TPS since 1945 when Taiichi Ohno became manager of the machine shops in Toyota. On a trip to the US in 1955, Taiichi Ohno observed Danly stamping presses with rapid die change capability. Subsequently, Toyota bought multiple Danly presses for the Motomachi plant. And Toyota started to work on improving the changeover time of their presses. This was known as ''Quick Die Change'', or  ''QDC'' for short. They developed a structured approach based on a framework from the US World War II ''Training within Industry'' (TWI) program, called ECRS – Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify.

Over time they reduced these changeover times from hours to fifteen minutes by the 1960s, three minutes by the 1970s and then just 180 seconds by 1990s.

During the late 1970s, when Toyota's method was already well refined, Shigeo Shingo participated in one QDC workshop. After he started to publicize details of the Toyota Production System without permission, the business connection was terminated abruptly by Toyota. Shingo moved to the US and started to consult on lean manufacturing. Besides claiming to have invented this quick changeover method (among many other things), he renamed it ''Single Minute Exchange of Die'' or, in short, SMED. The ''Single Minute'' stands for a single digit minute (i.e., less than ten minutes). He promoted TPS and SMED in US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allaboutlean.com/smed-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twisummit.cn/downloads/2007/Smalley_Origins_and_Facts_Regarding_TPS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Toyota found that the most difficult tools to change were the dies on the large transfer-stamping machines that produce car vehicle body parts.  The dies – which must be changed for each model – weigh many tons, and must be assembled in the stamping machines with tolerances of less than a millimeter, otherwise the stamped metal will wrinkle, if not melt, under the intense heat and pressure.

When Toyota engineers examined the change-over, they discovered that the established procedure was to stop the line, let down the dies by an overhead crane, position the dies in the machine by human eyesight, and then adjust their position with crowbars while making individual test stampings.  The existing process took from twelve hours to almost three days to complete.

Toyota's first improvement was to place precision measurement devices on the transfer stamping machines, and record the necessary measurements for each model's die.  Installing the die against these measurements, rather than by human eyesight, immediately cut the change-over to a mere hour and a half.

Further observations led to further improvements – scheduling the die changes in a standard sequence (as part of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule|FRS]]) as a new model moved through the factory, dedicating tools to the die-change process so that all needed tools were nearby, and scheduling use of the overhead cranes so that the new die would be waiting as the old die was removed.  Using these processes, Toyota engineers cut the change-over time to less than 10 minutes per die, and thereby reduced the economic lot size below one vehicle.

The success of this program contributed directly to [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time manufacturing]] which is part of the [[Toyota Production System]]. SMED makes [[Production levelling|Load balancing]] much more achievable by reducing economic lot size and thus stock levels.

===Effects of implementation===

Shigeo Shingo, who created the SMED approach, claims&lt;ref&gt;A revolution in manufacturing: The SMED system, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1985, p 113&lt;/ref&gt; that in his data from between 1975 and 1985 that average setup times he has dealt with have reduced to 2.5% of the time originally required; a 40 times improvement.

However, the power of SMED is that it has a lot of other effects which come from systematically looking at operations; these include:

* Stockless production which drives inventory turnover rates,
* Reduction in footprint of processes with reduced inventory freeing floor space
* Productivity increases or reduced production time
** Increased machine work rates from reduced setup times even if number of changeovers increases
** Elimination of setup errors and elimination of trial runs reduces defect rates
** Improved quality from fully regulated operating conditions in advance
** Increased safety from simpler setups
** Simplified housekeeping from fewer tools and better organization
** Lower expense of setups
** Operator preferred since easier to achieve
** Lower skill requirements since changes are now designed into the process rather than a matter of skilled judgement
* Elimination of unusable stock from model changeovers and demand estimate errors
* Goods are not lost through deterioration
* Ability to mix production gives flexibility and further inventory reductions as well as opening the door to revolutionized production methods (large orders ≠ large production lot sizes)
* New attitudes on controllability of work process amongst staff

== Implementation ==

Shigeo Shingo recognizes  eight techniques&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p 47&lt;/ref&gt; that should be considered in implementing SMED.

# Separate internal from external setup operations
# Convert internal to external setup
# Standardize function, not shape
# Use functional clamps or eliminate fasteners altogether
# Use intermediate jigs
# Adopt parallel operations (see image below)
# Eliminate adjustments
# Mechanization
NB External setup can be done without the line being stopped whereas internal setup requires that the line be stopped.

He suggests&lt;ref&gt;A revolution in manufacturing: The SMED system, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1985, p 27&lt;/ref&gt; that SMED improvement should pass through four conceptual stages:

A) ensure that external setup actions are performed while the machine is still running,
B) separate external and internal setup actions, ensure that the parts all function and implement efficient ways of transporting the die and other parts,
C) convert internal setup actions to external,
D) improve all setup actions.

[[Image:smedfases.gif|center]]

===Formal method===
There are seven basic steps [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323033009/http://www.sevenrings.co.uk/SMED/HowtodoSMED.asp] to reducing changeover using the SMED system:

# OBSERVE the current methodology (A)
# Separate the INTERNAL and EXTERNAL activities (B). Internal activities are those that can only be performed when the process is stopped, while External activities can be done while the last batch is being produced, or once the next batch has started. For example, go and get the required tools for the job BEFORE the machine stops.
# Convert (where possible) Internal activities into External ones (C) (pre-heating of tools is a good example of this).
# Streamline the remaining internal activities, by simplifying them (D). Focus on fixings – [[Shigeo Shingo]] observed that it's only the last turn of a bolt that tightens it – the rest is just movement.
# Streamline the External activities, so that they are of a similar scale to the Internal ones (D).
# Document the new procedure, and actions that are yet to be completed.
# Do it all again: For each iteration of the above process, a 45% improvement in set-up times should be expected, so it may take several iterations to cross the ten-minute line.

This diagram shows four successive runs with learning from each run and improvements applied before the next.
* Run 1 illustrates the original situation.
* Run 2 shows what would happen if more changeovers were included.
* Run 3 shows the impact of the improvements in changeover times that come from doing more of them and building learning into their execution.
* Run 4 shows how these improvements can get you back to the same production time but now with more flexibility in production capacity.
* Run N (not illustrated) would have changeovers that take 1.5 minutes (97% reduction) and whole shift time reduced from 420 minutes to 368 minutes a productivity improvement of 12%.

The SMED concept is credited to [[Shigeo Shingo]], one of the main contributors to the consolidation of the [[Toyota Production System]], along with [[Taiichi Ohno]].

Look for:
# shortages, mistakes, inadequate verification of equipment causing delays and can be avoided by check tables, especially visual ones, and setup on an intermediary jig
# inadequate or incomplete repairs to equipment causing rework and delays
# optimization for least work as opposed to least delay
# unheated molds which require several wasted 'tests' before they will be at the temperature to work
# using slow precise adjustment equipment for the large coarse part of adjustment
# lack of visual lines or benchmarks for part placement on the equipment
# forcing a changeover between different raw materials when a continuous feed, or near equivalent, is possible
# lack of functional standardization, that is standardization of only the parts necessary for setup e.g. all bolts use same size spanner, die grip points are in the same place on all dies
# much operator movement around the equipment during setup
# more attachment points than actually required for the forces to be constrained
# attachment points that take more than one turn to fasten
# any adjustments after initial setup
# any use of experts during setup
# any adjustments of assisting tools such as guides or switches

'''Record all necessary data'''

[[Image:smedtemplate.gif|thumb|400 px|none|Data capture template]]

'''Parallel operations using multiple operators''' By taking the 'actual' operations and making them into a network which contains the dependencies it is possible to optimise task attribution and further optimize setup time. Issues of effective communication between the operators must be managed to ensure safety is assured where potentially noisy or visually obstructive conditions occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28035">The '''standard solar model''' (SSM) is a mathematical treatment of the [[Sun]] as a [[spherical]] ball of gas (in varying states of [[ionisation]], with the hydrogen in the deep interior being a completely ionised [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]). This [[stellar model|model]], technically the [[spherically symmetric]] [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] model of a star, has [[stellar structure]] described by several differential equations derived from basic physical principles. The model is constrained by [[boundary conditions]], namely the luminosity, radius, age and composition of the Sun, which are well determined. The age of the Sun cannot be measured directly; one way to estimate it is from the age of the oldest meteorites, and models of the evolution of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Guenther 1995"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All heavier elements, called ''[[metallicity|metals]]'' in astronomy, account for less than 2&amp;nbsp;percent of the mass. The SSM is used to test the validity of stellar evolution theory. In fact, the only way to determine the two free parameters of the stellar evolution model, the helium abundance and the [[mixing length theory|mixing length]] parameter (used to model convection in the Sun), are to adjust the SSM to "fit" the observed Sun.

==A calibrated solar model==
A star is considered to be at zero age (protostellar) when it is assumed to have a homogeneous composition and to be just beginning to derive most of its luminosity from nuclear reactions (so neglecting the period of contraction from a cloud of gas and dust). To obtain the SSM, a one [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) stellar model at zero age is [[stellar evolution|evolved]] numerically to the age of the Sun. The abundance of elements in the zero age solar model is estimated from primordial meteorites.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt; Along with this abundance information, a reasonable guess at the zero-age luminosity (such as the present-day Sun's luminosity) is then converted by an iterative procedure into the correct value for the model, and the temperature, pressure and density throughout the model calculated by solving the equations of stellar structure numerically assuming the star to be in a [[steady state]]. The model is then evolved numerically up to the age of the Sun. Any discrepancy from the measured values of the Sun's luminosity, surface abundances, etc. can then be used to refine the model. For example, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have settled out of the photosphere by diffusion. As a result, the Solar photosphere now contains about 87% as much helium and heavy elements as the protostellar photosphere had; the protostellar Solar photosphere was 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt; A measure of heavy-element settling by diffusion is required for a more accurate model.

==Numerical modelling of the stellar structure equations==
{{Main|stellar structure}}
The differential equations of stellar structure, such as the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, are integrated numerically. The differential equations are approximated by [[difference equations]]. The star is imagined to be made up of spherically symmetric shells and the numerical integration carried out in finite steps making use of the [[equation of state|equations of state]], giving relationships for the pressure, the opacity and the energy generation rate in terms of the density, temperature and composition.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"&gt;Ostlie, Dale A. and Carrol, Bradley W., [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-Bradley-Carroll/dp/0805304029/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b ''An introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics''], Addison-Wesley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the Sun==
{{Main|stellar evolution}}{{See also|sun}}
Nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun change its composition, by converting [[hydrogen]] nuclei into [[helium]] nuclei by the [[proton-proton chain]] and (to a lesser extent in the Sun than in more massive stars) the [[CNO cycle]]. This increases the mean molecular weight in the core of the Sun, which should lead to a decrease in pressure. This does not happen as instead the core contracts. By the [[Virial theorem|virial theorem]] half of the gravitational [[potential energy]] released by this contraction goes towards raising the temperature of the core, and the other half is radiated away.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This increase in temperature also increases the pressure and restores the balance of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The luminosity of the Sun is increased by the temperature rise, increasing the rate of nuclear reactions. The outer layers expand to compensate for the increased temperature and pressure gradients, so the radius also increases.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;

No star is completely static, but stars stay on the main sequence (burning hydrogen in the core) for long periods. In the case of the Sun, it has been on the main sequence for roughly 4.6 billion years, and will become a red giant in roughly 6.5 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1086/173407 | bibcode=1993ApJ...418..457S}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a total main sequence lifetime of roughly 11 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) years. Thus the assumption of [[steady state]] is a very good approximation{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. For simplicity, the stellar structure equations are written without explicit time dependence, with the exception of the luminosity gradient equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho \left( \epsilon - \epsilon_\nu \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here L is the luminosity, ε is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass and ε&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminosity due to neutrino emission (see [[#Energy transport in the Sun|below]] for the other quantities). The slow evolution of the Sun on the main sequence is then determined by the change in the nuclear species (principally hydrogen being consumed and helium being produced). The rates of the various nuclear reactions are estimated from particle physics experiments at high energies, which are extrapolated back to the lower energies of stellar interiors (the Sun burns hydrogen rather slowly). Historically, errors in the nuclear reaction rates have been one of the biggest sources of error in stellar modelling. Computers are employed to calculate the varying abundances (usually by mass fraction) of the nuclear species. A particular species will have a rate of production and a rate of destruction, so both are needed to calculate its abundance over time, at varying conditions of temperature and density. Since there are many nuclear species, a computerised [[reaction network]] is needed to keep track of how all the abundances vary together.

According to the [[Vogt-Russell theorem]], the mass and the composition structure throughout a star uniquely determine its radius, luminosity, and internal structure, as well as its subsequent evolution (though this "theorem" was only intended to apply to the slow, stable phases of stellar evolution and certainly does not apply to the transitions between stages and rapid evolutionary stages).&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;
The information about the varying abundances of nuclear species over time, along with the equations of state, is sufficient for a numerical solution by taking sufficiently small time increments and using iteration to find the unique internal structure of the star at each stage.

==Purpose of the standard solar model==
The SSM serves two purposes:
* it provides estimates for the helium abundance and mixing length parameter by forcing the stellar model to have the correct luminosity and radius at the Sun's age,
* it provides a way to evaluate more complex models with additional physics, such as rotation, magnetic fields and diffusion or improvements to the treatment of convection, such as modelling turbulence, and convective overshooting.

Like the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] and the [[physical cosmology|standard cosmology]] model the SSM changes over time in response to relevant new [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] or [[experimental physics]] discoveries.

==Energy transport in the Sun==
As described in the [[Sun]] article, the Sun has a radiative core and a convective outer envelope. In the core, the luminosity due to nuclear reactions is transmitted to outer layers principally by radiation. However, in the outer layers the temperature gradient is so great that radiation cannot transport enough energy. As a result, thermal convection occurs as thermal columns carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone.

In a solar model, as described in [[stellar structure]], one considers the [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[temperature]] T(r), total [[pressure]] (matter plus radiation) P(r), [[luminosity]] l(r) and energy generation rate per unit mass ε(r) in a spherical shell of a thickness dr at a distance r from the center of the star.

Radiative transport of energy is described by the radiative temperature gradient equation:
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {3 \kappa \rho l \over 16 \pi r^2 \sigma T^3},&lt;/math&gt;
where κ is the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the matter, σ is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and the [[Boltzmann constant]] is set to one.

Convection is described using [[mixing length theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hansen | last2=Kawaler | last3=Trimble | first=Carl J. | first2=Steven D. | first3=Virginia | publisher=Springer | edition=2nd | date=2004 | title=Stellar Interiors | isbn=0-387-20089-4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding temperature gradient equation (for [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] convection) is:
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = \left(1 - {1 \over \gamma} \right) {T \over P } { \mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r},&lt;/math&gt;
where γ = c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], the ratio of [[specific heat]]s in the gas. (For a fully ionized [[ideal gas]], γ = 5/3.)

Near the base of the Sun's convection zone, the convection is adiabatic, but near the surface of the Sun, convection is not adiabatic.

==Simulations of near-surface convection==
A more realistic description of the uppermost part of the convection zone is possible through detailed three-dimensional and time-dependent [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] simulations, taking into account [[radiative transfer]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Equations of state==
The numerical solution of the differential equations of stellar structure requires [[equation of state|equations of state]] for the pressure, opacity and energy generation rate, as described in [[stellar structure]], which relate these variables to the density, temperature and composition.

==Helioseismology==
{{Main|Helioseismology}}

Helioseismology is the study of the wave oscillations in the Sun. Changes in the propagation of these waves through the Sun reveal inner structures and allow astrophysicists to develop extremely detailed profiles of the interior conditions of the Sun. In particular, the location of the convection zone in the outer layers of the Sun can be measured, and information about the core of the Sun provides a method, using the SSM, to calculate the age of the Sun, independently of the method of inferring the age of the Sun from that of the oldest meteorites.&lt;ref name="bonannoetal2002"&gt;{{cite journal

==Neutrino production==

Hydrogen is fused into helium through several different interactions in the Sun.  The vast majority of [[neutrino]]s are produced through the [[pp chain]], a process in which four protons are combined to produce two [[proton]]s, two [[neutron]]s, two [[positron]]s, and two electron neutrinos.  Neutrinos are also produced by the [[CNO cycle]], but that process is considerably less important in the Sun than in other stars.

Most of the neutrinos produced in the Sun come from the first step of the pp chain but their energy is so low (&lt;0.425 [[MeV]])&lt;ref name="Bahcall"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are very difficult to detect.  A rare side branch of the pp chain produces the "[[boron]]-8" neutrinos with a maximum energy of roughly 15 MeV, and these are the easiest neutrinos to detect.  A very rare interaction in the pp chain produces the [[Proton–proton chain reaction#The pp IV .28Hep.29 branch|"hep" neutrinos]], the highest energy neutrinos predicted to be produced by the Sun.  They are predicted to have a maximum energy of about 18 MeV.

All of the interactions described above produce neutrinos with a [[spectrum]] of energies.  The [[electron capture]] of &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be produces neutrinos at either roughly 0.862 MeV (~90%) or 0.384 MeV (~10%).&lt;ref name="Bahcall"/&gt;

==Neutrino detection==
The weakness of the neutrino's interactions with other particles means that most neutrinos produced in the core of the Sun can [[Transparency (optics)|pass all the way through the Sun without being absorbed]]. It is possible, therefore, to observe the core of the Sun directly by detecting these neutrinos.

===History===
{{Main|solar neutrino problem}}

The first experiment to successfully detect cosmic neutrinos was [[Raymond Davis Jr.|Ray Davis's]] [[Homestake Experiment|chlorine experiment]], in which neutrinos were detected by observing the [[Nuclear transmutation|conversion]] of [[chlorine]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to radioactive [[argon]] in a large [[Chemical tank|tank]] of [[perchloroethylene]]. This was a reaction channel expected for neutrinos, but since only the number of argon decays was counted, it did not give any directional information, such as where the neutrinos came from. The experiment found about 1/3 as many neutrinos as were predicted by the standard solar model of the time, and this problem became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]].

While it is now known that the chlorine experiment detected neutrinos, some physicists at the time were suspicious of the experiment, mainly because they did not trust such radiochemical techniques. Unambiguous detection of solar neutrinos was provided by the [[Kamiokande-II]] experiment, a [[water]] [[Cerenkov]] detector with a low enough energy threshold to detect neutrinos through neutrino-electron [[elastic scattering]]. In the elastic scattering interaction the electrons coming out of the point of reaction strongly point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling, away from the Sun. This ability to "point back" at the Sun was the first conclusive evidence that the Sun is powered by nuclear interactions in the core. While the neutrinos observed in Kamiokande-II were clearly from the Sun, the rate of neutrino interactions was again suppressed compared to theory at the time. Even worse, the Kamiokande-II experiment measured about 1/2 the predicted flux, rather than the chlorine experiment's 1/3.

The solution to the solar neutrino problem was finally experimentally determined by the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO). The radiochemical experiments were only sensitive to electron neutrinos, and the signal in the water Cerenkov experiments was dominated by the electron neutrino signal. The SNO experiment, by contrast, had sensitivity to all three neutrino flavours. By simultaneously measuring the electron neutrino and total neutrino fluxes the experiment demonstrated that the suppression was due to the [[MSW effect]], the conversion of electron neutrinos from their pure flavour state into the second neutrino mass eigenstate as they passed through a [[resonance]] due to the changing density of the Sun. The resonance is energy dependent, and "turns on" near 2MeV.&lt;ref name="Bahcall"/&gt; The water Cerenkov detectors only detect neutrinos above about 5MeV, while the radiochemical experiments were sensitive to lower energy (0.8MeV for [[chlorine]], 0.2MeV for [[gallium]]), and this turned out to be the source of the difference in the observed neutrino rates at the two types of experiments.

===Proton–proton chain===
All neutrinos from the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] (PP neutrinos) have been detected except hep neutrinos (next point). Three techniques have been adopted: The radiochemical technique, used by [[Homestake experiment|Homestake]], [[Gallex]], [[Gallium Neutrino Observatory|GNO]] and [[SAGE (Soviet–American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]] allowed  to measure the neutrino flux above a minimum energy. The detector SNO used scattering on deuterium that allowed to measure the energy of the events, thereby identifying the single components of the predicted SSM neutrino emission. Finally,  [[Kamiokande]], [[Super-Kamiokande]], SNO, [[Borexino]] and [[KamLAND]] used elastic scattering on electrons, which allows the measurement of the neutrino energy. Boron8 neutrinos have been seen by Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, KamLAND. Beryllium7, pep, and PP neutrinos have been seen only by Borexino to date.

===hep neutrinos===
The highest energy neutrinos have not yet been observed due to their small flux compared to the boron-8 neutrinos, so thus far only limits have been placed on the flux. No experiment yet has had enough [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] to observe the flux predicted by the SSM.

===CNO cycle===
Neutrinos from the [[CNO cycle]] of solar energy generation – i.e., the CNO-neutrinos –  are also expected to provide observable events below 1 MeV. They have not yet been observed due to experimental noise (background). Ultra-pure scintillator detectors have the potential to probe the flux predicted by the SSM. This detection could be possible already in [[Borexino]]; the next scientific occasions will be in SNO+ and, on the longer term, in LENA and JUNO, three detectors that will be larger but will use the same principles of Borexino.

===Future experiments===
While radiochemical experiments have in some sense observed the pp and Be7 neutrinos they have measured only integral fluxes. The "[[holy grail]]" of solar neutrino experiments would detect the Be7 neutrinos with a detector that is sensitive to the individual neutrino energies.  This experiment would test the MSW hypothesis by searching for the turn-on of the MSW effect. Some [[Exotic matter|exotic]] models are still capable of explaining the solar neutrino deficit, so the observation of the MSW turn on would, in effect, finally solve the solar neutrino problem.

==Core temperature prediction==
The flux of boron-8 neutrinos is highly sensitive to the temperature of the core of the Sun, &lt;math&gt;\phi(^8B) \propto T^{25}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bahcall Tsun"&gt;

==Lithium depletion at the solar surface==
[[Stellar structure|Stellar model]]s of the Sun's evolution predict the solar surface chemical abundance pretty well except for [[lithium]] (Li).
The surface abundance of Li on the Sun is 140 times less than the [[protostar|protosolar]] value (i.e. the primordial abundance at the Sun's birth),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Astrophys. Library, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the solar lithium problem. A large range of Li abundances is observed in solar-type stars of the same age, mass, and metallicity as the Sun. Observations of an unbiased sample of stars of this type with or without observed planets ([[exoplanets]]) showed that the known planet-bearing stars have less than one per cent of the primordial Li abundance, and of the remainder half had ten times as much Li. It is hypothesised that the presence of planets may increase the amount of mixing and deepen the convective zone to such an extent that the Li can be burned. A possible mechanism for this is the idea that the planets affect the angular momentum evolution of the star, thus changing the rotation of the star relative to similar stars without planets; in the case of the Sun slowing its rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:TheLadyOrTheTiger.jpg|thumb|"The Lady, or the Tiger?" was the title story in an 1884 collection of twelve stories by [[Frank R. Stockton]] published by [[Scribner (publisher)|Scribner]]]]

"'''The Lady, or the Tiger?'''" is a much-anthologized [[short story]] written by [[Frank R. Stockton]] for publication in the magazine ''[[The Century Magazine|The Century]]'' in 1882. "The Lady, or the Tiger?" has entered the [[English language]] as an [[allegory|allegorical]] expression, a shorthand indication or [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]], for a problem that is unsolvable.

==Plot summary==
The short story takes place in a land ruled by a semi-barbaric king. Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king's innovations is the use of a public [[trial by ordeal]] as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public [[arena]] and must choose one of two doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/lady-tiger-frank-stockton-american-stories/2524590.html VOA Learning English video]&lt;/ref&gt; Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it.

The king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.

The outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. "And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door – the lady, or the tiger?"

===By Stockton===
Stockton later wrote "The Discourager of Hesitancy,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1885jul-00482 "The Discourager of Hesitancy" in the ''Century Magazine'' Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; a follow-up to "The Lady, or the Tiger?" that begins with five travelers visiting the kingdom to discover what the accused man in that story found behind the door he chose. An official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king's will, through the subtle threat of the large "cimeter" ([[scimitar]]) he carried.

At noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice.

The kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of "The Lady, or the Tiger?" The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision.

===By other artists===
A play adaptation by [[Sydney Rosenfeld]] debuted at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1888 ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience – neither a lady or tiger, but an old hag.&lt;ref name="lady1"&gt;Smith, Cecil &amp; Glenn Litton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1VvYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Musical Comedy in America], p. 44 (1991 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toyah Willcox]] and [[Robert Fripp]] released a recording of "The Lady, or the Tiger?" and "The Discourager of Hesitancy" with Willcox reading the stories to electric guitar accompaniment by Fripp.

"The Lady, or the Tiger?" is one of three short stories that were adapted into the [[musical comedy]] ''[[The Apple Tree]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apple Tree|publisher=Music Theatre International|url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was the inspiration for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s puzzle book by the same title, ''The Lady, or the Tiger?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0812921178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of [[logic puzzle]]s in the book had a similar scenario to the short story in which a king gives each prisoner a choice between a number of doors; behind each one was either a lady or a tiger. However, the king bases the prisoner's fate on intelligence and not luck by posting a statement on each door that can be true or false.

Crooks|Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation]] on 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/lady-or-the-tiger-and-a-discussion-of-frank-stocktons-the-lady-or-the-tiger/oclc/422754519 |title= The lady or the tiger? ; and, A Discussion of Frank Stockton's The Lady, or the tiger? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= WorldCat |access-date= 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kids.britannica.com/kids/assembly/view/139771 |title= Frank Stockton's story |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= Britannica Kids |access-date= 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Lady, or the Tiger?" is referenced in "[[Ennui (sonnet)|Ennui]]", a [[sonnet]] written by [[Sylvia Plath]] and published 43 years after her death. Plath's sonnet, however, speaks of an age when the choice has become no longer relevant.

[[Alternative rock]] band [[They Might Be Giants]] released the song "The Lady and the Tiger" on their 2011 album ''[[Join Us]]''. Like the story, the song ends without a conclusion. The last line reads, "The hall remains, it still contains a pair of doors, a choice. Behind one door, a muffled roar, behind the other, a voice."

''The Lady or the Tiger'' is a one-act play adapted from Stockton's short story and published by [[Lazy Bee Scripts]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lazybeescripts.co.uk/Scripts/script.aspx?iSS=312|title=The Lady or the Tiger by Gerald P. Murphy|work=Lazy Bee Scripts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Purr-fect Crime", Season 1, Episode 19 of the U.S. television series [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] ends with a cliffhanger in which Batman is presented with two doors; one of which opens to Catwoman and the other opens to a tiger. Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Batman (TV Series): The Purr-fect Crime (1966): Plot Summary |publisher=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519547/plotsummary |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|Most modern English speakers encounter "thou" predominantly in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], in the works of other renaissance, medieval and early modern writers, and in the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;q=thee#v=snippet&amp;q=thee&amp;f=false "thou, thee, thine, thy (prons.)"], Kenneth G.

M. |url=http://www.bardweb.net/content/thou.html |title=Thou Pesky 'Thou' |website=Shakespeare Resource Centre |date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word '''''thou''''' ({{IPAc-en|ð|aʊ}}) is a [[grammatical person|second person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]] in [[English language|English]]. It is now largely [[archaism|archaic]], having been replaced in most contexts by ''[[you]]''. It is used in parts of Northern [[England]] and in [[Modern Scots|Scots]] ({{IPA|/ðu/}}), and also in rural parts of [[Newfoundland]] albeit as a recessive feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Sandra |date=2010 |title=Newfoundland and Labrador English |location=Scotland |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=89|isbn=9780748631414  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is '''''thee''''' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), the [[genitive|possessive]] is '''''thy''''' (adjective) or '''''thine''''' (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] is '''''thyself'''''. When ''thou'' is the [[grammatical subject]] of a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]], the verb form typically ends in ''-(e)st'' (e.g., "thou goest"; "thou do(e)st"), but in some cases just ''-t'' (e.g., "thou art"; "thou shalt"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in -s, hence the [[Quaker]] habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with "thee" as the subject (paralleling the usage of "you").

Originally, ''thou'' was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'', derived from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|ancient Indo-European]] root. In [[Middle English]], ''thou'' was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small "u" over the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]]: þͧ. Starting in the 1300s, ''thou'' was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, ''you'', the oblique/objective form of ''ye'', was used for formal circumstances (see [[T–V distinction]])&lt;ref name="MED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=yǒu (pron.) |encyclopedia= Middle English Dictionary |date= |year=2014 |publisher=the Regents of the University of Michigan |location= |id= |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED54032|access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 17th century, ''thou'' fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.

Early English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to [[God]] in [[French language|French]] (in [[Protestantism in France|Protestantism]] both in past and present, in [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholicism]] since the post-[[Vatican II]] reforms), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Ukrainian language| Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]] (all of which maintain the use of an "informal" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] between singular and plural second person pronouns and verb forms, so they used ''thou'', ''thee'', ''thy'', and ''thine'' for singular, and ''ye'', ''you'', ''your'', and ''yours'' for plural.

In standard [[modern English]], ''thou'' continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language and in certain fixed phrases such as "[[wikt:fare thee well|fare thee well]]". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of ''thou'' and ''ye'' through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as ''[[yinz]]'', ''yous''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM.|last = Kortmann|first = Bernd|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 2004|isbn = 978-3110175325|location = |page = 1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[y'all]]'' or the colloquial ''you guys''. ''Ye'' remains common in some parts of Ireland but these examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.

==Grammar==
Because ''thou'' has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Declension===
The English [[personal pronoun]]s have standardized [[declension]] according to the following table:{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
{{Early Modern English personal pronouns (table)}}

===Conjugation===
Verb forms used after ''thou'' generally end in ''-est'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|-|ɪ|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|-|ə|s|t}}) or ''-st'' in the [[indicative mood]] in both the [[present tense|present]] and the [[past tense|past]] [[grammatical tense|tenses]].  These forms are used for both [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s.

Typical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow.  The ''e'' in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized.  In verse, the choice about whether to use the ''e'' often depended upon considerations of [[meter (poetry)|meter]].

*to know: ''thou knowest'', thou knewest''
*to drive: ''thou drivest'', thou drovest''
*to make: ''thou makest'', thou madest''
*to love: ''thou lovest'', thou lovedst''

Modal verbs also have ''-(e)st'' added to their forms:
*can: ''thou canst''
*could: ''thou couldst''
*may: ''thou mayest''
*might: ''thou mightst''
*should: ''thou shouldst''
*would: ''thou wouldst''
*ought to: ''thou oughtest to''

A few verbs have irregular ''thou'' forms:
*to be: ''thou art'' (or ''thou beest''), ''thou wast'' {{IPAc-en|w|ɒ|s|t}} (or ''thou wert''; originally ''thou were'')
*to have: ''thou hast'', ''thou hadst''
*to do: ''thou dost'' {{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|s|t}} (or ''thou doest'' in non-[[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] use) and ''thou didst''
*shall: ''thou shalt''
*will: ''thou wilt''
*must: ''thou must'' (not inflected)

In Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was ''-es''. This came down unchanged from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: [[Russian language|Russian]] знаешь, ''znayesh'', thou knowest; [[Latin]] ''amas'', thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, ''znayet'', he knoweth, Latin ''amat'' he loveth.) The anomalous development from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related [[German language|German]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the [[consonant]] of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fennell |first=Barbara A.|title=A history of English: a sociolinguistic approach. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the equivalent of "thou", ''du'', also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of "you", ''gij'' (later ''jij'' or ''u''), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by ''jullie'' (''cf.'' English ''you people, you guys'').

In the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Grammatical mood#Imperative|imperative moods]], the ending in ''-(e)st'' is dropped (although it is generally retained in ''thou wert'', the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb "to be"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after "if" and the poetic "and".

In modern regional English dialects that use ''thou'' or some variant, such as in [[Yorkshire dialect#Vocabulary and grammar|Yorkshire]], it often takes the third person form of the verb ''-s''. This comes from a merging of [[Early Modern English]] second person singular ending ''-st'' and third person singular ending ''-s'' into ''-s'' (the latter a southern [[isogloss|variation]] of ''[[Thorn (letter)|-þ]]'' (''-th'')).

The present [[indicative]] form ''art'' ("''þu eart''") goes back to [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] Old English (see [[OED]] ''s.v. be'' IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (''e.g.'' in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from [[Danelaw|the North]], ''cf.'' [[History of the Icelandic language#The Scandinavian period (550–1050)|Icelandic]] ''þú ert''. For its ultimate origin, see OED ''be'', etymology section i.ε/ζ. The preterite indicative of ''be'' is generally ''thou wast''.

==Etymology==
''Thou'' originates from [[Old English language|Old English]] {{lang|ang|þū}}, and ultimately via [[Grimm's law]] from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''tu'', with the expected [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[vowel]] lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an [[open syllable]]. ''Thou'' is therefore [[cognate]] with [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|þú}}, [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavian languages|Continental Scandinavian]]&lt;!-- = Danish, Swedish, Norwegian--&gt; {{lang|da|du}}, [[Latin]] and all major [[Romance languages]]&lt;!-- = Aragonese, Aromanian, Asturian, Castilian, Catalan, French, Italian, Leonese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Portuguese, Romanian, Sicilian, Spanish BUT NOT Galician, Lombard, Piedmontese, Rhaeto-Romansh, Sardinian, Venetian http://www.nativlang.com/romance-languages/romance-tables.php?tableName=pronounsPersonal--&gt;, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|ro|tu}} or {{lang|es|tú}}, [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|σύ}} ({{transl|el|sy}}), [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ты / ''ty''  or ти / ''ti'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|դու}} ({{transl|hy|dow}}/{{transl|hy|du}}), [[Hindi]] तू ({{transl|hi|tū}}), [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: তুই (''tui''), [[Persian language|Persian]] {{rtl-lang|fa|تُو}} ({{transl|fa|to}}) and [[Sanskrit]] त्वम् ({{lang|sa-Latn|tvam}}). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.&lt;ref&gt;Entries for ''thou'' and *''tu'', in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
The second person pronouns in [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are also similar.

==History==
===Old and Middle English===
[[File:Adam and Eve, thou abbrev.jpg|thumb|right|''þ&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;'', abbreviation for ''thou'', from ''Adam and Eve'', from a ca. 1415 manuscript, England]]
In [[Old English]], ''thou'' was governed by a simple rule: ''thou'' addressed one person, and ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' more than one. Beginning in the 1300's ''thou'' was gradually replaced by the plural ''ye'' as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, ''thou'' remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.&lt;ref name="MED"/&gt;

The practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the [[T–V distinction]] and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing [[monarch|kings]] and other [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] in the [[plural]]. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, ''tu'' was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form ''vous'' was reserved and formal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===General decline in Early Modern English===
Fairly suddenly in the 17th century, ''thou'' began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] farther from London,&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of ''thou'' in the 17th century include the increasing identification of ''you'' with "polite society" and the uncertainty of using ''thou'' for inferiors versus ''you'' for superiors (with ''you'' being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Nordquist, Richard (2016). "[https://www.thoughtco.com/notes-on-second-person-pronouns-1692677 Notes on Second-Person Pronouns: Whatever Happened to 'Thou' and 'Thee'?]" ''ThoughtCo''. About, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''A Grammar of the English Tongue'', wrote: "in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular", implying that ''thou'' was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while ''you'' could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] (specifically, [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire), where the usage of ''thou'' persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of [[Southern English English|southern British English]], ''thou'' had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''thou'' in ''[[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.

One notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns ''thou'', ''thy'', and ''thee'' is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of [[Early Modern English]] texts, such as many character interactions in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use ''thou'' (rather than ''you'') when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Carl D. (ed.) (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8buSTBjFyUC&amp;q=%22thou...was...the+pronoun%22 Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary]''. Associated University Presses. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Use as a verb===
Many European languages contain verbs meaning "to address with the informal pronoun", such as German ''duzen'', the Norwegian noun ''dus'' refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French ''tutoyer'', Spanish ''tutear'', Swedish ''dua'', Dutch ''jijen en jouen'', Russian ''тыкать (tykat')'', Polish ''tykać'', Romanian ''tutui'', Hungarian ''tegezni'' etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1603, when Sir [[Edward Coke]], prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to [[insult]] Raleigh by saying,

:''I thou thee, thou traitor!''&lt;ref&gt;Reported, among many other places, in [[H. L. Mencken]], ''[[The American Language]]'' (1921), ch. 9, ss. 4., [http://www.bartleby.com/185/41.html "The pronoun"].&lt;/ref&gt;
::In modern English: ''I "thou" you, you traitor!''

here using ''thou'' as a verb meaning ''to call (someone) "thou" or "thee"''. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in [[Yorkshire dialect]] for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:

:''Don't thee tha them as thas thee!'' 
::In modern English: ''Don't "thee" (you) those who "thee" you!''
::In other words:  ''Don't use the familiar form "thee" towards those who refer to you as "thee".'' ("tha" being the local dialectal variant of "thou")

And similar in [[Lancashire dialect]]:

:''Don't thee me, thee; I's you to thee!''
::In standard English: ''Don't "thee" me, you! I'm "you" to you!''

===Religious uses===
As [[William Tyndale]] [[Tyndale Bible|translated the Bible]] into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] originals. He used ''thou'' for the singular and ''ye'' for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the [[addressee]]. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier [[Wycliffe's Bible]] and the later [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. But as the use of ''thou'' in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jespersen|first1=Otto|authorlink1=Otto Jespersen|title=Progress in Language|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026448203#page/n279/mode/2up|year=1894|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.&lt;ref&gt;David Daniell, ''William Tyndale: A Biography''. (Yale, 1995) {{ISBN|0-300-06880-8}}. See also David Daniell, ''The Bible in English: Its History and Influence''. (Yale, 2003) {{ISBN|0-300-09930-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1662 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which is still the authorized form of worship in the [[Church of England]], also uses the word ''thou'' to refer to the singular second person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/bcp/ ''The Book of Common Prayer'']. The Church of England. Retrieved on 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] formerly used ''thee'' as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying ''thee'' for both nominative and accusative cases.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.bartelby.net/248/456.html ''The Quaker Widow''] by [[Bayard Taylor]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by [[George Fox]], who called it "plain speaking", as an attempt to preserve the [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the [[north Midlands]] area. The preservation of ''thee'' in Quaker speech may relate to this history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David Hackett |last=Fischer|authorlink =David Hackett Fischer | title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]] |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-19-506905-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of "plain speaking" often use the "thee" form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, ''is thee'' or ''was thee''.&lt;ref name="Quaker Thee"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ezra Kempton |last=Maxfield |title=Quaker 'Thee' and Its History |journal=American Speech |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=1926 |pages=638–644 |doi=10.2307/452011 |jstor=452011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latter-day Saint]] prayer tradition, the terms "thee" and "thou" are always and exclusively used to address [[God]], as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Oaks |first= Dallin H. |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |title= The Language of Prayer |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1993/05/the-language-of-prayer?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are used. One particular example is [[The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation]], translated by [[Maulvi Sher Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|1 85372 314 2}}) by Islam International Publications Ltd. Islamabad, Sheephatch Lane, Tilford, Surrey GUl 0 2AQ, UK.[https://www.alislam.org/quran/Holy-Quran-English.pdf The Holy Quran, English Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English translations of the [[Bahá'í literature|scripture]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are also used.  [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original [[Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]] to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Diana | last = Malouf | chapter = The Vision of Shoghi Effendi | title = Proceedings of the Association for Baha'i Studies, Ninth Annual Conference | date = November 1984 | location = Ottawa, Canada | pages = 129–139 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun ''thou'' exclusively to address [[God]], using ''you'' in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the [[Psalms]] and similar text in devotional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html Preface to the ''Revised Standard Version''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518063139/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html |date=2016-05-18 }} 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Standard Bible]] (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 [[Revised English Bible]] dropped all forms of ''thou'' that had appeared in the earlier [[New English Bible]] (1970). The [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989) omits ''thou'' entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of ''thou'' in [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |title=NRSV: To the Reader |publisher=Ncccusa.org |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206062332/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to God, "thou" is often capitalized for clarity and reverence.

===Literary uses===

====Shakespeare====
Like his contemporaries [[William Shakespeare]] uses ''thou'' both in the intimate, French style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other ''ye'' or ''you'' as often as they call each other ''thou'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, in the following passage from ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV]]'', Shakespeare has [[Falstaff]] use both forms with Henry. Initially using "you" in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate "thou".

:'''PRINCE:''' Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? ...

:'''FALSTAFF:''' Indeed, you come near me now, Hal ... And, I [[prithee]], sweet wag, when thou art a king, as God save thy Grace{{spaced ndash}}Majesty, I should say; for grace thou wilt have none&amp;nbsp;–

While in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet's antagonism towards his mother.

:'''QUEEN GERTRUDE:''' Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended..

:'''HAMLET:''' Mother, you have my father much offended.

====More recent uses====
Except where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of ''thou'' has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn [[ritual]] occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813193259/http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 13, 2004 |title=Psalm 90 |access-date=May 23, 2017 |df= }} from the [[Revised Standard Version]]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[skylark]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html ''Ode to a Skylark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104055626/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html |date=2009-01-04 }} by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Achilles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/166/38.html ''The Iliad''], translated by [[E.

In Leonard Cohen's song "[[Bird on the Wire]]", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying "I will make it all up to thee." The [[Kaiser Chiefs]] song "I Predict a Riot" is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]" (written by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]]) we hear the lyric "Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'." These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of "Upside Down", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. 

Most modern writers have no experience using ''thou'' in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional [[Grammatical conjugation|verb forms]]. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending ''-eth'' with ''thou'', for example ''thou thinketh''. The converse{{spaced ndash}}the use of the second person singular ending ''-est'' for the third person—also occurs ("So sayest Thor!"{{spaced ndash}}spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern [[parody]] and [[pastiche]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Rob Liefeld]], "Awaken the Thunder" (Marvel Comics, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', vol. 2, issue 1, cover date Nov. 1996, part of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline.)&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are often transposed.

In the fictional teenage [[argot]] [[nadsat]], invented for [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]]), [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] and his ''droogs'' regularly use "thou", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of "you" and "thou" for the second person):

:''Well if it isn't fat stinking billygoat Billyboy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip-oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Burgess | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | title = A Clockwork Orange | publisher = William Heinemann | year = 1962 | page = 15 | isbn = 0-434-09800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some translators render the T–V distinction in English with "thou" and "you", particularly in places where ''you'' appears in the place of expected ''thou'', or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. [[Ernest Hemingway]], in his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', uses the forms "thou" and "you" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the [[Spanish language]] in which both formal (''usted'') and familiar (''tú'') second-person pronouns still exist.

In reading passages with ''thou'' and ''thee'', many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the ''e'' in ''-est'' ought to be unstressed, and ''thou'' and ''thee'' should be no more stressed than ''you''.

==Current usage==
''You'' is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, "thou" has persisted,&lt;ref name="northern_england"&gt;{{cite journal | title='You' and 'Thou' in Northern England | first=William | last=Evans | journal=South Atlantic Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=4 |date=November 1969 | pages=17–21 | doi=10.2307/3196963 | publisher=South Atlantic Modern Language Association | jstor=3196963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as [[y'all]] in the [[Southern United States]]. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Persistence of second-person singular===
In traditional dialects, ''thou'' is used in the counties of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and some western parts of [[Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trudgill|title=The Dialects of England|isbn=978-0631218159|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person, for example ''thee coost'' (standard English: ''you could'', archaic: ''thou couldst'') in northern Staffordshire. The word ''thee'' is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the [[Dawley]] area of [[Telford]] and referred to as the Dawley dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telford-live.com/2012/10/the-dawley-dictionary/ |title=The Dawley Dictionary|first=Pete|last=Jackson|publisher=Telford Live|date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The possessive is often written as ''thy'' in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed ''tha'', and the possessive form of ''tha'' has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming ''yours'' or the local{{Specify|date=September 2008}} word ''your'n'' (from ''your one''):{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and [[genitive]] forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing ''tha'' to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.

Some other variants are specific to certain areas. In [[Sheffield]], the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the "dee-dahs" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, ''ta'' was used as an unstressed shortening of ''thou'', which can be found in the song "[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]". These variants are no longer in use.

In rural North [[Lancashire]] between Lancaster and the [[North Yorkshire]] border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as "What would ''tha'' like for ''thi'' tea?" (What would you like for your dinner), and {{"'}}appen ''tha'' waint" ("perhaps you won't"{{spaced ndash}}'''happen''' being the [[dialect]] word for '''perhaps''') and "tha knows" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.

The use of the word "thee" in the hit song "[[I Predict a Riot]]" by [[Leeds]] band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] ("Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee") caused some comment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml |title=BBC ''Top of the Pops'' web page |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-03-18|archivedate=2010-06-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618075108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]].

The use of the phrase "tha knows" has been widely used in various songs by [[Arctic Monkeys]], a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with "tha knows" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.

The use persists somewhat in the [[West Country dialects]], albeit somewhat affected. Some of [[the Wurzels]] songs include "Drink Up Thy [[Cider|Zider]]" and "Sniff Up Thy Snuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |title=Cider drinkers target core audience in Bristol |work=Bristol Evening Post |date=April 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405190846/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |archive-date=2010-04-05 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |postscript=,}} and [http://www.wurzelmania.co.uk/ Wurzelmania.] somersetmade ltd.

In [[Shetlandic]], the other form of [[Insular Scots]], ''du'' and ''de'' are used. The word "thou" has been reported in the [[North Northern Scots]] dialect of [[Cromarty]] as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and now only in occasional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/download/files/The%20Cromarty%20Fisherfolk%20Dialect.pdf  The Cromarty Fisherfolk Dialect], Am Baile, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tip of the tongue''' (or '''TOT''') is the phenomenon of failing to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial [[recall (memory)|recall]] and the feeling that retrieval is imminent.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown| first1=AS.| title=A review of the tip-of-the-tongue experience.| journal=Psychological Bulletin| volume=109 | issue=2 | pages=204–23|date=Mar 1991| doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.2.204| pmid=2034750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon's name comes from the saying, "It's on the tip of my tongue."&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Schwartz| first1=BL.| title=Sparkling at the end of the tongue: the etiology of tip-of-the-tongue phenomenology.| journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review| volume=6| issue=3| pages=379–93|date=Sep 1999 | url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~schwartb/sparkling.pdf | pmid=12198776 | doi=10.3758/bf03210827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Roger| last2=McNeill| first2=David| title=The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior| volume=5|issue=4| year=1966|pages=325–337 |url=http://www.itma.vt.edu/itma2/modules/digaud/brown_old.pdf| doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(66)80040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rastle Burke 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rastle|first1=Kathleen G.|last2=Burke|first2=Deborah M.|title=Priming the Tip of the Tongue: Effects of Prior Processing on Word Retrieval in Young and Older Adults|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=35|issue=4|year=1996|pages=586–605|doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tip of the tongue phenomenon reveals that lexical access occurs in stages.&lt;ref name="Beattie 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Beattie| first1=G.| last2=Coughlan| first2=J.| title=An experimental investigation of the role of iconic gestures in lexical access using the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.| journal=Br J Psychol| volume=90| issue=1 | pages=35–56 |date=Feb 1999 |doi=10.1348/000712699161251| pmid=10085545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Schwartz| first1=BL.| last2=Metcalfe| first2=J. | title=Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) states: retrieval, behavior, and experience| journal = Memory &amp; Cognition| volume=39| issue=5| pages=737–49|date=Jul 2011| doi=10.3758/s13421-010-0066-8| pmid=21264637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People experiencing the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall one or more features of the target word, such as the first letter, its [[syllable|syllabic stress]], and words similar in sound and/or meaning.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt; Individuals report a feeling of being seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, and a sense of relief when the word is found.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; While many aspects of the tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence, the ''direct-access view'' and the ''inferential view''. The direct-access view posits that the state occurs when memory strength is not enough to recall an item, but is strong enough to trigger the state. The inferential view claims that TOTs aren't completely based on inaccessible, yet activated targets; rather they arise when the rememberer tries to piece together different clues about the word. Emotional-induced retrieval often causes more TOT experiences than an emotionally neutral retrieval, such as asking where a famous icon was assassinated rather than simply asking the capital city of a state.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Schwartz| first1=BL.| title=The effects of emotion on tip-of-the-tongue states.| journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review| volume=17| issue=1 | pages=82–7|date=Feb 2010| doi=10.3758/PBR.17.1.82| pmid=20081165|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~schwartb/totemotion.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional TOT experiences also have a longer retrieval time than non-emotional TOT experiences.  The cause of this  is unknown but possibilities include using a different retrieval strategy when having an emotional TOT experience rather than a non-emotional TOT experience, fluency at the time of retrieval, and strength of memory.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Schwartz| first1=BL.| title=The relation of tip-of-the-tongue states and retrieval time.| journal=Memory &amp; Cognition| volume=29| issue=1| pages=117–26|date=Jan 2001| doi=10.3758/BF03195746| pmid=11277455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TOT states should be separated from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, is the feeling that one will be able to recognize - from a list of items - an item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing articles of the separability of the process underlying these concepts. However, there is some evidence that TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Schwartz| first1=Bennett L.|title=Tip-of-the-tongue states as metacognition| journal=Metacognition and Learning| volume=1| issue=2 |date=Apr 2006| pages=149–158| url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~schwartb/metlearnTOT.pdf|doi=10.1007/s11409-006-9583-z| citeseerx=10.1.1.529.2568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An occasional tip-of-the-tongue state is normal for people of all ages. TOT becomes more frequent as people age.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"/&gt; TOT is only a medical condition when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life. This disorder is called [[anomic aphasia]] when acquired by brain damage, usually from a [[head injury]], [[stroke]], or [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2002&amp;context=etd | title = Examining the neurocognitive profile of dysnomia: a comparison of school-aged children with and without dyslexia across the domains of expressive language, attention/memory, and academic achievement | accessdate = 2011-05-23 | last = Howarth | first = Robyn Ann | publisher = University of Iowa | quote = Dysnomia is the inability to retrieve the correct word from memory when it is}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tip of the tongue phenomenon has implications for research in [[psycholinguistics]], [[memory]], and [[metacognition]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|[[William James]] was the first psychologist to describe the tip of the tongue phenomenon, although he did not label it as such]]

The term "tip of the tongue" is borrowed from colloquial usage,&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; and possibly a [[calque]] from the French phrase ''avoir le mot sur le bout de la langue'' ("having the word on the tip of the tongue"). The tip of the tongue phenomenon was first described as a psychological phenomenon in the text ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' by [[William James]] (1890), although he did not label it as such.&lt;ref name= "James"&gt;James, W. (1890). ''Principles of Psychology''. Retrieved from http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] also discussed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] psychological factors, such as unconscious [[thoughts]] and [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] that might cause forgetting familiar words.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;Freud, S. (1965). ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[empirical research]] on this phenomenon was undertaken by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] researchers [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[David McNeill]] and published in 1966 in the ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior''.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt; Brown and McNeill wanted to determine whether the feeling of imminent retrieval experienced in the tip of the tongue state was based on actual retrieval ability or was just an illusion.&lt;ref name="Baddeley"&gt;Baddeley, A, Eysenck, M., &amp; Anderson, M. (2009). ''Memory''. New York: Psychology Pres Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their study, Brown and McNeill read out definitions of rare words to the study participants and asked them to name the object being defined, and the target word was later read by the experimenter.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt; Participants were instructed to report whether they experienced a tip of the tongue state.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; Three types of positive TOT states were identified by Brown and McNeill: 
# the participant recognized the word read by the experimenter as the word he had been seeking,
# the participant correctly recalled the word before it was read by the experimenter, and
# subject recalled the word they were seeking before the target word was read by the experimenter, but the recalled word was not the intended target.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt; 
If a participant indicated a tip of the tongue state, they were asked to provide any information about the target word they could recall.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; Brown and McNeill found that participants could identify the first letter of the target word, the number of syllables of the target word, words of similar sound, words of similar meaning, syllabic pattern, and the serial position of some letters in the target word better than would be expected by chance.&lt;ref name="Brown McNeill 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; Their findings demonstrated the legitimacy of the feeling of knowing experienced in a tip of the tongue state. This study was the foundation for subsequent research about tip of the tongue phenomenon.

== Universality ==

Tip of the tongue experiences occur in people regardless of gender. The tip of the tongue phenomenon is known to occur in young adulthood, middle age, and older adulthood. Tip of the tongue experiences in childhood have not been studied. Education level is not thought to be a factor in the experience of tip of the tongue states. Monolinguals, bilinguals, and multilinguals all experience tip of the tongue states, although with varying frequencies (see [[#Effects of bilingualism|Effects of bilingualism]]).

Many languages other than English have equivalent colloquial terms for the tip of the tongue experience, suggesting that it is a common experience across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; In a study by B. L. Schwartz (1999), 45 of the 51 languages surveyed have an [[idiom]] referring to the tip of the tongue phenomenon that references the tongue, mouth, or throat as a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; The direct English translations of these idioms are "on the tongue", "on the tip/point/head of the tongue", "on the top of the tongue", "on the front of the tongue", "sparkling at the end of the tongue", and "in the mouth and throat".&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; Notably, the languages studied that did not have an equivalent idiom for the tip of the tongue were [[American Sign Language]], [[Amharic]], [[Icelandic (language)|Icelandic]], [[Indonesian (language)|Indonesian]], [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]], and [[Kiswahili]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;  However, tip of the finger experiences are reported by signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = R. | last2 = Emmorey | first2 = K. | last3 = Gollan | first3 = T. | year = 2005 | title = Tip-of-the-fingers experiences by ASL signers: insights into the organization of a sign-based lexicon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 856–860 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01626.x| pmid = 16262769 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.384.2100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

{{See also|#Influential factors|l1=Influential factors}}

The causes of TOTs are largely unknown but numerous explanations have been offered. These explanations mainly fall within the realms of two overarching viewpoints: the [[#Direct-access view|direct-access view]] and the [[#Inferential view|inferential view]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

=== Direct-access view ===

The '''direct-access view''' of the tip of the tongue phenomenon postulates that TOTs are experienced when memory strength for the item, while not strong enough to be recalled, has sufficient strength to signal a TOT state.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; That is, the rememberer has direct access to the target word's presence in memory, even though it cannot be immediately recalled. Theories of the causes of tip of the tongue phenomenon that adopt direct-access views include the [[#Blocking hypothesis|blocking hypothesis]], the [[#Incomplete activation hypothesis|incomplete activation hypothesis]], and the [[#Transmission deficit model|transmission deficit model]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

==== Blocking hypothesis ====

{{See also|Blocking effect}}

The blocking hypothesis states that retrieval cues elicit the retrieval of a word related to the target that then blocks the retrieval of the correct word and causes the tip of the tongue phenomenon to occur.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; In other words, TOTs occur when plausible but incorrect responses to a query come to mind quickly. The person recognizes that the related words are incorrect but cannot retrieve the correct word because it is inhibited.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;  These related words are termed blockers because they block the ability to retrieve the correct word.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; This accounts for why TOTs predict memory performance. Once the inhibition of the correct word is removed or the blockers are forgotten, the TOT will be resolved.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; Evidence for this [[hypothesis]] is minimal as it is difficult to measure.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; Most research that takes on this approach give participants blockers and see if they produce TOT states.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; This method is controversial as it is unclear if the blockers given produce TOT states or act as [[retrieval cue]]s.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

The hypothesis that blockers act more like retrieval cues is mainly supported by the idea of phonological similarities between the target word and the blocker word. Phonological blockers are words that sound similar to the target word. According to Bown &amp; Harley, “phonological neighbours (of blockers) usually act as support in lexical retrieval rather than as a hindrance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bown|first=H.|author2=Harley, T. |title=What causes a tip-of-the-tongue state? evidence for lexical neighbourhood effects in speech production|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1998|volume=89|issue=1|pages=151–174|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1998.tb02677.x}} Quote on page 164&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, there is also an argument that phonological blockers hinder the ability to retrieve the target word causing a tip of the tongue state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=G. V.|author2=Langford, S. |title=Phonological blocking in the tip of the tongue state|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=26|issue=2|pages=115–122|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027787900278|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is actually more support for the idea that blockers act as neither primers nor enhancers, but rather more like a side effect. In Metcalf &amp; Kornell’s research the incubation period helped participants to retrieve the word by the same amount for the original non-blocked TOTs and the blocked TOTs.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; This suggests that blockers have no effect on the retrieval or the causes of tip of the tongue states.

==== Incomplete-activation hypothesis ====

The incomplete activation hypothesis states that TOTs occur when the target word in memory is not sufficiently activated to be recalled but rememberers can sense its presence nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; The accessibility of the target word fluctuates due to factors that increase its activation level, such as cues.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; The target word's activation level may fluctuate to a level that is high enough for it to be retrieved and the TOT state to be resolved.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

==== Transmission-deficit model ====

The transmission deficit model is based on a multi-component theory of memory representation that suggests that [[semantic]] and [[phonological]] information is stored in memory and retrieved separately. The transmission deficit model posits that TOTs occur when there is activation of the semantic component of the target word memory but this activation does not pass on to the phonological level of the memory of the target word.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; Thus, TOTs are caused by the deficit in transmission of activation from the semantic memory store to the phonological memory store.&lt;ref name="Harley Bown 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=Trevor A.|last2=Bown|first2=Helen E.|title=What causes a tip-of-the-tongue state? Evidence for lexical neighbourhood effects in speech production|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=89|issue=1|year=1998|pages=151–174 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1998.tb02677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cognitive psychologists, Deborah M. Burke of Pomona College and Donald G. MacKay of the University of California, Los Angeles, this phenomenon occurs due to primarily three reasons, all surrounding the basis of weak neural connections.&lt;ref name="Abrams, Lise"&gt;Abrams, Lise. Tip-of-the-tongue states yield language insights; Probing the recall of those missing words provides a glimpse of how we turn thoughts into speech and how this process changes with age. ''American Scientist''. 96.3 (May–June 2008) p234.&lt;/ref&gt; One, the lack of frequent use of a word; two, if a word has not been in recent use; and three, aging.&lt;ref name="Abrams, Lise"/&gt;

=== Inferential view ===

The '''inferential view''' of TOTs claims that TOTs arise from clues about the target that the rememberer can piece together.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; This is to say that the rememberer [[infers]] their knowledge of the target word, and the imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.

==== Cue-familiarity theory ====

Cue-familiarity theory suggests that the strong feelings elicited by recognizing a familiar cue about the target word cause the tip of the tongue phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; A familiar cue should create a TOT state, whether or not the target word is known.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;  When one encounters a cue for a target word, the level of recognition is assessed, and a strong level of recognition will elicit a tip of the tongue state.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; It has been found that cues that are repetitive tend to create more TOTs than if one single cue is given.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; This might suggest that cue factors can play a role in causing TOT states.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt;

==== Accessibility heuristic ====

The accessibility [[heuristic]] states that TOTs are elicited by the quantity and strength of the information that is retrieved from memory when the target word itself is not.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1999"/&gt; When searching for a target word, the more information that is retrieved from memory, and the more the information retrieved is perceived to be related to the target word, the more likely a TOT state will be elicited.

== Phenomenon in the brain ==

=== Neuroimaging techniques used in the study of TOT ===

The body of research on the neurological mechanisms of the tip of the tongue phenomenon is limited. The research in this area has used [[magnetoencephalography]](MEG)&lt;ref name="Lindin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindin | first1 = M. | last2 = Diaz | first2 = F. | last3 = Capilla | first3 = A. | last4 = Ortiz | first4 = T. | last5 = Maestu | first5 = F. | year = 2010 | title = On the characterization of the spatio-temporal profiles of brain activity associated with face naming and the tip-of-the-tongue state: A magnetoencephalographic (MEG) study | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 48 | issue = 6| pages = 1757–1766 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.02.025 | pmid=20206189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and event-related [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Maril| first1=A.| last2=Simons| first2=JS.| last3=Weaver| first3=JJ.| last4=Schacter| first4=DL.| title=Graded recall success: an event-related fMRI comparison of tip of the tongue and feeling of knowing.| journal=NeuroImage| volume=24| issue=4| pages=1130–8|date=Feb 2005| doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.024| pmid=15670690| citeseerx=10.1.1.526.9629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kikyo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kikyo | first1 = H. | last2 = Ohki | first2 = K. | last3 = Sekihara | first3 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Temporal characterization of memory retrieval processes: an fMRI study of the 'tip of the tongue' phenomenon | url = | journal = European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 887–892 | doi=10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurological activation in the TOT state ===

[[File:Gray727 anterior cingulate cortex.png|thumb|The [[anterior cingulate cortex]] shows increased activation in TOT states]]

Several areas of the brain show increased activation in a TOT state. The following is a list of the specific structures that show increased activation during a tip of the tongue state:

* [[Anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC)&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kikyo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt;
* [[Posterior cingulate cortex]] (PCC)&lt;ref name="Kozlovskiy" /&gt;
* Right [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC)&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kikyo" /&gt;
* Right inferior [[prefrontal cortex]] (RIPC)&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;
* Bilateral anterior [[frontal cortex]]&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;
* Posterior medial [[parietal cortex]]&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;
* Bilateral lateral parietal cortex&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;
* Bilateral superior [[prefrontal cortex]]&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;
* [[Supramarginal gyrus]]&lt;ref name="Kikyo" /&gt;
* [[Superior temporal gyrus]]&lt;ref name="Kikyo" /&gt;
* [[Supplementary motor area]]&lt;ref name="Kikyo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt;
* Left [[insular cortex]]&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt;

It was also shown&lt;ref name="Kozlovskiy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozlovskiy|first1=S.A.|last2=Shirenova|first2=S.D.|last3=Neklyudova|first3=A.K.|last4=Vartanov|first4=A.V.|title=Brain mechanisms of the Tip-of-the-Tongue state:An electroencephalography-based source localization study|journal=Psychology in Russia: State of the Art|date=2017|volume=10|issue=3|pages=218–230|doi=10.11621/pir.2017.0315|url=http://psychologyinrussia.com/volumes/index.php?article=6669|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in TOT state the activation of the [[parahippocampal gyrus]] is decreased.

Not much is known about the exact function of these areas in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The areas activated during TOT may vary depending on the nature of the target word. For example, if the target word is a person's name, the [[fusiform face area]] will likely show activation as the rememberer processes the person's face. Problems like this make it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure.&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt; The anterior cingulate cortex is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.&lt;ref name="Maril 2005"/&gt;

== Influential factors ==

=== Effects of bilingualism ===

There is a significant difference in the amount of TOTs experienced by monolinguals and bilinguals.&lt;ref name="Gollan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gollan | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Bonanni | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Montoya | first3 = R. I. | year = 2005 | title = Proper names get stuck on bilingual and monolingual speakers' tip of the tongue equally often | url = | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 278–287 | doi=10.1037/0894-4105.19.3.278| pmid = 15910114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals seem to report the same amount of TOTs as monolinguals for proper names but significantly more TOTs for other words.&lt;ref name="Gollan" /&gt; Specifically, when adjusted for the degree of use of the dominant and less-dominant language, bilinguals have more TOTs with the less-dominant language.&lt;ref name="Gollan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hebrew"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gollan | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Silverberg | first2 = N. B. | year = 2001 | title = Tip-of-the-tongue states in Hebrew–English bilinguals | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 63–83 | doi = 10.1017/S136672890100013X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a task of picture-naming, bilingual speakers were slower than monolinguals, even when they could use their first and dominant language. This could possibly be the result of bilinguals using the words less often than monolingual speakers.&lt;ref name="Iva"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivanova | first1 = I. | last2 = Costa | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Does bilingualism hamper lexical access in speech production? | url = http://www.ehu.es/HEB/Mikel/Adam&amp;Mikel_Master2011_12/Papers%20for%20presentations/ivanova_costa%202008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 127 | issue = 2| pages = 277–288 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.06.003 | pmid=17662226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bilinguals also represent virtually twice as many words and additional cognitive mechanisms for activation and inactivation of languages. Such mechanisms introduce added processing burden that monolinguals do not face. In addition, even when a task seems monolingual, bilingual system is never functionally "off." &lt;ref name="Gollan"/&gt;

=== Effects of drugs ===

==== Lorazepam ====

[[Lorazepam]] is a type of [[benzodiazepine]], a [[psychoactive drug]] used for the short-term treatment of [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], acute [[seizures]] including status [[sedation]] of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of aggressive patients.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Bacon| first1=E.| last2=Schwartz| first2=BL.| last3=Paire-Ficout| first3=L.| last4=Izaute| first4=M.| title=Dissociation between the cognitive process and the phenomenological experience of TOT: effect of the anxiolytic drug lorazepam on TOT states.| journal=Conscious Cogn| volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=360–73|date=Jun 2007| doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.05.001| pmid=16798012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been conducted to investigate the effects of lorazepam on TOT states in response to general knowledge question. In a recall task, participants who received lorazepam showed the same number of total recall answers to participants who had not received lorazepam.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt;  However, the lorazepam participants produced more incorrect recall responses to their TOT states.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt; Lorazepam may inhibit the retrieval of the correct response.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt; Participants under the influence of lorazepam did not experience the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] feeling that they were in a TOT state (i.e., the feeling of being on the verge of recalling the word).&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt; These participants experienced the subjective feeling of a TOT state only after they were told that their response was incorrect.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt;  As a result, it appears that these participants are not aware that their answer is incorrect and only experience the subjective feeling of TOT states if they are told their answer is incorrect. Lorazepam may create conditions where alternative answers come to mind more easily.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt; Furthermore, lorazepam suppresses emotions, which may be why participants taking this drug do not experience the subjective feelings that accompany TOT states; thus enabling the recall of alternative responses.&lt;ref name="Bacon 2007"/&gt; These findings suggest that lorazepam does not increase the probability of TOT states but it does inhibit the retrieval of correct responses and the subjective feeling of TOT states, leading participants to give incorrect answers without being aware.

====Caffeine====

[[Caffeine]] can have multiple effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect that it has on people.&lt;ref name="Lesk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesk | first1 = V. E. | last2 = Womble | first2 = S. P. | year = 2004 | title = Caffeine, priming, and tip of the tongue: evidence for plasticity in the phonological system | url = | journal = Behavioural Neuroscience | volume = 118 | issue = 3| pages = 453–461 | doi=10.1037/0735-7044.118.3.453 | pmid=15174922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine or a placebo.&lt;ref name="Lesk" /&gt; The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 [[priming (psychology)|priming]] words that were displayed on a monitor for a short period of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated.&lt;ref name="Lesk" /&gt; Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Lesk" /&gt;

=== Effects of age ===

Age is an important factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years.&lt;ref name="Shafto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shafto | first1 = M. | last2 = Burke | first2 = D. | last3 = Stamatakis | first3 = E. | last4 = Tam | first4 = P. | last5 = Tyler | first5 = L. | year = 2007 | title = On the Tip-of-the-Tongue: Neural Correlates of increased Word-finding Failures in Normal Aging | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 2060–2070 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.12.2060| pmid = 17892392 | pmc = 2373253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = M. | last2 = Ober | first2 = B. | last3 = Shenaut | first3 = G. | year = 1999 | title = Naturally Occurring and Experimentally Induced Tip-of-the-Tongue Experiences in Three Adult Age Groups | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 445–457 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.14.3.445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Katherine K. | last2 = Abrams | first2 = Lise | year = 2002 | title = Does priming specific syllables during tip-of-the-tongue states facilitate word retrieval in older adults? | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 226–235 | doi=10.1037/0882-7974.17.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses [[neuroimaging]] methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], left [[insular cortex|insula]], and sensorimotor cortex.&lt;ref name="Shafto9"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shafto | first1 = M | last2 = Stamatatis | first2 = E. | last3 = Tam | first3 = Tyler | year = 2009 | title = Word Retrieval Failures in Old Age: The Relationship between Structure and Function | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 1530–1540 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21321 | pmid=19642890| citeseerx = 10.1.1.222.5809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals.&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt; TOTs increase with age-related [[gray matter]] loss in the left insula for older individuals.&lt;ref name="Shafto" /&gt;  This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is related to higher frequency of TOTs.&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt; Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states.&lt;ref name="Galdo-Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galdo-Alvarez | first1 = S. | last2 = Lindin | first2 = M. | last3 = Diaz | first3 = F. | year = 2009 | title = Age-related prefrontal over-recruitment in semantic memory retrieval: Evidence from successful face naming and tip of-the-tongue state | url = | journal = Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology | volume = 82 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2009.06.003| pmid = 19559070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may indicate a continued search when the retrieval process fails and a TOT state is experienced.&lt;ref name="Galdo-Alvarez" /&gt; More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information.&lt;ref name="Galdo-Alvarez" /&gt; [[Priming (psychology)|Priming]] words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit for older adults.&lt;ref name="Shafto9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafto" /&gt; This is consistent with the [[spreading activation]] model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more.&lt;ref name="Shafto" /&gt;  Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category,  recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Salthhouse, Timothy 2013"&gt;Salthhouse, Timothy, and Arielle Mandell. "Do Age-Related Increases in Tip-of-the-Tongue Experiences Signify Episodic Memory Impairments?." ''Psychological Science'' 2013; 10: n. pag. Sage Journals. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.&lt;ref name="Salthhouse, Timothy 2013"/&gt;

=== Effects of emotion ===

It is well documented that [[emotion]] influences many memory variables such as the amount of memory recalled and attributions of nostalgia.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; The issue regarding emotion and TOT is how it influences the tip-of-the-tongue state and the information that is trying to be recalled. It is common for individuals to ascribe emotions to TOTs.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; It is suggested that the majority of individuals experience TOTs negatively.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; It has been shown that experiencing an emotion predicts TOT memory performance later.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; Emotional TOTs are more likely to be recalled later than TOTs that had no emotional experience attached.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; Emotion and TOT are related to the [[metacognition|metacognitive theory]] that is mentioned above. In this theory, TOTs inform our cognitive system if the information we are trying to [[recall (memory)|recall]] is accessible.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; Thus, emotions may play a role in experiencing TOT. Some research has shown that questions that elicit emotional arousal create TOTs more so than questions that aren’t emotionally arousing.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt;  It has also been found that emotional arousal can extend to subsequent questions or information being recalled even if they are not emotionally arousing themselves.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; It was found that emotional arousal increased the likelihood of experiencing TOT.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] has also found activation in some areas that are associated with emotion; specifically in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010"/&gt;

=== Effects of disorders ===

If the inability to recall words, phrases, or names is a temporary but debilitating disorder, it is known as lethologica.

====Anomic aphasia====
[[Anomic aphasia]] is the inability to recall words and names and is a common symptom of patients with [[Aphasia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).&lt;ref name="Beeson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beeson | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Holland | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Murray | first3 = L.L. | year = 1997 | title = 'Naming famous people: An examination of tip-of-the-tongue phenomena in aphasia and Alzheimer's disease' | url = http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/1102/1/26-02.pdf| journal = Aphasiology | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 323–336 | doi=10.1080/02687039708248474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been conducted to find out how these particular diseases affect TOTs in these individuals. In a study by Beeson, Holland, and Murray (1997), participants with Alzheimer's disease and three classic aphasic syndromes (Broca’s, anomic, and conduction aphasia) were instructed to name famous people. Those with anomic aphasia showed to be superior to the other groups in their ability to naming famous people that were presented.&lt;ref name="Beeson" /&gt; This finding was expected as the group has relatively mild aphasia. However, the Broca’s conduction and AD groups did not differ in immediate or delayed naming of famous faces.&lt;ref name="Beeson" /&gt; All of the groups provided some basic identifying semantic information for at least half of the items presented, suggesting a fair number of items potentially in TOT.&lt;ref name="Beeson" /&gt; Conduction and Broca’s groups showed strongest evidence of TOT, performing better than the other groups in identification of initial letters.&lt;ref name="Beeson" /&gt;

====Dyslexia====
[[Dyslexia]], which is a reading disability in which a person is unable to read and interpret words, letters, and symbols, has also been known to have an effect on the frequency of TOT experiences. In one study, dyslexic children experienced TOT states more often than children who read normally as well as showed “more errors in the phonological […] step of word retrieval.” However, dyslexic children were still able to recall the semantic meaning behind each word that induced a TOT state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanly|first=Sarah|author2=Vandenberg, Brian |title=Tip-of-the-Tongue and Word Retrieval Deficits in Dyslexia|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=9 August 2009|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/08/03/0022219409338744.full.pdf|doi=10.1177/0022219409338744|pmid=19652018|volume=43|issue=1|pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of priming ===

Research on priming and practice use single word tests to assess for the presence of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and practice in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time.&lt;ref name="Rastle Burke 1996"/&gt; The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information.&lt;ref name="Rastle Burke 1996"/&gt; The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abrams | first1 = L. | last2 = Rodriguez | first2 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Syntactic Class Influences Phonological Priming of Tip-of-the-Tongue Resolution | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 1018–1023 | doi=10.3758/bf03206437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, they are more likely to overcome their TOT state.&lt;ref name="Rastle Burke 1996"/&gt; When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar [[phonology]] to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed.&lt;ref name="Askari"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Askari | first1 = N | year = 1999 | title = Priming Effects on Tip-of-the-tongue States in Farsi-English Bilinguals | url = | journal = Journal of Psycholinguistic Research | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 197–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the [[syntax|syntactic class]] of the priming word.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;

===Effects of gestures===
It is not yet known if gesturing helps or not in finding the word in a TOT experience. This is because it is unclear if the participant is using gestures as their regular form of communication that accompanies language or if they are using gestures in order to help them overcome their TOT experience and retrieve the target word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beattie | first1 = G | last2 = Coughlin | first2 = J | year = 1999 | title = An Experimental Investigation of the Role of Iconic Gestures In Lexical Access Using the Tip-of-the-Tongue Phenomenon | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 35–56| doi=10.1348/000712699161251 | pmid=10085545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of age of acquisition===
The speed and accuracy with which speakers retrieve a word is influenced by the age in life at which that word was first learned. Specifically, early-acquired words tend to be named more quickly and accurately than late-acquired words (age of acquisition effect). It has been observed that the probability of experiencing a TOT state depends on the age at which the word is acquired in life: more TOT states are obtained with late-acquired than with early-acquired words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarrete| first1 = E | last2 = Pastore| first2 = M | last3 = Valentini| first3 = R | last4 = Peressotti| first4 = P | year = 2015 |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">'''Transcendental anatomy''', also known as '''philosophical anatomy''', was a form of [[comparative anatomy]] that sought to find ideal patterns and structures common to all organisms in nature.&lt;ref name="Bates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Bates|title=The Anatomy of Robert Knox: Murder, Mad Science and Medical Regulation in Nineteenth-Century Edinburgh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1kBF3mfIZMC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-381-2|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated from [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist philosophy]] in the German provinces, and culminated in Britain especially by scholars [[Robert Knox]] and [[Richard Owen]], who drew from [[Goethe]] and [[Lorenz Oken]].&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; From the 1820s to 1859, it persisted as the medical expression of natural philosophy before the [[Darwinian_revolution#1859.E2.80.931930s:_Darwin_and_his_legacy|Darwinian revolution]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janis McLarren Caldwell|title=Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: From Mary Shelley to George Eliot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPvTSjOmYooC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=18 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45664-7|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst its various definitions, transcendental anatomy has four main tenets:
* the presupposition of an Ideal Plan among the multiplicity of visible structures in the animal and plant kingdom, and that the Plan determines function 
* the Ideal Plan acted as a force for the maintenance of anatomical uniformity (as opposed to diversity-inducing forces of Nature)
* the belief that this ''a priori'' Plan was discoverable
* the desire to discover universal Laws underlying anatomical differences.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==History==
Johann Wolfgang Goethe was one of many naturalists and anatomists in the nineteenth century who was in search of an Ideal Plan in nature. In Germany, this was known as ''Urpflanze'' for the plant kingdom and ''Urtier'' for animals. He popularized the term "[[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]" for this search. Transcendental anatomy first derived from the naturalist philosophy known as ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref name="Richards2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Richards|title=The Meaning of Evolution: The Morphological Construction and Ideological Reconstruction of Darwin's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-72dKSIciEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=2 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71205-5|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s, French anatomist Etienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786–1868) popularized the term ''transcendental anatomy'' to refer to the collective morphological of animal development.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Romanticism and the Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=28 June 1990|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-35685-5|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonymous expressions such as philosophical anatomy, higher anatomy, and transcendental morphology also arose at this time.

Some advocates regarded transcendental anatomy as the ultimate explanation for biological structures, while others saw it as one of several necessary explanatory devices.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==Vertebral theory==
[[File:SkullFromTheFront.JPG|150px|thumbnail|right|The osteology of the human skull was an important theory for transcendental anatomists.]]
Transcendental anatomists theorized that the bones of the skull were "cranial vertebra", or modified bones from the vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; Owen ardently supported the theory as major evidence for his theory of [[homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref name="Gregorio2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario a Di Gregorio|title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZK004HREqgC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-56972-6|pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has since been discredited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19883">In [[decision theory]], the '''von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem''' shows that, under certain [[axiom]]s of [[rationality|rational behavior]], a decision-maker faced with [[risk]]y (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the [[expected value]] of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future. This function is known as the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for [[expected utility theory]].

In 1947, [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] proved that any individual whose [[preference (economics)|preferences]] satisfied four axioms has a [[utility function]];&lt;ref name="VNM"&gt;[[John von Neumann|Neumann, John von]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern, Oskar]], ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]''. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; such an individual's preferences can be represented on an [[interval scale]] and the individual will always prefer actions that maximize expected utility. That is, they proved that an agent is (VNM-)rational ''if and only if'' there exists a real-valued function ''u'' defined by possible outcomes such that every preference of the agent is characterized by maximizing the expected value of ''u'', which can then be defined as the agent's ''VNM-utility'' (it is unique up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar). No claim is made that the agent has a "conscious desire" to maximize ''u'', only that ''u'' exists.

Any individual whose preferences violate von Neumann and Morgenstern's axioms would agree to a [[Dutch book]], which is a set of bets that necessarily leads to a loss. Therefore, it is arguable that any individual who violates the axioms is irrational.  The [[expected utility hypothesis]] is that rationality can be modeled as maximizing an [[expected value]], which given the theorem, can be summarized as "''rationality is VNM-rationality''".

VNM-utility is a ''decision utility'' in that it is used to describe ''decision preferences''. It is related but not equivalent to so-called ''E-utilities''&lt;ref name="KWS"&gt;Kahneman, Wakker and Sarin, 1997, ''Back to Bentham? Explorations of experienced utility'', The quarterly journal of economics.&lt;/ref&gt; (experience utilities), notions of utility intended to measure happiness such as that of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[Greatest happiness principle|Greatest Happiness Principle]].

== Set-up ==
In the theorem, an individual agent is faced with options called ''lotteries''. Given some [[mutually exclusive]] outcomes, a lottery is a scenario where each outcome will happen with a given [[probability]], all probabilities summing to one. For example, for two outcomes ''A'' and ''B'',

::&lt;math&gt;L = 0.25A + 0.75B &lt;/math&gt;

denotes a scenario where ''P''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;25% is the probability of ''A'' occurring and ''P''(''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;75% (and exactly one of them will occur).  More generally, for a lottery with many possible outcomes ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', we write

::&lt;math&gt;
L = \sum p_i A_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum of the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;s equalling 1.

The outcomes in a lottery can themselves be lotteries between other outcomes, and the expanded expression is considered an equivalent lottery: 0.5(0.5''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5''B'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5''C'' =&amp;nbsp;0.25''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.25''B''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.50''C''.

If lottery ''M'' is preferred over lottery ''L'', we write &lt;math&gt;L \prec M&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;M \succ L&lt;/math&gt;.  If the agent is indifferent between ''L'' and&amp;nbsp;''M'', we write the ''indifference relation''&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David M.]] ''Notes on the Theory of Choice''. Westview Press (May 12, 1988), chapters 2 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;L\sim M.&lt;/math&gt; If ''M'' is either preferred over or viewed with indifference relative to ''L'', we write &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M.&lt;/math&gt;

== The axioms ==
The four axioms of VNM-rationality are then ''completeness'', ''transitivity'', ''continuity'', and ''independence''.

Completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences:

:'''Axiom 1 (Completeness)''' For any lotteries ''L,M'', exactly one of the following holds:

::&lt;math&gt;\, L\prec M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\, M\prec L&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\, L \sim M  &lt;/math&gt;

(either ''M'' is preferred, ''L'' is preferred, or the individual is indifferent&lt;ref name="nop"&gt;Implicit in denoting indifference by equality are assertions like if &lt;math&gt;L\prec M = N&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;L\prec N&lt;/math&gt;.  To make such relations explicit in the axioms, Kreps (1988) chapter 2 denotes indifference by &lt;math&gt;\,\sim&lt;/math&gt;, so it may be surveyed in brief for intuitive meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]] assumes that preferences are consistent across any three options:

:'''Axiom 2 (Transitivity)''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,M \prec N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec N&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;.

Continuity assumes that there is a "tipping point" between being ''better than'' and ''worse than'' a given middle option:

:'''Axiom 3 (Continuity):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \preceq M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a probability &lt;math&gt;\,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\,pL + (1-p)N\, \sim \,M&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation on the left side refers to a situation in which ''L'' is received with probability ''p'' and ''N'' is received with probability (1–''p'').

Instead of continuity, an alternative axiom can be assumed that does not involve a precise equality, called the [[Archimedean property]].&lt;ref name="Kreps" /&gt;  It says that any separation in preference can be maintained under a sufficiently small deviation in probabilities:

:'''Axiom 3′ (Archimedean property):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec M\prec N&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a probability &lt;math&gt;\,\varepsilon\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; such that

::&lt;math&gt;\,(1-\varepsilon)L + \varepsilon N\, \prec \,M \, \prec \,\varepsilon L + (1-\varepsilon)N.&lt;/math&gt;

Only one of (3) and (3′) need be assumed, and the other will be implied by the theorem.

[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] assumes that a preference holds independently of the possibility of another outcome:

:'''Axiom 4 (Independence):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;\,N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\,pL+(1-p)N \preceq pM+(1-p)N.&lt;/math&gt;

The independence axiom implies the axiom on reduction of compound lotteries:&lt;ref&gt;EconPort, "Von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility Theory" http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/decisions-uncertainty/basic/von.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Axiom 4′ (Reduction of compound lotteries):''' For any lotteries &lt;math&gt;L, L', N&lt;/math&gt; any &lt;math&gt;p, q \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, 

:: &lt;math&gt;if \qquad L\sim qL'+(1-q)N,&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;then \quad pL+(1-p)N \sim pqL'+(1-pq)N.&lt;/math&gt;

To see how Axiom 4 implies Axiom 4', set &lt;math&gt;M = qL'+(1-q)N&lt;/math&gt; in the expression in Axiom 4, and expand.

== The theorem ==
For any VNM-rational agent (i.e. satisfying axioms 1–4), there exists a function ''u'' which assigns to each outcome ''A'' a real number ''u(A)'' such that for any two lotteries,

::&lt;math&gt;L\prec M \qquad \mathrm{if \, and \, only \, if} \qquad E(u(L)) &lt; E(u(M)), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E(u(L))'', or more briefly ''Eu''(''L'') is given by

::&lt;math&gt;Eu(p_1A_1 + \ldots + p_nA_n) = p_1u(A_1) + \cdots + p_nu(A_n). &lt;/math&gt;

As such, ''u'' can be uniquely determined (up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar) by preferences between ''simple lotteries'', meaning those of the form ''pA''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')''B'' having only two outcomes.  Conversely, any agent acting to maximize the expectation of a function ''u'' will obey axioms 1–4.  Such a function is called the agent's '''von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) utility'''.

=== Proof sketch ===
&lt;div id='construction'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The proof is constructive: it shows how the desired function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; can be built. Here we outline the construction process for the case in which the number of sure outcomes is finite.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993&gt;{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132–134}}

Suppose there are ''n'' sure outcomes, &lt;math&gt;A_1\dots A_n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that every sure outcome can be seen as a lottery: it is a degenerate lottery in which the outcome is selected with probability 1. Hence, by the Completeness axiom, it is possible to order the outcomes from worst to best:
:&lt;math&gt;A_1\preceq A_2\preceq \cdots \preceq A_n&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that at least one of the inequalities is strict (otherwise the utility function is trivial—a constant). So &lt;math&gt;A_1\prec A_n&lt;/math&gt;. We use these two extreme outcomes—the worst and the best—as the scaling unit of our utility function, and define:

:&lt;math&gt;u(A_1)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(A_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;

For every probability &lt;math&gt;p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, define a lottery that selects the best outcome with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the worst outcome otherwise:
:&lt;math&gt;L(p) = p\cdot A_n + (1-p)\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;L(0)\sim A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(1)\sim A_n&lt;/math&gt;.

By the Continuity axiom, for every sure outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;, there is a probability &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;L(q_i) \sim A_i&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;0 = q_1\leq q_2\leq \cdots \leq q_n = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the utility function for outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;u(A_i)=q_i&lt;/math&gt;

so the utility of every lottery &lt;math&gt;M=\sum_i{p_i A_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the expectation of ''u'':
:&lt;math&gt;u(M) = u(\sum_i{p_i A_i}) = \sum_i{p_i u(A_i)} = \sum_i{p_i q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

To see why this utility function make sense, consider a lottery &lt;math&gt;M = \sum_i{p_i A_i}&lt;/math&gt;, which selects outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;. But, by our assumption, the decision maker is indifferent between the sure outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and the lottery &lt;math&gt;q_i\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;. So, by the Reduction axiom, he is indifferent between the lottery &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the following lottery:
:&lt;math&gt;M' = \sum_i{p_i [q_i\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\cdot A_1]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M' = (\sum_i{p_i q_i})\cdot A_n + (\sum_i{p_i(1-q_i)})\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M' = u(M)\cdot A_n + (1-u(M))\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
The lottery &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; is, in effect, a lottery in which the best outcome is won with probability &lt;math&gt;u(M)&lt;/math&gt;, and the worst outcome otherwise.

Hence, if &lt;math&gt;u(M)&gt;u(L)&lt;/math&gt;, a rational decision maker would prefer the lottery &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; over the lottery &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, because it gives him a larger chance to win the best outcome.

Hence:
::&lt;math&gt;L\prec M \; &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; E(u(L)) &lt; E(u(M)).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reaction ===
Von Neumann and Morgenstern anticipated surprise at the strength of their conclusion.  But according to them, the reason their utility function works is that it is constructed precisely to fill the role of something whose expectation is maximized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Many economists will feel that we are assuming far too much ... Have we not shown too much? ... As far as we can see, our postulates [are] plausible ... We have practically defined numerical utility as being that thing for which the calculus of mathematical expectations is legitimate."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953, §&amp;nbsp;3.1.1 p.16 and §&amp;nbsp;3.7.1 p. 28''&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the content of the theorem is that the construction of ''u'' is possible, and they claim little about its nature.

== Consequences ==

=== Automatic consideration of risk aversion ===
{{Main|Risk aversion}}

It is often the case that a person, faced with real-world [[gamble]]s with money, does not act to maximize the expected value of their ''dollar assets.''  For example, a person who only possesses $1000 in savings may be reluctant to risk it all for a 20% chance odds to win $10,000, even though

:&lt;math&gt;20\%(\$10\,000)+80\%(\$0) = \$2000 &gt; 100\%(\$1000)&lt;/math&gt;

However, ''if'' the person is VNM-rational, such facts are automatically accounted for in their utility function ''u''.  In this example, we could conclude that

:&lt;math&gt;20\%u(\$10\,000)+80\%u(\$0) &lt; u(\$1000)&lt;/math&gt;

where the dollar amounts here really represent ''outcomes'' (cf. "''[[Value theory|value]]''"), the three possible situations the individual could face.  In particular, ''u'' can exhibit properties like ''u''($1)+''u''($1) ≠ ''u''($2) without contradicting VNM-rationality at all.  This leads to a quantitative theory of [[risk aversion#Absolute risk aversion|monetary risk aversion.]]

=== Implications for the expected utility hypothesis ===
{{Main|Expected utility hypothesis}}

In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published a treatise&lt;ref&gt;''Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis'' or ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he posits that rational behavior can be described as maximizing the expectation of a function ''u'', which in particular need not be monetary-valued, thus accounting for risk aversion.  This is the ''expected utility hypothesis''.  As stated, the hypothesis may appear to be a bold claim.  The aim of the ''expected utility theorem'' is to provide "modest conditions" (i.e. axioms) describing when the expected utility hypothesis holds, which can be evaluated directly and intuitively:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple and transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness may be judged directly.  In a situation like ours this last requirement is particularly vital, in spite of its vagueness: we want to make an intuitive concept amenable to mathematical treatment and to see as clearly as
possible what hypotheses this requires."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953 §&amp;nbsp;3.5.2, p. 25''&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, claims that the expected utility hypothesis does not characterize rationality must reject one of the VNM axioms.  A variety of [[generalized expected utility]] theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.

=== Implications for ethics and moral philosophy ===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}

Because the theorem assumes nothing about the nature of the possible outcomes of the gambles, they could be morally significant events, for instance involving the life, death, sickness, or health of others.  A von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent is capable of acting with great concern for such events, sacrificing much personal wealth or well-being, and all of these actions will factor into the construction/definition of the agent's VNM-utility function.  In other words, both what is naturally perceived as "personal gain", and what is naturally perceived as "altruism", are implicitly balanced in the VNM-utility function of a VNM-rational individual.  Therefore, the full range of [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focussed to agent-neutral]] behaviors are {{clarify|text=possible with various VNM-utility functions|date=March 2016}}.

If the utility of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;pM&lt;/math&gt;, a von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent must be indifferent between &lt;math&gt;1N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;pM+(1-p)0&lt;/math&gt;. An agent-focused von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent therefore cannot favor more equal, or "fair", distributions of utility between its own possible future selves.

=== Distinctness from other notions of utility ===
Some [[Utilitarianism#Average v total|utilitarian moral theories]] are concerned with quantities called the "total utility" and "average utility" of collectives, and characterize morality in terms of favoring the utility or happiness of others with disregard for one's own.  These notions can be related to, but are distinct from, VNM-utility:
* 1) VNM-utility is a ''decision utility'':&lt;ref name="KWS" /&gt; it is that according to which one decides, and thus by definition cannot be something which one disregards.
* 2) VNM-utility is not canonically additive across multiple individuals (see Limitations), so "total VNM-utility" and "average VNM-utility" are not immediately meaningful (some sort of normalization assumption is required).

The term ''E-utility'' for "experience utility" has been coined&lt;ref name="KWS" /&gt; to refer to the types of "hedonistic" utility like that of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[greatest happiness principle]].  Since morality affects decisions, a VNM-rational agent's morals will affect the definition of its own utility function (see above).  Thus, the morality of a VNM-rational agent can be characterized by ''correlation'' of the agent's VNM-utility with the VNM-utility, E-utility, or "happiness" of others, among other means, but not by ''disregard'' for the agent's own VNM-utility, a contradiction in terms.

== Limitations ==

=== Nested gambling ===
Since if ''L'' and ''M'' are lotteries, then ''pL''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')''M'' is simply "expanded out" and considered a lottery itself, the VNM formalism ignores what may be experienced as "nested gambling".  This is related to the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg problem]] where people choose to avoid the perception of ''risks about risks''.  Von Neumann and Morgenstern recognized this limitation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...concepts like a ''specific utility of gambling'' cannot be formulated free of contradiction on this level.  This may seem to be a paradoxical assertion.  But anybody who has seriously tried to axiomatize that elusive concept, will probably concur with it."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953 §&amp;nbsp;3.7.1, p. 28''.&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Incomparability between agents ===
Since for any two VNM-agents ''X'' and ''Y'', their VNM-utility functions ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are only determined up to additive constants and multiplicative positive scalars, the theorem does not provide any canonical way to compare the two.  Hence expressions like ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') + ''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') and ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') are not canonically defined, nor are comparisons like ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') canonically true or false.  In particular, the aforementioned "total VNM-utility" and "average VNM-utility" of a population are not canonically meaningful without normalization assumptions.

=== Applicability to economics ===
The [[expected utility hypothesis]], as applied to economics, has limited predictive accuracy, simply because in practice, humans do not always behave VNM-rationally. This is manifested in several experimental outcomes such as the [[Allais paradox]].
This can be interpreted as evidence that
* humans are not always rational, or
* VNM-rationality is not an appropriate characterization of rationality, or
* some combination of both, or
* humans ''do'' behave VNM-rationally but the objective evaluation of ''u'' and the construction of ''u'' are [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] problems.

'''''Wén''''' 文 and '''''wǔ''''' 武 - a conceptual pair in [[Chinese philosophy]] and political culture describing opposition and complementarity of civil ① and military ② realms of government. Differentiation between ''wen'' and ''wu'' was engaged in discussions on criminal punishment, administrative control, creation and reproduction of social order, education and moral transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was formed during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Chunqiu]] and [[Warring States]] periods, and best articulated in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE. However, until recently it was not much discussed by the Western scholars because of ① their aberrated perception of the importance of [[Confucianism]] in the pre-imperial and early imperial era, and ② their understanding of Confucianism as pacifist in its nature.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the last is provided by [[John K. Fairbank]]: “Warfare was disesteemed in Confucianism... The resort to warfare (''wu'') was an admission of bankruptcy in the pursuit of ''wen'' [civility or culture]. Consequently, it should be a last resort... Herein lies the pacifist bias of the Chinese tradition... Expansion through ''wen''... was natural and proper; whereas expansion by ''wu'', brute force and conquest, was never to be condoned.”&lt;ref&gt;Yuan-kang Wang, ''Harmony and war: Confucian culture and Chinese power politics''.

The [[posthumous name]]s of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) founders, [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], represent the two terms as standing in the "father-and-son" relationship. Since the [[Battle of Muye|conquest of Shang]] and creation of the Zhou imperial order were the most discussed events of the classical era, the two impersonated terms had very broad currency. However, their origin is presently impossible to pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Garden of Stories|Shuoyuan]]'', compiled by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-6 BCE, Han dynasty), gives a classical example of the terms' balancing against each other: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] enfeoffed [[Bo Qin]] [the Duke of Zhou's son] as the Duke of Lu. Summoning him, he addressed him, saying: "Do you know the Way of acting as the ruler over the people? ... Should you possess the civil but lack the martial, you will have no means to awe those below. Should you possess the martial but lack the civil, the people will fear you but not draw close. If the civil and martial are implemented together, then your awe-inspiring [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] will be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 15, translating from "Jundao" chapter of the ''Shuoyuan''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12910">The '''World Courts of Women''' are public hearings that give a forum to those who are traditionally excluded from formal political and legal proceedings. Organized around particular topics relevant to the hosting country, these unofficial public enquiries highlight the injustices that women face. They include testimonies of personal experience, analyses by scholars and activists, and skill-sharing and strategizing. Through these, the World Courts aim to educate and raise awareness, record injustice and human rights violations, give voice to marginalized women, and develop alternative visions and strategies for the future.

==Overview==

World Courts of Women are symbolic processes that hold [[Unofficial hearing|unofficial public enquiries]] into crimes against women, including the violation of their basic [[human rights]]. The main function of these hearings is to allow an opportunity for participants to relate experiences that are not widely publicized by traditional media sources and [[public discourse]]. It aims to challenge dominant public discourse by pointing to contradictions between principles of human rights and the experiences of women. The secondary function is for the [[testimony]] to provide a resource for [[social movements]] and [[political movements]] working for [[social justice]] and [[women's liberation]], which seek to hold powerful governments and other entities accountable to human rights standards and [[international law]] and "transform the dominant paradigm of politics." &lt;ref name="Courts of Women"/&gt;

The World Courts of Women have been inspired and promoted by Corinne Kumar, an [[activist]] leader in the Tunis-based [[non-governmental organization]] and human rights advocacy group, El Taller International.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women1"/&gt; In the countries where these occur, the intent is to hold their governments accountable to both international law and human [[ethics]]. While such courts lack [[Legitimacy (political)|official legitimacy]], by pointing out the failures of formal laws to protect women, they can help undermine the popular acceptance of government authority that is based in [[patriarchy]]. In this sense, they aim to increase [[popular sovereignty]] and to delegitimize institutions, [[bureaucracy]], and other social groups which are thought to be inadequate in punishing persons who violate the ethics and [[Norm (social)|norms]], if not also the [[Law|formal laws]], governing society. They challenge the traditional notion of power and powerholders; according to Kumar, "moving out of the patriarchal mindset would mean refusing the mono-dimensional definition of power, seeking to redefine and relocate power, to discover an alternate concept of power, to find new patterns of power."&lt;ref name="Women, Violence, and Nonviolent Change"/&gt;

There are many gender biases’ in the courts especially against women. Women can be denied equal justice, equal treatment, and equal opportunity (Harbour). Women have had laws passed to protect them against violence. It took many years to actually allow them to recognize women as victims of stalking or sexual harassment. Eventually laws were passed to protect these victims. Many women have experienced and lived through the domestic violence that was done to them and no one believed them. Now society is finally recognizing the violence against women more than ever before. Even though women are still put down compared to men in certain situations or jobs the world has evolved to better the understanding that women are just as capable as men.

== People's tribunals ==

[[Tribunal|People’s tribunals]] assert that targeted judicial systems are failing to provide access for low-income, minority, and other non-elite groups and individuals to [[prosecute]] or even bring forth a [[criminal charge]]. Investigation is also made into laws recognized by states that fail to consider [[personal and cultural values]] of [[human rights]] and [[dignity]]. These tribunals are also intended to help strengthen international conventions or norms to which governments and other [[elites]] are held.&lt;ref name="People's Tribunals as Constructive Resistance"/&gt;

The [[social space]]s where the World Courts of Women occur are [[communities]] in which "social categories are suspended, [[social roles|roles]] become fluid and [[social interaction|interaction]] is privileged."&lt;ref name="The Courts of Women"/&gt;  The [[symbolic system|symbolic]] use of the World Courts of Women intends to provide [[social influence|influence]], [[people power|power]], and [[Standing (law)|standing]] for victims unable to find resolution in official judicial systems and institutions.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women2"/&gt;

The first [[International War Crimes Tribunal]] was an investigative body immediately followed the 1966 publication of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book, ''War Crimes in Vietnam''.  The tribunal investigated and evaluated the United States of [[criticism of American foreign policy|America's foreign policy]] and military [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and provided a model for further tribunals related to [[war crimes]], [[human rights violations]], and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell: Critical Assessments, Volume 1,"/&gt;

The [[International Tribunal on Crimes against Women]] was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book"/&gt;

== History ==

What follows is a partial list of past World Courts.

In 1992 the first World Court of Women, called the "Asia Court on Violence Against Women" was held in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. The Courts of Women organized by Asian Women's Human Rights Council (AWHRC) in the [[Asia Pacific region]] inspired courts in other regions, particularly in the [[Arab world]], [[Africa]], and [[Central America]].  In 1995 Arab women organized the Arab Women's Court with the assistance of human rights organizations including the international NGO, El Taller.  That year the court held a public hearing in [[Beirut, Lebanon]] on violence directed against women. In 1996 the ''Mahkamate El Nissa El Arabiya'' (Permanent Arab Women’s Court) was established.  Different member organizations were to host this court on a rotating basis.&lt;ref name="Arab World"/&gt;

The [[Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery]] was held in December 2000. It was a people's tribunal convened to gather testimony from victims, and then, based on [[international criminal law|international laws]] that were in place during [[World War II]], to try groups and individuals for [[rape]] or [[sexual slavery]], i.e., forcing women to sexually service Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name="Did NHK Balk at Covering War Tribunal?"/&gt;
  
The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace was held March 8, 2001 in [[Khayelitsha]], Cape Town, South Africa to bear witness to the enormous violence and [[genocide]] caused by wars around the world. 4,000 people from around the Republic of South Africa and the world participated.&lt;ref name="The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace"/&gt;

World Court of Women on U.S. War Crimes took place in [[Mumbai]], India, on January 18, 2004, as part of the 2004 [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref name="World Court of Women on US War Crimes"/&gt;

The 36th Court of Women, "Daughters of Fire : The Indian Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women" was held in [[Bangalore]], India on July 26–29, 2009.&lt;ref name="Background: India Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women"/&gt;

The 37th Court of Women, "Southeast Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking" was held on August 6, 2009 during the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in [[Nusa Dua]], Bali. Twenty-two women, from six Southeast Asian countries ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], the [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Singapore]]) spoke about living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and their experiences with [[human trafficking]], [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]], and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="Survivors seek justice from podium"/&gt;

"World Court of Women on Poverty in the United States: Disappeared in America" was the first US example, held in [[Oakland, California]], USA, from May 10–13, 2012. Representing the western region of the country, the focus was on poverty in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Let's Make Poverty History"/&gt;

In 2013, another World Court of Women was held in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia 2013"/&gt;

The 2015 session took place in Bangalore, India, to witness the violence and injustice, and highlight the political lessons and resistance, and oppose "the unending wars against women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Courts of Women: against war, for peace|url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/rebecca-johnson/courts-of-women-resisting-violence-and-war|website = openDemocracy|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7986">[[Image:ISS gyroscope.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Zero-propellant maneuvers can be achieved by carefully planning and commanding operations with [[attitude control]] devices such as this [[Control Moment Gyroscope]] for the [[International Space Station]]]]
A '''zero-propellant maneuver''' (ZPM) is an optimal attitude trajectory used to perform spacecraft rotational control without the need to use thrusters. ZPMs are designed for spacecraft that use momentum storage actuators. Spacecraft ZPMs are used to perform large angle rotations or rate damping (detumbling) without saturating momentum actuators, and momentum dumping (from storage) without thrusters.

==Background==
Spacecraft rotational operations, such as turning to point in a new direction, are usually performed by [[angular momentum]] storage devices such as [[reaction wheels]] or [[control moment gyroscope]]s. It is generally preferable to use these devices instead of traditional [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]], as they are powered by renewable electricity instead of by propellant; firing thrusters uses up the fixed amount of propellant on the spacecraft. Propellant is very costly because it must be carried from earth; once it is used up, the spacecraft's life is over. Therefore, the operational life of the spacecraft is determined by the amount of propellant carried, and the rate at which the propellant is used up. Propellant is used for two main purposes: to maintain the spacecraft in orbit, and to control rotation. Therefore, the less propellant that has to be used for controlling rotation, the more that is available for maintaining orbit, and the longer the lifetime of the spacecraft.

However, momentum storage devices have a limited capacity, and that capacity soon becomes saturated when they are required to absorb spacecraft disturbance torques caused by ([[gravity gradient]], [[solar wind]], and [[aerodynamic drag]]); when in other words they reach their momentum storage limit. Once saturation is reached, momentum storage devices cannot apply torque to control the spacecraft's orientation. The spacecraft then typically requires thrusters using propellant to 'desaturate' the storage devices, in other words to unload the accumulated momentum, and so to restore the spacecraft's full ability to carry out rotational operations.

Spacecraft experience [[orbital decay]] due to [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]. To maintain their orbit, thrusters are used to [[reboost]] the spacecraft to a higher altitude. Because on board propellant capacity is limited, the spacecraft can only perform a limited number of momentum desaturations or reboosts. Therefore, if momentum desaturations can be reduced or eliminated, a larger fraction of propellant can be used to maintain the spacecraft in its desired [[orbit]], and it will have a longer operational lifetime.

Typically spacecraft rotations are performed as [[quaternion]] rotations or about a fixed axis ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]) usually referred to as an eigenaxis. Rotations about an eigenaxis result in the smallest angle between two orientations. Moreover, eigenaxis rotations are performed with a fixed rotation rate or maneuver rate. However, to maintain the spacecraft rotation about the eigenaxis, and at a fixed maneuver rate, requires the momentum storage actuators to overcome disturbance torques acting on the spacecraft. Depending on the intensity of the disturbances, the size of rotation and momentum storage device capacity, momentum storage devices can become saturated even if the spacecraft is rotated at a small maneuver rate.

Fortunately, however, the choice of rotation path impacts the spacecraft performance. This enables ZPMs to offer a new way to perform spacecraft rotations. Unlike eigenaxis smallest angle rotations, ZPMs are larger angle but minimum fuel rotations. Unlike eigenaxis fixed axis and maneuver rate rotations, ZPM rotations vary the rotation axis and maneuver rate during the maneuver. Just like eigenaxis rotations, ZPM rotations can be generated by commanding the spacecraft with a time varying attitude and rate command. However, ZPM rotations require significantly more time than eigenaxis rotations.  ZPM trajectories can also be used to reduce propellant consumption even when the spacecraft uses thrusters instead of momentum storage devices. This application is referred to as a Reduced Propellant Maneuver (RPM) since even though propellant use is minimized some propellant will have to be used.

==Theory==
A ZPM is a non-eigenaxis attitude trajectory that exploits the spacecraft environmental dynamics (e.g. gravity gradient, solar pressure, aerodynamics etc.) to eliminate the need for mass expulsion actuators during rotational operations.&lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, W. Kang, [[I. Michael Ross|I. M. Ross]], "Zero Propellant Maneuver Guidance," IEEE Control Systems Magazine, Vol. 29, Issue 5, October 2009, pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, and S. Bhatt, "Space Station Zero Propellant Maneuver Guidance Trajectories Compared to Eigenaxis," Proceedings of the American Control Conference, 2008, pp. 4833–4838.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZPMs are developed by solving a specific nonlinear two-point-boundary-value optimal control problem for a fixed maneuver end time. Whereas an eigenaxis maneuver maintains a constant rotation axis and maneuver rate, a ZPM uses a time varying rotation axis and maneuver rate. An eigenaxis maneuver attitude trajectory tries to overcome disturbances to maintain a constant maneuver rate, which results in saturating the momentum storage devices. By using a variable maneuver rate, ZPMs avoid saturation of momentum storage actuators.

A simplified model for a spacecraft ZPM is a sailboat. A sailboat tacks against the wind to travel in a zig-zag manner without using its outboard motors thus not using any propellant. The sailboat takes advantage of the winds just like ZPM takes advantage of spacecraft environmental disturbances. The sailboat does not take the shortest path to travel from one location to the other. Similarly, a ZPM does not take the shortest angular path between two orientations. One can think of the sailboat rudder as the equivalent of the momentum storage actuators on a spacecraft.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Applications==
ZPMs were demonstrated on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "Fact Sheet: International Space Station Zero-Propellant Maneuver (ZPM) Demonstration." June 10, 2011. (Sept. 13, 2011) http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/ZPM.html&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2006, the ISS performed a 90 degree ZPM &lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, M. Lammers, L. Nguyen, and Y. Zhang, "First Ever Flight Demonstration of Zero Propellant Maneuver Attitude Control Concept," Proceedings of the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, 2007, AIAA 2007–6734.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2 hours, while on March 3, 2007 the ISS performed a 180 degree ZPM &lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, M. Lammers, and L. Nguyen, "Zero Propellant Maneuver Flight Results for 180° ISS Rotation," Proceedings of the International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics, 2007, NASA/CP-2007-214158.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2 hours and 47 minutes. The ZPM [[optimal control]] problems for both ISS maneuvers were solved using [[DIDO (software)|DIDO]] software.

==History==

The 90° ISS ZPM was developed by Sagar Bhatt for his Master's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bhatt, "Optimal Reorientation of Spacecraft Using Only Control Moment Gyroscopes," Master's Thesis, Dept. of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
