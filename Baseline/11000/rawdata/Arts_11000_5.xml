'''Academie Minerva''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Art school|art academy]].

The academy was founded in 1798 in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] as a school for [[arts]],  [[architecture]], [[construction engineering]], and [[seamanship]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijk, F. van (1998) ''Leraren van de Academie Minerva. Een keuze uit twee eeuwen kunstonderwijs in Groningen'' Groningen: Benjamin &amp; Partners&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a school for [[fine art]] and [[design]] and part of the [[Hanze University Groningen]]. It offers two main fields: Fine Art and Design and Teacher Training in Fine Art and Design. The [[Leeuwarden]] based [[Academy for Pop Culture]] is also part of the Academie Minerva. This study has two directions, [[popular music]] and [[design]].

[[File:Alciphron (1732) title page.jpg|thumb|''Alciphron'' title page (1732).]]
'''''Alciphron''''', or '''''The Minute Philosopher''''' is an [[anticatholic]] philosophical [[dialogue]] by the 18th-century Irish philosopher [[George Berkeley]] wherein Berkeley combated the arguments of [[free-thinkers]] such as [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] against the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religion]]. It was first published in 1732.

The dialogue is primarily between four characters, the free-thinkers Alciphron and Lysicles, Berkeley's spokesman Euphranor, and Crito, who serves as a spokesman for traditional Christianity. The mostly-silent narrator of the dialogue is given the name Dion.

The work contains two especially notable sections:
* Dialogue IV, in which Berkeley presents a novel [[teleological argument]] for the existence of [[God]] based on Berkeley's theory of visual language, defended in the ''[[Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision]]'' (first published in 1709, and included with the first edition of ''Alciphron'').&lt;ref&gt;See David Kline, "Berkeley's Divine Language Argument" in Ernest Sosa, ed., ''Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley'' (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1987), repr. in David Berman, ed., ''Alciphron in Focus'' (London: Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Dialogue VII, in which Berkeley presents a novel theory of language which has been compared with the theory of language advocated by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations''.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Flew, "Was Berkeley a Precursor of Wittgenstein?" in W. B. Todd, ed. ''Hume and the Enlightenment: Essays Presented to Ernest Campbell Mossner'' (Edinburgh: The University Press, 1974), repr. in Berman, ed., ''Alciphron''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a later work, ''[[The Theory of Vision Vindicated and Explained]]'' (first published in 1733), Berkeley adduced the work of [[Alberto Radicati]] as evidence that the views advocated by the character Lysicles were not overly exaggerated (para. 5).

[[Francis Orpen Morris]] who wrote the text.

A census on 30 March 1851 found the Lydon family living at Bridge Street, Great Driffield and the following details were recorded:
*Head of household Patrick Lydon, born in [[Ireland]], married, aged 42, Chelsea Pensioner and Relieving Officer of Driffield Union.

[[Image:Animhorse.gif|right|thumb|200px|A horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from  [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos. The animation consists of 8 drawings, which are "looped", i.e. repeated over and over.]]
An '''animated cartoon''' is a [[film]] for the [[movie theater|cinema]], [[television]] or computer screen, which is made using sequential [[drawing]]s, as opposed to [[animation]] in general, which include films made using [[clay animation|clay]], [[puppet]]s, [[3D modeling]] and other means. Animated cartoons are still created for entertainment, commercial, educational{{sfn|Dalacostaa|2009|p=1}} and personal purposes.

==History==
{{main|History of animation}}

===Early years===
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=8}}

A 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]], [[Iran]], has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevisuallinguist.com/2006/02/burnt-city-animation-vl.html|title=The Visual Linguist: Burnt City animation VL|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=The Visual Linguist|last=Cohn|first=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045|title=Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran|publisher=''Animation Magazine''|date=March 12, 2008|last=Ball|first=Ryan|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].

===Silent era===
[[File:How Animated Cartoons Are Made (1919).webm|thumb|''How Animated Cartoons Are Made'' (1919)]]
The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the [[Théâtre Optique]] in December 1888.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=3–4}} On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=5–6}} In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

The first (photographed) animated projection was ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) by newspaper cartoonist [[J. Stuart Blackton]],{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=7–8}} one of the co-founders of the Vitagraph Company arrived.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}} In the film, a cartoonist's line drawings of two faces were 'animated' (or came to life) on a blackboard. The two faces smiled and winked, and the cigar-smoking man blew smoke in the lady's face; also, a circus clown led a small dog to jump through a hoop.

The first animated projection in the traditional sense (i.e., on [[film|motion picture film]]) was ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by the French director [[Émile Cohl]] in 1908.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=9}} This was followed by two more films, ''Le Cauchemar du fantoche'' [''The Puppet's Nightmare,'', now lost] and ''Un Drame chez les fantoches'' [''A Puppet Drama,'' called ''The Love Affair in Toyland'' for American release and ''Mystical Love-Making'' for British release], all completed in 1908.

One of the very first successful animated cartoons was ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) by [[Winsor McCay]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=16–17}} It is considered the first example of true [[character animation]]. At first, animated cartoons were [[black-and-white]] and silent. [[Felix the Cat]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] are notable examples.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=55, 59}}

==="Golden Age"===
{{main|Golden age of American animation}}
From the 1920s to 1960s, theatrical cartoons were produced in huge numbers, and usually shown before a feature film in a movie theater. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] (distributed by [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], then [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], then [[United Artists]], then [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], then independently), [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]], and [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]) were the largest studios producing these 5- to 10-minute "shorts." Other studios included [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] (distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]), [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] (distributed by [[United Artists]]), [[Van Beuren Studios]] (distributed by [[RKO Pictures]]), [[ComiColor Cartoons]] (distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Charles Mintz]] Studios (later [[Screen Gems]]) (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), [[Famous Studios]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), and [[Terrytoons]] (distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]).

The first cartoon to use a [[soundtrack]] was in 1926 with [[Max Fleischer]]'s ''[[My Old Kentucky Home (movie)|My Old Kentucky Home]].'' However the Fleischers used a [[Lee De Forest|De Forest]] sound system and the sound was not completely synchronized with the film.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=89}} [[Walt Disney]]'s 1928 cartoon ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' starring [[Mickey Mouse]] was the first to use a [[click track]] during the recording session, which produced better [[Synchronization|synchronism]]. "[[Mickey Mousing]]" became a term for any movie action (animated or [[live action]]) that was perfectly synchronized with music. The music used is original most of the time, but [[musical quotation]] is often employed. Animated characters usually performed the action in "loops," i.e., drawings were repeated over and over.

Although other producers had made films earlier using 2-strip color, Disney produced the first cartoon in 3-strip [[Technicolor]], ''[[Flowers and Trees]],'' in 1932. Technicians at the Fleischer studio invented [[rotoscoping]], in which animators trace live action in order to make animation look more realistic. However, rotoscoping made the animation look stiff and the technique was later used more for studying human and animal movement, rather than directly tracing and copying filmed movements.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=14}}
Later, other movie technologies were adapted for use in animation, such as [[multiplane camera]]s with ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937),{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=51}} [[stereophonic sound]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), widescreen processes with the feature-length ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and even [[3-D film|3D]] with ''[[Lumber Jack-Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=265}} 

Today, [[traditional animation]] uses traditional methods, but is aided by [[computer]]s in certain areas. This gives the [[animator]] new tools not available that could not be achieved using old techniques.

==Feature films==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
{{main|Lists of animated feature films}}

In 1917, Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] created the first animated feature ever made, ''[[El Apóstol]]'', utilizing cutout animation; however, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of the film, and it is now considered [[lost film|lost]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=49–51}}

In 1937, Disney created the first sound and color animated feature film, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=66–67}}

The name "animated cartoon" is generally not used when referring to full-length animated productions, since the term more or less implies a "short." Huge numbers of animated feature films were, and are still, produced.

==Television==
Competition from television drew audiences away from movie theaters in the late 1950s, and the theatrical cartoon began its decline. Today, animated cartoons for American audiences are produced mostly for television.

American television animation of the 1950s featured quite [[limited animation]] styles, highlighted by the work of [[Jay Ward]] on ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} [[Chuck Jones]] coined the term "illustrated radio" to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=231}} Other notable 1950s programs include [[United Productions of America|UPA]]'s ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=131–132}} [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Huckleberry Hound]]'' and ''[[Quick Draw McGraw]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} and rebroadcast of many classic theatrical cartoons from [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Walter Lantz]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]], and [[Disney]].

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon, ''[[The Flintstones]]'', was the first successful [[primetime]] animated series in the United States, running from 1960 to 1966 (and in [[reruns]] since).{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=235}} While many networks followed the show's success by scheduling other cartoons in the early 1960s, including ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', and ''[[The Alvin Show]]'', none of these programs survived more than a year (save Scooby-Doo, which, despite not being a primetime cartoon, has managed to stay afloat for over four decades). However, networks found success by running these shows as [[Saturday morning cartoons]], reaching smaller audiences with more demographic unity among children. Television animation for children flourished on Saturday morning, on cable channels like [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]]/[[Disney XD]] and [[Cartoon Network]], [[PBS Kids]], and in syndicated afternoon timeslots.

The scheduling constraints of the TV animation process, notably issues of resource management, led to the development of various techniques known now as [[limited animation]]. Full-frame animation ("on ones") became rare in its use outside of theatrical productions in the United States.

Primetime cartoons for mature audiences were virtually non-existent in the mainstream of the United States until the 1990s hit, when ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ushered in a new era of [[adult animation]]. Now, "adult animation" programs, such as, ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' have increased the number of animated sitcoms on prime-time and evening American television. In addition, animated works from other countries (notably Japan) have had varying levels of airplay in the United States since the 1960s.

===Commercial animation===
Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.

The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] "[[Kills Bugs Dead]]" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company. The concept has been used in many countries since.

'''Architectural painting''' (also '''Architecture painting''') is a form of [[Genre art|genre painting]] where the predominant focus lies on architecture, both outdoors views and interiors. While architecture was present in many of the earliest paintings and illuminations, it was mainly used as background or to provide rhythm to a painting. In the Renaissance, architecture was used to emphasize the perspective and create a sense of depth, like in [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' from the 1420s.

In Western art, architectural painting as an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=Sheila D.|title=Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135495749|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPhLoy0FICMC&amp;pg=PA21 |chapter=Architectural painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fredericksen|first1=Burton B.|title=Masterpieces of Painting in the J.

Closely related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially [[illusionistic ceiling painting]], and [[cityscape]]s.

==Western artists specialized in architectural painting==

===16th century===
[[File:Hans Vredeman de Vries - Architectural Landscape - WGA25387.jpg|thumb|''Architectural landscape'' by [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
The 16th century saw the development of architectural painting as a separate genre in Western art. The main centers in this period were Flanders and the Netherlands. The first important architectural painter was Dutch [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] (1527-1607), who was both an architect and a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waagen|first1=Gustav Friedrich|title=Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools.|date=1860|publisher=John Murray|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of Hans Vredeman de Vries, both in Flanders and in the Netherlands, include his sons Salomon and Paul, and [[Hendrik van Steenwijk I]]. Through them the genre was popularized and their family and students turned it into one of the main domains of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].

{{Norwegian-people}}
The '''architecture of Norway''' has evolved in response to changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.

Norway's architectural trends are also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the [[Viking Age]], wooden structures developed into a sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking [[longship]]s. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed [[arch]]es, [[barrel vault]]s, [[cruciform]] [[pier (architecture)|piers]] supporting [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and [[groin vault]]s; in large part as a result of religious influence from [[England]].

During the Middle Ages, the geography dictated a [[Economy of Norway|dispersed economy]] and [[Demographics of Norway|population]]. As a result, the traditional [[Norwegian farm culture]] remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting [[feudalism]]. This, combined with the ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the [[Baroque]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Rococo]] architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.

Instead, these factors resulted in distinctive traditions in Norwegian [[vernacular architecture]], which have been preserved in existing farms in the many Norwegian open-air museums that showcase buildings from the [[Middle Ages]] through to the 19th century; prominent examples include the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]] in [[Oslo]] and [[Maihaugen]] in [[Lillehammer]], as well as extant buildings still in service on farms such as those in the [[Heidal]] valley.

In the 20th century, Norwegian architecture has been characterized by its connection with Norwegian social policy on the one hand, and innovation on the other. Norwegian architects have been recognized for their work, both within Norway—where architecture has been considered an expression of social policy—and outside Norway, in several innovative projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.norway.org.uk/history/royalvisit/news2610/riba.htm |title=The Queen promotes Norwegian architecture at the Royal Institute of British Architects |accessdate=2008-03-14 |last= |first= |date= 2005-10-27 |work= |publisher= Royal Norwegian embassy in London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.norway-egypt.org/culture/architecture/alexandria/alexandria.htm |title=Library in Alexandria |accessdate=2008-03-14 |last= |first= |work= |publisher= Royal Norwegian embassy in Cairo |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222005240/http://www.norway-egypt.org/culture/architecture/alexandria/alexandria.htm |archivedate = December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==History==
Construction in Norway has always been characterized by the need to shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and to make the most of scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.

===Pre-historic times===
The earliest traces of human habitation in Norway are dated to about 9000 BC, in mountainous regions near [[Store Myrvatn]] in contemporary [[Rogaland]], where excavations have found portable dwellings most likely kept by nomadic reindeer hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.museum.no/fagomraader/Forsk-oppgaver06/SBA-1.htm |title=Sveinung Bang-Andersen: The main project: The Myrvatn/Fløyrlivatn Group: Early Mesolithic pioneers in the interior of southwest Norway |publisher=Museum of Archeology in Stavanger |author=Sveinung Bang-Andersen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221213553/http://www.ark.museum.no/fagomraader/Forsk-oppgaver06/SBA-1.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of such tents have also been found other places along the western coast; at Fosenstraumen near [[Radøy]] in [[Hordaland]] archeological evidence indicates that tents in use at about 6500 BC were of similar design to those still in use by the [[Sami people|Sami]] nomads&lt;ref name="arkhistorie"&gt;Brekke, Nordhagen, and Lexau: Norsk arkitekturhistorie. Frå steinalder og bronsealder til det 21. århundret. {{ISBN|82-521-5748-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, such tents became semi-permanent through the introduction of a simple foundation. Traces of these can be found at the [[Vega, Norway|Vega]] archipelago, an area that is now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.verdensarvvega.no/english.htm |title= Vega Islands as World Heritage|accessdate= 2008-03-14 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= Vega Archipelago Foundation |pages= |doi= |archivedate= 2007-11-28|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20071128154025/http://www.verdensarvvega.no/english.htm|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first permanent dwellings were probably built between 3000 and 2000 BC, with the introduction of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. [[Iron Age]] dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in [[long house]]s in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures from the [[Stone Age]] through the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] and the Iron Age have been excavated at [[Forsand]] in [[Ryfylke]], near [[Stavanger]] and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortidslandsbyen.no/ |title=Fortidslandsbyen Landa |accessdate=2008-03-14 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |doi= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403192141/http://www.fortidslandsbyen.no/ |archivedate=3 April 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viking and medieval eras===
Two distinctive timber building traditions found their confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was the practice of [[log cabin|log building]] with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique thought to have been imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the [[stave building]] tradition (typically found in [[stave church]]es), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the [[Oseberg ship]]) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the [[Lofoten]] archipelago in [[Northern Norway]], a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]].&lt;ref name="Seip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/history/032005-990451/index-dok000-b-n-a.html|title=Elisabeth Seip: Architecture in Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/oseberg/indexE.html |title=Oseberg find site |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615063416/http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/oseberg/indexE.html |archivedate=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofotr.no/engelsk/index.htm|title=Lofotr museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not counting the 28 remaining stave churches, at least 250 wooden houses predating the [[Black Death]] in 1350 are preserved more or less intact in Norway. Most of these are log houses, some with added stave-built galleries or porches.&lt;ref name="Seip"/&gt;

As the political power in Norway was consolidated and had to contend with external threats, larger structures were built in accordance with military technology at the time. Fortresses, bridges, and ultimately churches and manors were built with stone and masonry. These structures followed the European styles of their time.

====Stave churches====
{{Main|Stave church}}
[[File:Stave church Urnes, exterior view 1.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Urnes stave church]] in [[Luster, Norway]], listed as a [[world Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]]]
Possibly more than 1000 stave churches were built in Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the beginning of the 19th century, as many as 150 stave churches still existed. Many were destroyed as part of a religious movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and today only 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished.

The stave churches owe their longevity to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most important was the introduction of massive ''sills'' underneath the ''staves'' (posts) to prevent them from rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.

====Romanesque architecture====
[[File:Bergen mariakirken2 edit.jpg|alt=Stone  Romanesque church with two  towers and a  lower, pitched roof entrance hall between them. The towers have slightly curved  bronze roofs.| thumb|upright|left|[[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] in Bergen, an example of Romanesque architecture in Norway.]]
The first stone churches in Norway were Romanesque, built under the influence of [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]aries, particularly bishop [[Pope Adrian IV|Nicholas Breakspear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katolsk.no/www/about_en.htm|title=Catholic Church of Norway: The History of the Catholic Church in Norway|publisher=Catholic Church of Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later churches were influenced by Continental architecture. Examples include the churches at [[Ringsaker]], [[Kviteseid]], and elsewhere. Many of these churches have either been lost or rebuilt in the Gothic style, but numerous examples still exist, notably the Trondenes Churchat Trondenesin [[Troms]].

====Gothic architecture====
Several churches that were originally built as Romanesque structures were modified or extended during the Gothic period. Among these are the cathedral of [[Hamar]], now in ruins, the [[Stavanger Cathedral]], and the renowned [[Nidaros Cathedral]], one of the most important pilgrim destinations in medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidarosdomen.no/english/nidaroscathedral/ |title=About the Nidaros Cathedral |publisher=Nidaros Cathedral |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707214217/http://www.nidarosdomen.no/english/nidaroscathedral/ |archivedate=2006-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NidarosdomenPanorama.jpg|alt=A Romanesque church with Gothic pointed arches. Two rectangular towers separated by a pitched roof entrance hall.

===Under Danish rule===
{{See also|Denmark-Norway}}
In the late Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was severely weakened. In 1389 Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the [[Kalmar Union]]. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in [[Copenhagen]] regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/history/upto1814/unionden/unionden.htm|title=Norway in the United States|author=|date=|website=Norgesportalen|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious [[Renaissance architecture]] is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.

Fortresses, such as [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]] in [[Oslo]], [[Vardøhus Fortress|Vardøhus]] in [[Vardø]], [[Tønsberg Fortress|Tønsberghus]] in [[Tønsberg]], the [[Kongsgården]] in [[Trondheim]] and [[Bergenhus Fortress|Bergenhus]] with the [[Bergenhus Fortress|Rosenkrantz Tower]] in [[Bergen]] were built in stone in accordance with standards for defensive fortifications of their time. Many of these were modernized and rebuilt through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr3_2005/11.html |title=Rosenkrantztårnet: To tårn for prisen av ett |author=Morten Ryen |work=Åpent rom |year=2005 |publisher=[[Statsbygg]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714093018/http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr3_2005/11.html |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Guthorm Kavli]]: Norges festninger : fra Fredriksten til Vardøhus, 1987.

The [[Hanseatic League]] also built unique commercial buildings at [[Bryggen]] in Bergen, starting in the 16th century. They were log buildings combining native and [[Architecture of Germany|German]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturskolesekken.no/institusjonsside.asp?ID=41|title=Overview of Schøtstuene on the Hansa wharf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019105215/http://www.kulturskolesekken.no/institusjonsside.asp?ID=41|archivedate=2006-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renaissance architecture====
After the [[Black Death]], monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill, except for vernacular building, only to be resumed in the 16th and 17th centuries under Danish administration.&lt;ref name=Seip/&gt; There are few examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Norway, the most prominent being the [[Bergenhus Fortress|Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in [[Hardanger]], and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austråt]] manor near [[Trondheim]], and parts of Akershus Fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Kristel Christensen: ''Baroniet Rosendal'' major thesis at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Håkon A. Andersen: ''Austrått'', 1996 {{ISBN|82-90502-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] undertook a number of projects in Norway that were largely based on [[Renaissance architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Joakim A. Skovgaard: A king's architecture : Christian IV and his buildings, London, 1973 {{ISBN|0-238-78979-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He established mining operations in [[Kongsberg]] and [[Røros]], now a [[World Heritage Site]]. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was moved to a new location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed [[Oslo|Christiania]]. King Christian also founded the trading city of [[Kristiansand]], naming it after himself.

====Baroque architecture====
[[Image:Fredriksten fortress Norway seen from Halden harbor.jpg|alt=Modest buildings  along the water's edge are guarded by a fortress on the hill above.|left|thumb|[[Halden|Fredrikshald]] / [[Fredriksten]], a border town built to protect the Dano-Norwegian realm]]
As Norway became a strategic part of the Danish-Norwegian kingdom, Danish kings built fortifications along borders and the seacoast. Over time, many of the fortifications at border areas and ports were modernized in line with Baroque military practice.

Although most residences were built according to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of [[Baroque architecture]]. Only the city of Christiania ([[Oslo]]) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, and a number of large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros&lt;ref&gt;Sverre Ødegaard: Bergstaden Røros, 1997 {{ISBN|82-91399-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kongsberg.&lt;ref&gt;Gunvor Thingstad Bøen, Hølje Bøen: Kongsberg kirke : bergstadens juvel, 2003, {{ISBN|82-91399-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous Baroque structure in Norway is [[Stiftsgården]], the Royal residence in [[Trondheim]], a residential building that is one of the largest wooden structure in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr1_2002/artikler/trondheim1.html |title=Statsbygg article on Stiftsgården |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714100532/http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr1_2002/artikler/trondheim1.html |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rococo architecture====
[[File:Damsgaardhovedgaard.jpg|alt= Ornate, symmetrical, wooden house with two smaller wings with decorative engaged columns. The pitched roof has gables. The windows are paned and the front door has columns on either side.|thumb|[[Damsgård Manor]] in Bergen, example of Norwegian rococo architecture]]
[[Rococo]] provided a brief but significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, ''[[rosemaling]]'', and related [[wood carving]] style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, [[Damsgård Manor]] in Bergen being the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bymuseet.no/?vis=82|title=Bergen City Museum site on Damsgård}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In towns and central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were increasingly covered by weatherboards, a fashion made possible by [[sawmill]] technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But the main reason for the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.

===19th century===
The [[Napoleonic Wars]] led to the separation of Norway and Denmark. Norway was restored in 1814 as an autonomous kingdom in a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]]. The two states had separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service. Regained statehood required new public buildings, mainly in the capital of Christiania. During the following century, the country experienced an impressive growth in wealth and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings.

====Neo-classicism====
[[File:Det kongelige slott 2 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace at Oslo, an example of neo-Classical architecture in Norway]]
At the dawn of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them military officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structures were much in demand.

Architect [[Carl Frederik Stanley]] (1769–1805), educated in [[Copenhagen]], spent some years in Norway around the turn of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major achievement was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the [[Oslo Cathedral School|Oslo Katedralskole]], completed in 1800. He added a classical [[portico]] to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]] as a national monument.

[[Christian Collett]] (1771–1833), a graduate of the Mining Academy at [[Kongsberg]], designed the splendid [[Ulefoss]] manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner [[Niels Aall]]. This is one of the few brick houses in Norway, boasting a [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] layout, a central [[cupola]], and a classical [[colonnade]]. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.

The same period saw the erection of a large number of splendid neo-classisist houses in and around all towns along the coast, notably in [[Halden]], [[Oslo]], [[Drammen]], [[Arendal]], [[Bergen]] and [[Trondheim]], mainly wooden buildings dressed up as stone architecture. By far the largest private house in Norway is the [[Jarlsberg manor]], renovated 1812-1814 by the Danish architect Løser for count [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]].

Christiania, promoted to the status of a capital city in 1814, had practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of a strained economy. The first major undertaking was the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]], designed by [[Hans Linstow]] and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned [[Karl Johans gate]], the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for the University, the Parliament (''[[Parliament of Norway|Storting]]'') and other institutions. But only the University buildings were realised according to this plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d147382.htm Det nye Slottet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719045637/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d147382.htm |date=2012-07-19 }} by [[Thomas Thiis-Evensen]], in [[Aftenposten]], June 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Heinrich Grosch]], one of the first fully educated architects in Norway, designed the original building for the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] (1826–1828), the local branch of [[Norges Bank|the Bank of Norway]] (1828), [[Christiania Theatre]] (1836–1837), and the first campus for the [[University of Oslo]] (1841–1856).&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Seip (ed.) ; Jens Christian Eldal, [[Anne-Lise Seip]], Åse Moe Torvanger: ''Chr. H. Grosch : arkitekten som ga form til det nye Norge'' {{ISBN|82-92238-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the University buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].&lt;ref name="Aslaksby"&gt;Aslaksby, Truls and Ulf Hamran: ''Arkitektene Christian Heinrich Grosch og Karl Friedrich Schinkel og byggingen av Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet i Christiania'' 1986, {{ISBN|82-90359-32-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German architectural influence persisted in Norway, and many wooden buildings followed the principles of Neoclassicism.

====Romanticism and historicism====
[[File:Trefoldighetskirken.JPG|alt=Large, fanciful building with towers, pointed arches, and a large dome in the center, topped by a spire.|thumb|left|[[Trefoldighetskirken (Oslo)|Trefoldighetskirken]] in Oslo]]
[[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] also had an influence on Norwegian architecture from around 1840. Following the German lead, many classicist architects designed red-brick buildings in a revival of medieval styles. Romanesque and Gothic examples were considered eminently suitable for churches, public institutions and factories. Linstow was the first Norwegian architect to be inspired by the Middle Ages in his proposal of 1837 for a square to be surrounded by public building, bisected by an avenue between Christiania and the new Royal Palace. On the north side, planned buildings for the University were to be "composed in some Medieval or Florentine style", with exposed brick-work.&lt;ref name="Aslaksby"/&gt; His classicist colleague Grosch was the first to convert to historicism and realize a number of red-brick buildings, after his 1838 visit to [[Berlin]], where he met the famous architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The first major historicist work by Grosch was the neo-romanesque ''Bazaars'' and the adjacent firestation near the [[Oslo Cathedral]], begun in 1840 and extended in several stages until 1859. Other architects followed, notably [[Heinrich Ernst Schirmer]] with the ''Botsfengselet'' (penitentiary) (1844–1851), the [[Gaustad Hospital]] (1844–1855) and the [[Train station|Railway Station]] (1854) (with ''von Hanno''). Also in Oslo, the German architect [[Alexis de Chateauneuf]] (1799-1853) designed [[Trinity Church (Oslo)|Trefoldighetskirken]], the first neo-gothic church, completed by ''von Hanno'' in 1858.

Most urban apartment buildings and villas continued to be built in the classical tradition, with plastered brick walls. The repertoire of historic styles was expanded in [[Homansbyen]], Oslo's first residential development of detached villas, planned by [[Georg Andreas Bull]]. He designed most of the early villas built from 1858 until 1862 in a variety of styles, ranging from medieval to classicist and exotic.

[[File:Dalen Hotel-2011.jpg|alt=Large half-timbered building with sprawling wings, and an oriental-looking structure on the roof.|thumb|[[Dalen Hotel]], a good example of the so-called "dragon style"]]
From around 1840, architects started to design wooden buildings in a new style, the so-called [[Swiss chalet style]]&lt;!--(''sveitserstil'')--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Eldal&gt;Jens Christian Eldal: ''Historisme i tre: "sveitserstil", byggeskikks-romantikk og nasjonal egenart i europeisk og norsk trearkitektur på 1800-tallet'' 1998. Scandinavian University Press. {{ISBN|82-00-12982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed ''historicism in wood'', a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.

The Swiss chalet style evolved into a Scandinavian variation, known in Norway as the "[[Dragestil|dragon style]]”, which combined motifs from Viking and medieval art with vernacular elements from the more recent past. The most renowned practitioner of this style was the architect [[Holm Hansen Munthe]], who designed a number of tourist resorts, exhibition pavilions and churches in the 1880s and 1890s. These caught the eye of the German emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who visited Norway annually. He commissioned Munthe to design his "Matrosenstation" near [[Potsdam]] and a hunting lodge with at "stave church" in [[Krasnolesye|Rominten]] in [[East Prussia]]. These last buildings were destroyed during World War II.

Architects abandoned both the "Swiss" and the "dragon" styles shortly after 1900, but elements of the "Swiss style" survived in vernacular buildings for some decades. In the recent past, producers of pre-fabricated family homes have increasingly reintroduced motifs from the "Swiss" style in their repertoire.

===Vernacular Architecture===
{{Main|Vernacular architecture in Norway}}

[[Image:Tronderlaane in Oppdal Norway.jpg|thumb|Trønderlåne - example of vernacular architecture typically found in Trøndelag]]
Until the 20th century, most Norwegians lived and worked in buildings that were designed and built according to [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] building traditions, what in Norwegian is known as ''byggeskikk''. These practices varied somewhat by region and climatic conditions and evolved over time, but were largely based on use of wood and other locally available resources.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Anker: Norsk folkekunst : kunsthåndverk og byggeskikk i det gamle bondesamfunnet . 2004. Oslo. Cappelen. {{ISBN|82-02-23839-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Middle Ages, most dwellings were log houses with notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure protection against the elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or ''gårdstun''. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.

Building practices along the coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (''våningshus''), hay barn (''låve''), livestock barn (''fjøs''), one or more food storage houses (''stabbur''), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (''eldhus'') and [[Forge|smithies]] were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.

In [[Eastern Norway|Eastern inland Norway]] and [[Trøndelag]], the houses around a tun were typically organized in a square (''firkanttun''); in [[Gudbrandsdal]], there was a distinction between ''inntun'' (inner tun) and ''uttun'' (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.

Depending upon the size and economic well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (''oppstue''), a house for the retired farmers (''føderådstue''), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (''vognskjul''), and even distillery (''brenneskur''). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities they could not afford to build houses for.

Building traditions varied by region and type of structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it difficult for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with [[birch]] bark and [[sod]].

Many places in Norway farms also maintained mountain farms (''[[Transhumance|seter]]/støl''), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture during the summer months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.

Modern Norwegian farms often maintain many building traditions but no longer need the many and varied buildings of the past. However, many of the traditions have been carried on in more recently built vacation cabins in the mountains and along the coast.

===20th-century architecture===
The German influence brought into Norway by [[Nordic Classicism|neo-classicism]] abated when Norway [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|gained full independence]] in 1905. A new generation of Norwegian architects educated in Sweden took the lead in developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in [[Trondheim]], there also emerged a distinctly [[List of Norwegian architects|Norwegian collegium of architects]] that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian [[Sigfried Giedeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meamnet.polimi.it/archive/037/037&amp;nbsp;m1.html|title=MEAM Net article on Christian Norberg-Schulz}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art nouveau architecture====
[[File:Jugendstilsenteret.jpg|alt=Ornate stone three-storied building encompassing a street corner, with a windowed turret and topped by a spiral.|thumb|right|upright|Jugendstilsenteret - The Jugendstil Centre in Ålesund]]
The ''[[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]]'', a variant of [[Art Nouveau]], had a certain influence on much of the new construction in Norway around the turn of the 20th century. The city of [[Ålesund]], after [[Ålesund Fire|burning]] to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with [[Riga]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Harald Grytten et al.: ''Fugl Føniks: Ålesund opp av asken'' 2004. {{ISBN|82-91024-08-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trondheim]] also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the [[Historisk Museum|Historical Museum]] and the [[Regjeringsbygningen|Government office building]]. In Bergen, the main theatre [[Den Nationale Scene]] is a monumental example.

====Mass residential architecture====
Changing demographics and a growing social awareness led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, sanitary, and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population in general and the working class in particular. This was known as ''boligsaken'' ("the housing cause") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.&lt;ref name=nasjonsbygging&gt;Ulf Grønvold: Hundre års nasjonsbygging: arkitektur og samfunn 1905 - 2005. Pax forlag. 2005. {{ISBN|82-530-2758-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not unlike other countries during the evolution of their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class families had no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen and one or two rooms.

Before World War II, a number of cooperative investment projects known as "egne hjem" (roughly "our own homes") resulted in a handful of developments, but after the war these gave way to cooperative organizations that were formed to finance and build large-scale residential complexes. The largest-- [[Oslo Bolig og Sparelag]], known as ''OBOS''—built its first complex [[Etterstad]] in Oslo, but there were similar initiatives throughout the country. These co-ops set standards for housing, hired architects to design solutions, and contracted to have them built. Entire sections, known as ''drabantbyer'' - or "satellite cities" - were built in the outskirts of major cities. The first of these - [[Lambertseter]] - introduced an entirely new phenomenon in the eastern areas of Oslo such as in [[Grorud Valley|Groruddalen]], but similar areas also emerged in Bergen, Trondheim, and other cities. The apex of this trend was reached in 1966 with the massive buildings in [[Ammerudlia]].&lt;ref name=OBOS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obos.no/default.aspx?did=283241|title=OBOS: Historikk og arkitektur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This era—which had spent most of its force by the mid-1970s—led to an increased awareness of the physical and emotional needs of city dwellers. Some of the issues under debate were.&lt;ref name=nasjonsbygging/&gt;
* '''Kitchen''' - traditional Norwegian homes combined the family room and kitchen, but in early apartment buildings, small, so-called "laboratory kitchens" were popular. Over time, eat-in-kitchens took their place.
* '''Natural light'''--large apartment buildings were oriented to provide sunlight to the residents, ideally orienting the kitchen toward the east to get the morning light and the living room to the west for evening light.
* '''Privacy'''--providing separate sleeping quarters for parents and children, and among children led to larger apartments over time. Similarly, most buildings had a limited number of apartments adjoining each staircase.
* '''Alienation''' - monolithic, homogenous apartment complexes reinforced what some{{Who|date=July 2010}} characterized as "social democracy's hell."

The perceived shortcomings of the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the [[Parliament of Norway]] recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The [[Norwegian State Housing Bank]] (''Husbanken'') provided citizens with the ability to fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.

As a result of the pioneering efforts by [[Olav Selvaag]] and others, archaic and otherwise unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes.

====Functionalism====
[[File:GriegLouEide02.JPG|alt=A small, flat-roofed, stucco house designed with simple, rectangular shapes, and built into a hillside. The casement, paned, and plate glass windows are wood framed.|thumb|Villa Eide in Bergen, example of "funkis" architecture]]

In the late 1920s, [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] (or the [[International style (architecture)|International style]]) was taken up by Scandinavian architects. In Scandinavia this architectural trend was called [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (or colloquially in Sweden and Norway "funkis"). Modernism found many adherents among young architects, especially in Norway. Its definite breakthrough was the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]] in 1930, after which the majority of architects all over Scandinavia converted to the modern movement. Nowhere else did Modernism become so firmly established as the mainstream trend in architecture. It maintained its dominant position until about 1940.

A number of landmark structures, particularly in Oslo, were built in the functionalist style, the first one being the ''Skansen'' restaurant (1925–1927) by [[Lars Backer]], demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at ''Ekeberg'', opened in 1929. The art gallery [[Kunstnernes Hus]] by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]] (1930) still shows influence from the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s. [[Hvalstrand]] bath (1934)&lt;ref&gt;Bernt Bucher-Johannessen, Eira Kjernlie and Peter Lawrance: ''Hvalstrand bad : maten, arkitekturen, historien''. Schibsted, {{ISBN|82-516-1965-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of several public seaside bath facilities in Norway, by [[André Peters]]. A year before, [[Ingierstrand Bad]] was designed by [[Ole Lind Schistad]] (1891-1979) and [[Eivind Moestue]](1893 -1977). Other great names of Norwegian functionalist architecture are [[Ove Bang]], [[Fridtjof Reppen]], [[Nicolai Beer]] (1885-1950) and [[Per Grieg]] (1897-1962).

====Reconstruction architecture====
Following the [[scorched earth]] tactics of retreating [[Wehrmacht]] troops, large areas in [[Northern Norway]] needed to be rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Ingebjørg Hage: ''Som fugl føniks av asken? : gjenreisingshus i Nord-Troms og Finnmark''.

The [[Museum of Reconstruction]] in [[Hammerfest]] is dedicated to the reconstruction.

====Government-sponsored architecture====
[[File:Oslo Nationaltheatret.JPG|alt=Building with stone columns at the base, and marble columns on the top portion.|thumb|left|National Theatre in Oslo.]]
As Norway gained full independence in 1905, the national government determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.

In the early years, such public works were limited to structures needed for the national government's own administrative needs, but an increasing number of large-scale projects were conceived, designed, and completed since 1905 to meet various needs, such as:
* '''Public health and welfare''', including:
** ''Hospital complexes and polyclinical facilities'', e.g., [[Rikshospitalet]], [[Haukeland University Hospital]], [[Gaustad Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;John Arne Balto, (ed.): ''Norsk sykehusarkitektur'', special edition of annual journal of [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments|Fortidsminneforeningen]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
** ''Orphanages'', later vacated in favor of other solutions that in turn required their own architecture.
** ''[[Sanatorium|Sanatoria]]'', also vacated as the public health problem of [[tuberculosis]] was solved&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Skogheim]]: ''Frisk luft og diett: norske tuberkulosesanatorier'', article in annual journal for [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments|Fortidsminneforeningen]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Temporary and provisional housing'' for the indigent, asylum seekers, and homeless.
* '''Sports and recreation facilities'''. Social policy in Norway both at the national and local level has emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers have typically been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training. As an example, the [[Holmenkollen ski jump]] has been rebuilt several times, the [[Bislett Stadion]] was rebuilt in 2004-2005, and virtually every [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] has built year-round facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Johan-Ditlef Martens: ''Idrettsanlegg og estetikk'', 2001. Oslo. {{ISBN|82-05-28524-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Centers for cultural expression'''. Some of the most ambitious and controversial structures have been those dedicated to performing arts, art museums, and any combination of such activities. Since many of these have been built in cities with an architectural legacy, their designs have sought—more or less successfully—to complement the urban landscape by giving it a modern element. Examples include the [[Henie-Onstad Art Centre]] (by [[Jon Eikvar]] and [[Sven Erik Engebretsen]]), [[Chateau Neuf]] by Lund &amp; Slaatto, the "barn" at [[Hedmark museum|Hedmarkmuseet]] by [[Sverre Fehn]], and the [[Grieg Hall]] (by [[Knud Munk]]).
* '''Churches'''. The Norwegian State Church, holding the legacy of nearly one thousand years of Norwegian church architecture, commissioned new churches that covered a wide range of architectural styles, including entirely new designs (e.g. the [[Arctic Cathedral]] by [[Jan Inge Hovig]]) to new casts of traditional designs (e.g., [[Veldre church]], by [[Roar Jacobsen]] and [[Ulf Zettersten]].)&lt;ref&gt;Arne E. Sæther: ''Kirken som bygg og bilde : rom og liturgi ved et tusenårsskifte : en bok om kirkebygging før, nå og i fremtiden''. Asker, 2001 {{ISBN|82-992135-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reidun Mellem: ''Tromsdalskjerka fyller førti''. 2005. {{ISBN|82-992267-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transportation infrastructure''', including bridges, tunnels, and most notably transit centers for rail, sea, and air transportation. [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo airport]] (by the [[Aviaplan]] consortium at Gardermoen) was Norway's largest construction project ever.&lt;ref&gt;Trond Bergh, Helge Ryggvik, Jon Gulowsen: ''Jernbanen i Norge 1854-2004'', 2004. {{ISBN|82-419-0333-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Elnan: ''Luftslottet: materiell og arkitektur ved Oslo Lufthavn - Gardermoen'', major thesis in sociology at the [[University of Oslo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural designs of these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found the opportunity to develop their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.

Many of the projects have been controversial, and the resulting creative tension has probably served to advance the state of architectural arts in Norway. National and local governments and governmental institutions will continue to be among the largest customers of architects in coming years.

==Contemporary themes==
[[File:Molde im Februar 2005.jpg|alt=Multi-storied glass building in the shape of a gaff-rigged sail.|thumb|left|[[Rica Seilet Hotel]] in [[Molde]]]]
A number of trends influence contemporary architecture in Norway, among them:&lt;ref name=arkhistorie/&gt;
* '''Growing public and private affluence'''. Buildings have a wider range of purpose, and are expected to meet increasingly complex demands. For example, the [[Oslo Opera House|new opera building]] (designed by [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]]) in Oslo reflects an ambition not just to build a vibrant cultural center, but also to create a new architectural icon in the [[Oslofjord]].
* '''Aesthetics as a factor of well-being'''. From the early austere principle that form should strictly follow function, there is a growing sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.
* '''Environmental concerns'''. In addition to concerns about air and water pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the [[natural landscape]]. More recently, architects have also worked with engineers to make the most out of scarce resources, e.g., energy, water, etc.
* '''Demographic diversity'''. [[Demographics of Norway|Norwegian demographics]] have undergone significant changes the last few decades, resulting in new religious buildings
* '''Norwegian building traditions'''. While it may be too much to speak of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of [[Oppdal]] and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of [[Grünerløkka]].

A number of architectural prizes are awarded in Norway, including ''Houens fonds diplom'', ''Treprisen'', ''Statens byggeskikkpris'', ''Sundts premie'', ''Betongelementprisen'', ''[[Betongtavlen]]'', ''Glassprisen'', ''Murverksprisen'', ''Stenprisen'', and ''Stålkonstruksjonsprisen''.

The '''Association of Moving Image Archivists''' ('''AMIA''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[Nonprofit#USA|not-for-profit]] organization established to advance the field of [[Film preservation|moving image archiving]] by fostering cooperation among individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, description, preservation, exhibition and use of moving image materials.

==History==
[[File:AMPAS PickfordCenter.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]'s [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], 1313 N. [[Vine Street|Vine St.]], [[Hollywood]] - Home to the AMIA Office]]

Since the late 1960s, representatives from moving image archives have recognized the value of regular meetings to exchange practical information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the emergence of formal representation for the audiovisual preservation sector in the United States, see Anthony Slide, ''Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States'', Jefferson, NC, McFarland (1992), pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, this group of archivists originally known as the Film and Television Archives Advisory Committee (F/TAAC) expanded from a handful of participants to several hundred archivists from over 100 national, regional and local institutions. In 1990, the name of the group was changed to the Association of Moving Image Archivists. In 1991, AMIA voted to formalize as an individual-based member-based [[professional association]], the only one of its kind in the moving image archival field. Although AMIA's office is based in the US, its membership is now drawn from across the world.  Further information on the origins and history of AMIA can be found [http://www.amianet.org/about/mission here].&lt;ref&gt;See also Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck, ''Our Movie Heritage'', New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press (1997), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership is open to anyone who has an interest in the [[film preservation|preservation of moving images]] and associated sound recordings: in practice, most of the membership are professional [[archivist]]s (both [[public sector]] and [[Business|commercial]]) and people working in associated professions, e.g. [[librarian]]ship, the [[Film industry|film]] and [[television]] industry or [[Academia|academics]] in related fields.  AMIA offers both individual and institutional membership.

==Governing structure==
AMIA is governed by a [[Board of Directors]], which is elected by the membership on a two-year cycle, and chaired by a [[President#Non-governmental presidents|president]].  The Board oversees and ratifies the work of the sub-groups through which the work of the organization is undertaken.  The last significant changes to the governing structure were undertaken in 2009, when the present structure of committees and task forces was introduced.

===Current President===
* 2016-2017: Andrea Kalas

===Former Presidents===
* 2012-2015: Caroline Frick

===Committees and Task Forces===

AMIA is a volunteer based organization and projects rely on work done by its members in Committees and Task Forces.  More information about AMIA's Committees [http://www.amianet.org/community/committees can be found here].

* '''[[Committee]]s of the Board''' carry out the core management and policymaking functions of AMIA, e.g. running elections and organizing the conference.  Chairs are appointed directly by the Board of Directors, and although their members are volunteers drawn from within the wider AMIA membership, the rosters of Committees of the Board have to be approved by the Board.
* '''Committees of the Membership''' are the bodies through which AMIA's professional presence in the field exists.  They develop expertise, advocacy and education in the different topics and activities related to moving image archiving, e.g. preservation, copyright and cataloguing.  Their rosters are volunteers from within the AMIA membership, and they elect their chairs directly.
* '''[[task force|Task Forces]]''' are created by the Board of Directors to carry out a specific projects which does not fall squarely within the remit of an existing committee, and are dissolved on completion of that task.

==Activities==
[[File:AMIA conference 2006 audience.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates at the 2006 AMIA annual conference, held in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]]]

===Annual Conference===
One of the principal activities undertaken by AMIA is the [http://www.amiaconference.com/ annual conference], which takes place each fall at a different [[city]] in [[North America]].  Recent conferences have occurred in [[Austin, Texas]], [[Seattle, Washington]], [[Richmond, Virginia]], [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Portland, Oregon]].

Since 2008, The Reel Thing: Los Angeles has offered two days of presentations and screenings each August.  In addition, a half day event is held in conjunction with the AMIA Annual Conference.  For more information:  http://www.the-reel-thing.org/

===Digital Asset Symposium (DAS)===
DAS offers in-depth, real world information on an ever-advancing technology. Case studies offer a broad mix of institutions, providing a unique opportunity to compare approaches in different communities. This real-life approach brings together content creators, caretakers and vendors to address the realities with which we are all faced, what works in ''theory'', and what works in the real world.
http://www.digitalassetsymposium.com

===AMIA Online===
AMIA's online continuing education series are intended to further education in the archival moving image profession, as well as to provide introduction to these topics to the broader libraries and archives community.  http://www.amiaonline.org

===Festival of the Archives===
AMIA's Festival of the Archives celebrates the work done by media archives in their efforts to preserve history and cultural heritage.  The festival offers attendees quality films that highlight preservation and restoration efforts a wide spectrum of archival materials - feature films, documentaries, animation, historical footage, and commercial video.  The inaugural festival was held in December, 2012 in conjunction with the SIFF Cinema Uptown in Seattle, Washington.

===E-mail Discussion List and Online Forum===
AMIA operates an [http://www.amianet.org/community/list-serv E-mail discussion list], known as AMIA-L to facilitate professional communication within the field.  Subscription is open to AMIA members and non-members, and is free of charge.  Topics that frequently arise in online discussion include [[News media|news stories]] and media coverage related to moving image archiving, technical issues, requests for information about specific films or [[Footage|archive footage]] for re-use in TV productions, [[copyright]] and media history in general.  The AMIA-L generates approximately 10-15 postings a day.  All AMIA-L postings are archived online and [https://web.archive.org/web/20011005082629/http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/amia-l.html available for public access].  AMIA also operates a member list-serv to which only its members may subscribe.

===DEEP FOCUS: A Directory to Moving Image Resources===
Developed by AMIA's Access Committee, the DEEP FOCUS portal is an inclusive outreach tool designed to provide academics, archivists, artists, curators, educators, exhibitors, filmmakers, programmers, researchers and students with a user-friendly and centralized means of global discovery – interconnecting a disparate labyrinth of invaluable moving image catalogs, services, resources, websites and related information.

DEEP FOCUS welcomes a diverse range of entries into the directory. If your institution or company collects or works with moving images and/or provides services related to the field, your entry is integral to the success of the portal. You can find [http://www.amianet.org/resources-and-publications/deep-focus-moving-image-resources DEEP FOCUS here]

===Publications===
The AMIA [[Newsletter]] is published electronically four times per year. It provides up-to-date information about the association and its activities, as well as regular columns and features and resources of interest to moving image archivists.

''The Moving Image'' is a peer-reviewed [[academic journal]]  that explores topics relevant to both the media archivist and the media scholar. The Moving Image deals with crucial issues surrounding the preservation, archiving, and restoration of film, video, and digital moving images.  It is edited by Susan Ohmer and Don Crafton and published by [[University of Minnesota Press]].

''The AMIA Global Supplier Directory'',  is published electronically four times per year and available on the AMIA website.  The Supplier Directory is intended as an international resource guide for anyone working with audiovisual media.

===Scholarship and Internship Programs===
The training of moving image archivists is central to AMIA's role as a professional organization and essential to the long-term survival of our moving image heritage.  To this end, in addition to workshops and symposia, AMIA offers annual scholarships for students in education and training programs geared to the profession.  In addition, AMIA offers the [[Image Permanence Institute]] Internship in Preservation Research, offering a student of merit who is committed to the preservation of moving images the opportunity to acquire practical experience in preservation research.

===Professional Programs===
AMIA supports a number of public and professional programs to promote education and foster cooperation and communication among the individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, preservation, description, exhibition, and use of moving image materials.

As an international organization, AMIA offers two programs to encourage professional exchange and enhance professional development to professional archivists from the [[Developing country|developing world]].  More information can be found here:  http://www.amianet.org/programs-and-initiatives/list-of-programs

The Your Archive Deserves Advocacy! initiative offers three annual awards in an effort focused on promoting the people and stories behind archives as well as providing resources that support advocacy.

Community Travel Grants were established to pay tribute to the work of AMIA members, and offer colleagues, friends and families a way to honor contributions to the moving image field. The Fund provides travel funding for the AMIA Annual Conference.

AMIA provides [[workshop]]s covering a range of archival activities.  Workshops are offered primarily in conjunction with the annual conference, but AMIA also offers regional hands-on workshops when possible.  Recent workshops have covered:  digital programming basics; [[library catalog|cataloging]] &amp; [[metadata]]; safeguarding audio visual assets; archival film presentation for [[projectionist]]s, a writers workshop, access copy production for archivists, copyright, and an annual Hackday! and Community Archiving Workshop.

===Screenings and Events===
In addition to the three key events listed, AMIA organizes a number of special screenings and workshops that celebrate the preservation and restoration work done by archivists worldwide.

==Outreach==
As an NGO ([[non-governmental organization]]) AMIA has consultative status with [[UNESCO]] and has coordinated on international events and presented at UNESCO events - most recently at the [[Memory of the World Programme]] Conference in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Frick presentation at 2012 Memory of the World Conference"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frick|first=Caroline|title=AMIA Presentation at 2012 Memory of the World Conference|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/VC_Frick_28_B_1050.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, AMIA is affiliated with, and undertakes joint activities with, a number of organizations and projects worldwide.  As the current chair of the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Association]], AMIA works with other international audiovisual archives associations to promote the work done by archivists and to influence the development of public policy on issues of importance to the preservation of our audiovisual heritage.

On October 27 each year AMIA members participate in and promote the [[World Day for Audiovisual Heritage]].  In 2006 at its 33rd session the General Conference of UNESCO declared 27 October as World Day for Audiovisual Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO's World Day for Audiovisual Heritage|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/audiovisualday/background.shtml|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a unique occasion to raise awareness of the importance of sounds and images as a source of history of the last 150 years and of the importance of preserving them and making them accessible to whoever is interested in their content.

AMIA participation also includes the following: a founding member of NAANICA (North American Archival Network), a branch of [[International Council on Archives|ICA]]; a founding member of the United States Committee of the Blue Shield, a branch of [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]]; representation on the [[National Film Preservation Board]]; a member of the [[Digital Promise]] coalition; and maintains relationships with more than a dozen organizations with similar missions.

He was later imprisoned and eventually drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action; Eckler was sent to a [[concentration camp]] where it is presumed she was killed.

==Biography==
August Landmesser was the only child of August Franz Landmesser and Wilhelmine Magdalene (née Schmidtpott). In 1931, hoping it would help him get a job, he joined the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935, when he became engaged to Irma Eckler (a [[German Jews|Jewish]] woman), he was expelled from the party.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first=François |date= 2013-06-06|title=Comprendre Hitler et les allemands |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YZDlPnzTWU4C&amp;pg=PT24&amp;q=%22august%20landmesser%22 |location=[[Paris, France]] |publisher=''[[Éditions Max Milo]]'' |isbn=9782315004614 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They registered to be married in Hamburg, but the [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted a month later prevented it. On 29 October 1935, Landmesser and Eckler's first daughter, Ingrid, was born.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt;

A now-famous photograph, in which a man identified as Landmesser refuses to give the Nazi salute, was taken on 13 June 1936.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Flock |first=Elizabeth |date=7 February 2012 |title=August Landmesser, shipyard worker in Hamburg, refused to perform Nazi salute (photo) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/august-landmesser-shipyard-worker-in-hamburg-refused-to-perform-nazi-salute-photo/2012/02/07/gIQA1ZzExQ_blog.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth|Washington Post Media]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Landmesser and Eckler tried to flee to Denmark but were apprehended. She was again pregnant, and he was charged and found guilty in July 1937 of "[[Rassenschande|dishonoring the race]]" under Nazi racial laws. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew that she was fully Jewish, and was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence. The couple publicly continued their relationship, and on 15 July 1938 he was arrested again and sentenced to two and a half years in the [[Börgermoor]] [[concentration camp]].

Eckler was detained by the [[Gestapo]] and held at the prison [[Fuhlsbüttel]], where she gave birth to a second daughter, Irene.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt; From there she was sent to the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]], the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp]] for women, and then the women's concentration camp at [[Ravensbrück]]. A few letters came from Irma Eckler until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 killed; in the course of post-war documentation, in 1949 she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942.

Meanwhile, Landmesser was discharged from prison on 19 January 1941.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; He worked as a foreman for the [[haulage]] company Püst. The company had a branch at the Heinkel-Werke (factory) in [[Warnemünde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasena.de/courage/english/10.htm |title=Father reported missing |first1=Amanda |last1=Straße |date= |website=Fasena.de |publisher=[[1&amp;1 Internet]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1944 he was drafted into a [[Strafbattalion|penal battalion]], the [[999th Light Afrika Division (Wehrmacht)|999th Fort Infantry Battalion]]. He was declared [[killed in action]], after being killed during fighting in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] on 17 October 1944.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"&gt;{{cite book | title=Resisting the Holocaust: Upstanders, Partisans, and Survivors | last=Bartrop | first=Paul R. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXgiDAAAQBAJ | year=2016 | page=152 | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | location=| isbn=9781610698795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Eckler, he was legally declared dead in 1949.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"/&gt;

Their children were initially taken to the city orphanage. Ingrid was later allowed to live with her maternal grandmother while Irene went to the home of foster parents in 1941. Ingrid was also placed with foster parents after her grandmother's death in 1953.

The marriage of August Landmesser and Irma Eckler was recognized retroactively by the [[Senate of Hamburg]] in the summer of 1951, and in the autumn of that year Ingrid assumed the surname ''Landmesser''. Irene continued to use the surname ''Eckler''.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Irene Eckler published the book ''Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935–1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen "Rassenschande"'' (''The Guardianship Documents 1935–1958: Persecution of a Family for "Racial Disgrace"''). The book tells the story of her family, and includes a large number of original documents from the time in question, including letters from her mother and documents from state institutions.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

A figure identified by Irene Eckler as August Landmesser is featured in a photograph taken on 13 June 1936, published on 22 March 1991 in ''[[Die Zeit]]''. It shows a large gathering of workers at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, for the launching of the navy training ship ''Horst Wessel''.  Almost everyone in the image has raised his arm in the Nazi salute, with the most obvious exception of a man toward the back of the crowd, who grimly stands with his arms crossed over his chest. Several others have also refrained from saluting, but are not so obviously defiant.

Whether the depicted man is Landmesser is not known with certainty. Another family claims the person in the photo is another metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss, a man called Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Paul, Das Jahrhundert der Bilder 1900 bis 1949, Verlag Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht 2009, Seite 494 rechte Spalte Absatz 3), as quoted in [http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html]. Quote: „In the meantime another Family from Hamburg has identified the man as a relative. It should be Gustav Wegert (1890-1959) who worked as a metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss. As a believing Christian he generally refused the Nazi Salute. Despite his distance to the Nazi Regime Gustav Wegert did not get in the eye of the Nazi persecution administration. Portraits from Wegert and Landmesser prove in both cases great similarity with the worker on that picture. At this time it has to remain unsettled who the man in the picture is“.&lt;/ref&gt; The content and photos posted by relatives of Wegert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html|title=1936 - Just one refused the Nazi salute|website=wegert-familie.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent photographic enhancements make it more likely that the person in the photo refusing to perform the Nazi salute was Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2014/10/26/german-non-saluter-myth/|title=The German Non-Saluter Myth - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=26 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}

The '''Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation''' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] institution under private law and of general public utility, perpetual in nature, with its statutory purposes spanning the arts, beneficence, science, and education. Set up by the last will and testament of [[Calouste Gulbenkian|Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian]], who bequeathed his assets to the country in the form of a foundation with its statutes approved by the Portuguese state on 18 July 1956.

==Organization==
[[File:Gulbenkian April 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Gulbenkian Park]] of the Gulbenkian Foundation and Museum]]

The head office of the Foundation is located in [[Lisbon]]. The premises opened in 1969, consisting of the head office and the museum, and were designed by [[Ruy Athouguia]], [[Pedro Cid]], and [[Alberto Pessoa]]. In addition to the areas occupied by the foundation's management and various departments there is an auditorium, an exhibition space, a congress area with auditoriums and other rooms as well as a large building that houses the Foundation's museum and the art library. The entire complex is set in Gulbenkian Park, which was designed by [[Ribeiro Telles]]. In 1983, the Modern Art Centre, consisting of a museum and an education centre, was opened at one end of the park. 

===Calouste Gulbenkian Museum===
{{Main|Calouste Gulbenkian Museum}}
The [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] ({{lang-pt|Museu Calouste Gulbenkian}}) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] museum in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Avenidas Novas]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Lisbon]]. Founded in conformity with [[Calouste Gulbenkian]]'s last will and testament, the museum accommodates the art collection of the similarly-named Foundation, that includes ancient and, some, modern art.

===Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência===
{{Main|Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência}}
The ''[[Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência]]'' (IGC, a science institute) is situated inside a multi-building complex in [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] (outskirts of Lisbon), near the palace of the [[Marquis of Pombal]]. The institute is an international centre for biological and [[biomedical research]] and graduate training. Founded in 1961, and still supported by the Gulbenkian Foundation, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure. The scientific programme is multidisciplinary, including Cell and [[Developmental biology]], [[Evolutionary biology]], [[Immunology]], [[Host-pathogen interaction]], Disease Genetics, [[Botany|Plant Biology]], [[Neuroscience]]s, Theoretical and [[Computational biology]].

===Gulbenkian Orchestra===

The orchestra primarily gives concerts at the ''Grande Auditório'' (Grand Auditorium) of the Gulbenkian Foundation. The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation founded the orchestra in 1962 as the ''Orquestra de Câmara Gulbenkian'' (Gulbenkian Chamber Orchestra), consisting of 12 musicians. The ensemble subsequently expanded in size and took on its current name in 1971.

===Gulbenkian Ballet===
Gulbenkian ballet was a Portuguese classic dance troupe created in 1965 by the Foundation as Centro Português do Bailado.

Since then the choir made up of an average 100 members is directed by Michel Corboz.

===Branches===
The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation also has a delegation in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK Branch) and a centre in [[Paris]] (the Calouste Gulbenkian Cultural Centre).

[[File:CropCircleW.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of a crop circle in Switzerland]]
A '''crop circle''' or '''crop formation''' is a pattern created by flattening a [[crop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crop-circle?q=crop+circle|title=crop circle - Definition of crop circle in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually a [[cereal]]. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Andrews, Pat Delgado ''Circular Evidence: A Detailed Investigation of the Flattened Swirled Crops''. Phanes Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-7475-0635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop circles have been described as all falling "within the range of the sort of thing done in [[hoax]]es" by [[Taner Edis]], professor of physics at [[Truman State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Edis, Taner.

The number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them.

== History ==

The concept of "crop circles" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see [[#Bower and Chorley|Bower and Chorley]], below).&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Demon-Haunted World]] |author= Carl Sagan |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |pages= 72–76|isbn= 0747251568 |publisher= [[Headline Publishing Group]] |ref= {{harvid|Sagan|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGEO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |author1= Rob Irving |author2= Peter Brookesmith |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Crop-Circles-The-Art-of-the-Hoax.html |title= Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |work= Smithsonian.com |date= December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that they were inspired by the [[Tully, Queensland|Tully]] "saucer nest" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;

=== Before the 20th century ===

A 1678 news pamphlet ''[[Mowing-Devil|The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire]]'' is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; (see [[#Folklore|folklore section]]).

In 1686, British [[naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see [[fairy ring]]s) in ''The Natural History of Stafford-Shire'' and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause.&lt;ref name=NatHist&gt;{{cite book |author= John Aubrey |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |title= The Natural History of Stafford-Shire |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402233131/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |archivedate= 2 April 2007 |df= dmy-all }} at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhiloTrans&gt;{{cite journal |title= ''The Natural History of Staffordshire'' by Robert Plott; ''Sciotericum Telescopicum or a new Contrivance of adapting a Telescope to a Horizontall Diall, for observing the moment of time by day or night'' by Will Molineux |journal= Philosophical Transactions |volume= 16 (1686–1692) |jstor= 101866 |pages= 207–16 |department= Accounts of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by [[Erich von Däniken]].{{refn|group=n|Keving Greene wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulties that exist in communicating the results of archaeology have undoubtedly contributed to the flourishing of writers, such as Erich von Däniken, who take a particular delight in deriding the inability of 'experts' to find explanations that seize the imagination of the public.

Few archaeologists have sold as many paperbacks as von Däniken; more recently, a meteorologist who linked crop circles to prehistoric ring-ditches or round barrows generated a reaction that no orthodox student of these monuments has ever achieved (Meaden 1991) [in reference to {{cite book |author= T.

An 1880 letter to the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by amateur scientist [[John Rand Capron]] describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.{{refn|name="Capron1880"|group=n|John Rand Capron wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The storms about this part of Surrey have been lately local and violent, and the effects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour's farm on Wednesday evening (21st), we found a field of standing wheat considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots (...) they all presented much the same character, viz, a few standing stalks as a centre, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside there a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered. (...) I could not trace locally any circumstances accounting for the peculiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall.

=== 20th century ===
In 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: "a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up."&lt;ref&gt;Sussex Notes and Queries, 1937 Eliot Cecil Curwen pp. 139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, amateur astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of "spiral flattening". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.&lt;ref&gt;Moore P. ‘That Wiltshire Crater’ Letter to the editor ''New Scientist'' 8 August 1963
{{blockquote|1=In the adjoining wheatfields were other features, taking the form of circular or elliptical areas in which the wheat had been flattened. I saw these myself; they had not been much visited, and were certainly peculiar One, very well-defined, was an oval 15 yards long by 41 broad. There was evidence of "spiral flattening", and in one case there was a circular area in the centre in which the wheat had not been flattened. In no case was there any evidence of an actual depression in the ground.

(...) [The crater] could have been caused by natural subsidence, but it did not give that impression, and in any case there are the areas of flattened wheat to be taken into account; it would be remarkable coincidence if these areas were not associated with the crater. Since the areas of flattened wheat "led" to the crater, it looks very much as though they, and the crater, were caused by something which came from the sky. In this case, the wheat would have been flattened by violent air-currents produced by the falling body.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Hugh Ernest Butler]] observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ernest Butler 'That Wiltshire Crater', ''New Scientist'' issue 352, 15 August 1963 Letters to the editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, in [[Tully, Queensland]], Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in [[Duhamel, Alberta]], Canada; [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ufo/002029-1200-e.html |title= Canada's Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown: Duhamel, Alberta: August 1967 |date= 14 December 2007 |origyear= 2005}} At Library and Archives Canada. ([http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ovni/002029-1200.01-f.html Original] in French).&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous case is the 1966 Tully "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or {{convert|40|ft|m}} from a swamp and then fly away.

In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the "saucer" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The flattened crops society |work= [[The Scotsman]] |date= September 7, 2002 | author= Jim Gilchrist |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12991491.html }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in [[Wiltshire]], and there were rumours of "saucer nests" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; In ''[[Fortean Times]]'' David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near [[Gloucestershire]] using ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eddie|2004}} citing: {{cite journal |author= D.

This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in [[Hampshire]] and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada.

Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name=NGEO&gt;{{cite news |author= Hillary Mayell |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles.html |title= Crop circles: Artwork or alien signs |page= [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles_2.html 2] |magazine= National Geographic |date= 2 August 2002 |accessdate= 28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.

=== 21st century ===
Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Benjamin Radford |url= http://www.livescience.com/6546-beautiful-math-equation-crop-circle.html |title= 'Beautiful Math Equation' Found in Crop Circle |work= [[LiveScience]] |date= 8 June 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Marc West |date= 2008-06-30 |url= http://plus.maths.org/content/pi-appears-crop-circle |title= Pi appears in crop circle |work= plus.maths.org. |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/crop-circle-season-arrives-with-a-mathematical-message-1982647.html |title= Crop circle season arrives with a mathematical message |department= This Britain |newspaper= The Independent |date= 2010-05-26 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]]. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]], long barrows such as [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], and [[:Category:White horses in England|white horses in chalk hills]].&lt;ref name="northcote"/&gt;

== Bower and Chorley ==
In 1991, self-professed [[practical joke|pranksters]] Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line.&lt;ref name="today91"&gt;{{cite news |author= Graham Brough |year= 1991 |title= Men who conned the world |newspaper= Today (defunct) |location= UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a "cereologist" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 'Jovial Con Men' Demystify Those Crop Circles in Britain |newspaper= New York Times |author= William E.

== Legal implications ==
In 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in [[agriculture]], created a {{convert|36|m|adj=on}} diameter crop circle in a wheat field near [[Székesfehérvár]], {{convert|43|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Budapest]], on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian forint|Ft]] (~$3,000 USD) in [[damages]]. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000&amp;nbsp;Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media's promotion of the circle.

== Creation ==
[[File:Swiss crop circle detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of a crop circle in a field in Switzerland]]
The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, [[advertising]], or [[Crop art#Crop circles|art]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;

Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |title= Crop-circle mania: An investigative update |journal= Skeptical Inquirer}} Cited as reference 6 in {{harvnb|Nickell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Bower and Chorley and tabloid ''Today'' hoaxing Pat Delgado,&lt;ref name="today91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"/&gt; the Wessex Sceptics and [[Channel 4]]'s ''Equinox'' hoaxing Terence Meaden,&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"&gt;{{cite news |title= Flattened.

Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the [[Internet]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising.&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|name= "Cohen2008"}} Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,{{refn|group=n|The website Crop Circle Research.com described one formation stating, "It looks reminiscent of a fake dummy constructed by 'Balok' in a Star Trek episode called '[[The Corbomite Maneuver|Corbomite Manourvre]]'{{sic}} (series 1)' or the logo of local soccer club [[Feyenoord]]".{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}}}}

== Alternative explanations ==
=== Weather ===
It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak [[tornado]]es to [[ball lightning]], but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/circular_reasoning_the_mystery_of_crop_circles_and_their_orbs_of_light/ |title= Circular Reasoning: The 'Mystery' of Crop Circles and Their 'Orbs' of Light |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 26.5 |date=September–October 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206012813/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-09/crop-circles.html |archivedate= 2006-12-06 |deadurl= no |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal ''Nature'' about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was "suggestive of some cyclonic wind action".{{refn|group=n|name= "Capron1880"}}

In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic "plasma vortex".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] who said that, "Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2011|title=Coming soon to a field near you|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/richardtaylor/files/2015/12/CropCirclesphysicsworld-1o814jx.pdf|department=Feature: Crop circles|journal=Physics World|ref={{harvid|Taylor|2011}}|author=Richard Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles.{{refn|group=n|name="Taylor2011_note"|In a ''Physics World'' article Richard Taylor wrote, "Today, with the benefit of hindsight, such explanations sound rather contrived. At the height of the debate, though, no less a physicist than Stephen Hawking was prepared to accept some version of Meaden's theory. When a spate of circles appeared in the countryside near his Cambridge home in 1991, Hawking told a local newspaper that "crop circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Simon Hoggart |author2= Mike Hutchinson |year= 1995 |title= Bizarre Beliefs |location= London |publisher= Richard Cohen Books |page= 59 |isbn= 9781573921565}} Cited in {{harvnb|Nickell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various [[paranormal]], [[ufology|ufological]], and [[forteana|anomalistic]] investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5777580/Mayan-apocalypse-crop-circle-appears-at-Silbury-Hill.html |title= Mayan 'apocalypse' crop circle appears at Silbury Hill |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1&gt;{{cite book |author= Eltjo Haselhoff |year= 2001 |title= The Deepening Complexity of Crop Circles: Scientific Research &amp; Urban Legends |publisher= Frog Ltd |isbn= 1583940464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark1&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jerome Clark |author2= Nancy Pear |year= 1995 |title= Strange and Unexplained Happenings: When Nature Breaks the Rules of Science |publisher= [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |volume= 3 |isbn= 0810397803}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1/&gt;{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 138–39}}&lt;ref name=faussett1&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Godfrey-Faussett |year= 2004 |title= England |series= Footprint Travel Guides |isbn= 1903471915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many  [[New Age]] groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.

Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}} Some proposed entities are: [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] asking to stop [[global warming]] and human [[pollution]], God, supernatural beings (for example Indian [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed "quantum field", or extraterrestrial beings.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}}

Responding to local beliefs that "extraterrestrial beings" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) described crop circles as "man-made". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, "We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven." Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and [[anomalistics|anomalistic]] investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] by [[scientific skepticism|sceptical]] groups and scientists, including the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author= John Vidal |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/05/ruralaffairs |title= The bizarre revival of crop circles – and advice on how to make your own |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickell1996&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=June 1996 |volume= 6.2 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/levengoods_crop-circle_plant_research |title=Levengood’s crop-circle plant research |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=levengood1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.C.

=== Animal activity ===
In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of [[Tasmania]] stated that Australian [[Wallaby|wallabies]] had been found creating crop circles in fields of [[opium poppy|opium poppies]], which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper= BBC News | date= 25 June 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8118257.stm|title=Stoned wallabies make crop circles|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to crops ===
A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late&lt;!--described as semi-retired by csicop source--&gt; biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt;

Levengood published papers in journal ''[[Physiologia Plantarum]]'' in 1994&lt;ref name=levengood1994 /&gt; and 1999.&lt;ref name=levengood1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1= W.C. Levengood |author2= Nancy P. Talbott |year= 1999 |title= Dispersion of energies in worldwide crop formations |journal= Physiologia Plantarum |volume= 105 |pages= 615–24 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle.&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; In 1996 sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] objected that [[correlation is not causation]],&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; raised several objections to the Levengood's methods and assumptions,&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt; and said "Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites." (in reference to [[cattle mutilation]]).&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt;

A study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the [[pulvini]] of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, "suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood's observations of stunted seed growth."

=== Magnetism ===
In 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the [[Earth's magnetic field]], that creates a current that "electrocutes" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/872142.stm | title=Magnetic 'solution' to crop circle puzzle | work=BBC News | date=9 August 2000 | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old [[Folklore|folkloric]] tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 152}}

Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of "[[Fairy ring|fairie rings]]".&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Tales also mention [[Will-o'-the-wisp|balls of light]] many times but never in relation to crop circles.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

[[File:Diablefaucheur.jpg|thumb|upright|1678 pamphlet on the "[[Mowing-Devil]]".]]

A 17th-century English [[woodcut]] called the ''[[Mowing-Devil]]'' depicts the [[devil]] with a [[scythe]] mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The [[pamphlet]] containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have "the devil himself" perform the task.  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

In the 1948 German story ''Die zwölf Schwäne'' (''The Twelve Swans''), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve [[swan maiden|princesses disguised as swans]], who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

[[File:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paolo Uccello]]'s depiction of [[Saint George]] and the dragon, c. 1470, a classic image of a damsel in distress.]]

The '''damsel-in-distress''', '''persecuted maiden''', or '''princess in jeopardy''' is a classic theme in world literature, art, film and video games; most notably in those that have a lot of action. This [[fantasy tropes|trope]] usually involves beautiful, innocent, or helpless young female leads, placed in a dire predicament by a [[villain]], [[monster]] or [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and who requires a male [[hero]] to achieve her rescue. Often these young women are stereotyped as very physically weak and almost completely dependent on the male lead. After rescuing her, the hero often obtains her hand in marriage. She has become a [[stock character]] of fiction, particularly of [[melodrama]]. Though she is usually human, she can also be of any other species, including fictional or [[folklore|folkloric]] species; and even divine figures such as an [[angel]], [[spirit]], or [[deity]].

The word "damsel" derives from the French ''[[wikt:demoiselle|demoiselle]]'', meaning "young lady", and the term "damsel in distress" in turn is a translation of the French ''demoiselle en détresse''.{{cn|date=May 2017}} It is an archaic term not used in modern English except for effect or in expressions such as this. It can be traced back to the [[knight-errant]] of Medieval songs and tales, who regarded protection of women as an essential part of his [[chivalric code]] which includes a notion of [[honour]] and [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]] remarks in his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', "the source of the chivalrous idea, is pride aspiring to beauty, and formalised pride gives rise to a conception of honour, which is the pole of noble life". Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:58.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term "damsel in distress" itself first seems to have appeared in Richard Ames' 1692 poem "Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ames|first=Richard|title=Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness : a Poem, Being the Second Part of Sylvia’s Revenge, Or, a Satyr Against Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDW-gC3gqx8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=1692|publisher=Richard Baldwin|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 011.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] chained to the rock – a late-[[Renaissance]] damsel in distress from Greek mythology.]]

The damsel in distress theme featured in the stories of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. [[Greek mythology]], while featuring a large retinue of competent [[List of Greek mythological figures|goddesses]], also contains helpless maidens threatened with sacrifice. For example, [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]'s [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|mother]] offended [[Poseidon]], who sent a beast to ravage the land. To appease him Andromeda's parents fastened her to a rock in the sea. The hero [[Perseus]] slew the beast, saving Andromeda. Andromeda in her plight, chained naked to a rock, became a favorite theme of later painters. This theme of the [[Princess and dragon]] is also pursued in the myth of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St George]].

Another early example of a damsel in distress is [[Sita]] in the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]''. In the epic, Sita is kidnapped by the villain [[Ravana]] and taken to [[Lanka]]. Her husband [[Rama]] goes on a quest to rescue her, with the help of the monkey-god [[Hanuman]].

=== Post-classical history ===
European [[fairy tale]]s frequently feature damsels in distress. Evil witches trapped [[Rapunzel]] in a tower, cursed the princess to die in "[[Snow White]]", and put [[Sleeping Beauty]] into a magical sleep. In all of these, a valorous prince comes to the maiden's aid, saves her, and marries her (though Rapunzel is not directly saved by the prince, but instead saves him from blindness after her exile).

The damsel in distress was an archetypal character of medieval romances, where typically she was rescued from imprisonment in a tower of a castle by a knight-errant. [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'' of the repeated trials and bizarre torments of patient Griselda was drawn from [[Petrarch]]. The [[Emprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche]] (founded 1399) was a [[chivalric order]] with the express purpose of protecting oppressed ladies.

The theme also entered the official [[hagiography]] of the Catholic Church – most famously in the story of [[Saint George]] who saved a princess from being devoured by a [[dragon]]. A late addition to the official account of this Saint's life, not attested in the several first centuries when he was venerated, it is nowadays the main act for which Saint George is remembered.

Obscure outside [[Norway]] is [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson]], the Patron Saint of [[Oslo]], recognised as a martyr after being killed while valiantly trying to defend a woman – most likely a [[slavery|slave]] – from three men accusing her of theft.

===Modern history===

====17th century====

In the 17th century English [[ballad]] ''[[The Spanish Lady]]'' (one of several English and Irish songs with that name), a Spanish lady captured by an English captain falls in love with her captor and begs him not to set her free but to take her with him to England, and in this appeal describes herself as "A lady in distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title = Spanish Lady
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====18th century====

[[File:Dicksee-Chivalry-1885.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Bernard Dicksee]]. ''Chivalry'']]

The damsel in distress makes her debut in the modern novel as the title character of [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1748), where she is menaced by the wicked seducer Lovelace.

Reprising her medieval role, the damsel in distress is a staple character of [[Gothic literature]], where she is typically incarcerated in a castle or monastery and menaced by a sadistic nobleman, or members of the religious orders. Early examples in this genre include Matilda in [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', Emily in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', and Antonia in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]' ''[[The Monk]]''.

The perils faced by this Gothic heroine were taken to an extreme by the [[Marquis de Sade]] in ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', who exposed the [[erotic]] subtext which lay beneath the damsel-in-distress scenario.

[[File:The Knight Errant b John Everett Millais 1870.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]]' ''The Knight Errant'' of 1870 saves a damsel in distress and underlines the erotic subtext of the genre.]]
One exploration of the theme of the persecuted maiden is the fate of Gretchen in [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']]. According to the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The great Goethe has given us a distinct and visible description of this denial of the will, brought about by great misfortune and by the despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece Faust, in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know of no other description in poetry. It is a perfect specimen of the second path, which leads to the denial of the will not, like the first, through the mere knowledge of the suffering of the whole world which one acquires voluntarily, but through the excessive pain felt in one's own person. It is true that many tragedies bring their violently willing heroes ultimately to this point of complete resignation, and then the will-to-live and its phenomenon usually end at the same time. But no description known to me brings to us the essential point of that conversion so distinctly and so free from everything extraneous as the one mentioned in Faust'' ([[The World as Will and Representation]], Vol. I, §68)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====19th century====

The misadventures of the damsel in distress of the Gothic continued in a somewhat caricatured form in Victorian [[melodrama]]. According to Michael Booth in his classic study ''English Melodrama'' the Victorian stage melodrama featured a limited number of stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an old man, an old woman, a comic man and a comic woman engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes to ensure the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Michael |last = Booth |title = English Melodrama |publisher = Herbert Jenkins |year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such melodrama influenced the fledgling cinema industry and led to damsels in distress being the subject of many early silent films, especially those that were made as multi-episode serials. Early examples include ''[[The Adventures of Kathlyn]]'' in 1913 and ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'', which ran from 1914 to 1917. The silent movie heroines frequently faced new perils provided by the industrial revolution and catering to the new medium's need for visual spectacle. Here we find the heroine tied to a railway track, burning buildings, and explosions. Sawmills were another stereotypical danger of the industrial age, as recorded in a popular song from a later era:
{{cquote|... A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was chasin' poor Sweet Sue&lt;br&gt;
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh,&lt;br&gt;
If you don't give me the deed to your ranch&lt;br&gt;
I'll saw you all in half!&lt;br&gt;
And then he grabbed her (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He tied her up (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He turned on the bandsaw (and then, and then...!) ...

====20th century====
[[File:Perilsofnyoka.JPG|thumb|Jungle girl Nyoka, played by [[Kay Aldridge]], frequently found herself in distress in ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'']]

During the [[First World War]], the imagery of a Damsel in Distress was extensively used in Allied propaganda (see illustrations). Particularly, the Imperial German conquest and occupation of Belgium was commonly referred to as [[The Rape of Belgium]] - effectively making British and French soldiers into knights bent on saving that rape victim. This was expressed explicitly in the lyrics of ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song) |Keep the Home Fires Burning]]'' mentioning British boys as having gone to help a "Nation in Distress". 

A form of entertainment in which the damsel-in-distress emerged as a stereotype at this time was [[stage magic]]. Restraining attractive female assistants and imperiling them with blades and spikes became a staple of 20th century magicians' acts. Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] identifies the beginning of this phenomenon as coinciding with the introduction of the "[[sawing a woman in half]]" illusion. In 1921 magician [[P. T. Selbit]] became the first to present such an act to the public. Steinmeyer observes that: "Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions". However, changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. The trauma of war had helped to desensitise the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were tiring of older, more genteel forms of magic. It took something shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book |title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible |first = Jim |last = Steinmeyer |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House |year = 2003 |pages = 277–295 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damsel-in-distress continued as a mainstay of the comics, film, and television industries throughout the 20th century. Imperiled heroines in need of rescue were a frequent occurrence in black-and-white [[film serial]]s made by studios such as [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Republic Pictures]], and [[Universal Studios]], and in the 1930s, 40s and early 50s. These serials sometimes drew inspiration for their characters and plots from adventure novels and comic books. Notable examples include the character [[Nyoka the Jungle Girl]], whom [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] created for comic books and who was later adapted into a serial heroine in Republic productions such as ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'' (1942). Additional classic damsels in that mold were [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], in both the novel and movie versions of ''[[Tarzan]]'', and Ann Darrow, as played by [[Fay Wray]] in the movie ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), in one of the most iconic instances. The notorious hoax documentary ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930) also featured this idea, and Wray's role was repeated by [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Naomi Watts]] in remakes. As journalist Andrew Erish has noted: "Gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits".&lt;ref name="Erish"&gt;{{Cite journal |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+8%2C+2006&amp;author=Andrew+Erish&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.6&amp;desc=Movies |title = Illegitimate dad of 'Kong'; One of the Depression's highest-grossing films was an outrageous fabrication, a scandalous and suggestive gorilla epic that set box office records across the country |first = Andrew |last = Erish |journal = Los Angeles Times |publisher = Los Angeles Times |date = 8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small screen iconic portrayal, this time in children's cartoons, was [[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'s girlfriend, [[List of Underdog characters#Sweet Polly Purebred|Sweet Polly Purebred]].

Frequently cited examples of a damsel in distress in comics include [[Lois Lane]], who was eternally getting into trouble and needing to be rescued by [[Superman]], and [[Olive Oyl]], who was in a near-constant state of [[kidnapping|kidnap]], requiring her to be saved by [[Popeye]].

Damsels in distress have been cited as an example of differential treatment of genders in literature, film, and works of art. Feminist criticism of art, [[feminist film theory|film]], and [[feminist literary criticism|literature]] has often examined gender-oriented characterisation and plot, including the common "damsel in distress" trope, as perpetrating regressive and patronizing myths about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/damsel-in-distress-part-2-tropes-vs-women/|title=Damsel in Distress (Part 2) Tropes vs Women|date=28 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Alison Lurie, "Fairy Tale Liberation", ''The New York Review of Books'', v. 15, n. 11 (Dec. 17, 1970) (germinal work in the field); Donald Haase, "Feminist Fairy-Tale Scholarship: A Critical Survey and Bibliography", ''Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies'' v.14, n.1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern writers and directors, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Angela Carter]] and [[Jane Yolen]], have revisited classic [[fairy tale]]s and "damsel in distress" stories or collected and anthologised stories and [[Folklore|folk tales]] that break{{huh|date=January 2017}} the "damsel in distress" pattern.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Yolen, "This Book Is For You", ''Marvels &amp; Tales'', v. 14, n. 1 (2000) (essay); Yolen, ''Not One Damsel in Distress: World folktales for Strong Girls'' (anthology); Jack Zipes, ''Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Fairy Tales in North America and England'', Routledge: New York, 1986 (anthology).&lt;/ref&gt; 

While late twentieth-century feminist criticism may have highlighted alternatives to the damsel stereotype, the origins of some alternatives are to be found elsewhere. [[Joseph Campbell]]'s work on comparative mythology has provided a theoretical model for heroes throughout the history of literature, drama, and film, which has been further developed by [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] writers such as [[Christopher Vogler]]. These theories suggest that within the underlying story arc of every hero is found an episode known as the [[Monomyth#Initiation|ordeal]], where the character is almost destroyed. By surviving fear, danger, or torture the hero proves he or she has special qualities and ultimately emerges re-invented to progress to ultimate victory. Within this theory the empowered "damsel" can be a female hero rendered powerless and imperilled during her heroic ordeal but who ultimately emerges as a strong figure who claims victory; yet the male and female versions of such ordeal and empowerment still differ at a fundamental level, in that when there is a character doing the rescuing (sometimes referred to as "help unlooked for"), he is almost invariably male.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Empowered damsel==
Examples can be found in films that date back to the early days of movie making. One of the films most often associated with the stereotype of the damsel in distress, ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), in fact provides at least a partial counterexample, in that Pauline, as played by [[Pearl White]], is a strong character who decides against early marriage in favour of seeking adventure and becoming an author. Despite common belief, the film does not feature scenes with Pauline tied to a railroad track and threatened by a buzzsaw, although such scenes were incorporated into later re-creations and were also featured in other films made in the period around 1914. Academic Ben Singer has contested the idea that these "serial-queen melodramas" were male fantasies and has observed that they were marketed heavily at women.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first motion picture serial made in the United States, ''[[What Happened to Mary?]]'' (1912), was released to coincide with a serial story of the same name published in McClure's ''Ladies' World'' magazine.

Empowered damsels were a feature of the serials made in the 1930s and 1940s by studios such as [[Republic Pictures]]. The "cliffhanger" scenes at the end of episodes provide many examples of female heroines bound and helpless and facing fiendish death traps. But those heroines, as played by actresses such as [[Linda Stirling]] and [[Kay Aldridge]], were often strong, assertive women who ultimately played an active part in vanquishing the villains.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

[[C.L. Moore]]'s 1934 story "[[Shambleau]]" – generally acknowledged as epoch-making in the history of [[science fiction]] – begins in what seems a classical damsel in distress situation: the protagonist, space adventurer [[Northwest Smith]], sees a "sweetly-made girl" pursued by a lynch mob intent on killing her and intervenes to save her, but finds her not a girl nor a human being at all, but a disguised alien creature, predatory and highly dangerous. Soon, Smith himself needs rescuing and barely escapes with his life.

These themes have received successive updates in modern-era characters, ranging from 'spy girls' of the 1960s to current movie and television heroines. In her book ''The Devil With James Bond'' (1967) Ann Boyd compared [[James Bond]] with an updating of the legend of [[St George]] and the "[[princess and dragon]]" genre, particularly with [[Julius No|Dr. No]]'s dragon tank. The damsel in distress theme is also very prominent in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', where the story is told in the [[First person narrative|first person]] by the young woman [[Vivienne Michel]], who is threatened with imminent rape by thugs when Bond kills them and claims her as his reward.

The female spy [[Emma Peel]] in the 1960s British television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was often seen in "damsel in distress" situations. The character and her reactions, as portrayed by actress [[Diana Rigg]], differentiated these scenes from other movie and television scenarios where women were similarly imperilled as pure victims or pawns in the plot. A scene with Emma Peel bound and threatened with a death ray in the episode ''From Venus with Love'' is a direct parallel to James Bond's confrontation with a laser in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.&lt;ref name="fromvenus"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are examples of the classic hero's ordeal as described by Campbell and Vogler. The serial heroines and Emma Peel are cited as providing inspiration for the creators of strong heroines in more recent times. Ranging from Joan Wilder in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and [[Princess Leia]] in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' to "post feminist" icons such as [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]] from ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'',  [[Sydney Bristow]] from ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', [[Natasha Romanoff]] from [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] from the series of the [[Kim Possible|same name]], [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] from [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]], and [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] also from the series of the [[Veronica Mars|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reflecting these changes, [[Daphne Blake]] of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' cartoon series (who throughout the series is captured dozens of times, falls through trap doors, etc.) is portrayed in the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo film]] as a wisecracking feminist heroine (quote: "I've had it with this damsel in distress thing!"). The 2009 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' includes a classical damsel in distress episode, where [[Irene Adler]] (played by [[Rachel McAdams]]) is helplessly bound to a conveyor belt in an industrial slaughterhouse, and is saved from being sawn in half by a chainsaw; yet in other episodes of the same film Adler is strong and assertive – for example, overcoming with contemptuous ease two thugs who sought to rob her (and robbing them instead). In the film's climax it is Adler who saves the [[British Empire]], dismantling at the last moment a device set to poison the entire membership of Parliament.

In the final scene of the 2007 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' the traditional roles are reversed when male protagonist Robert ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) is captured by Queen Narissa ([[Susan Sarandon]]) in her dragon form. In a [[King Kong]] fashion, she carries him to the top of a New York skyscraper, until Robert's beloved [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] climbs, sword in hand, to save him.

A similar role reversal is evident in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', in whose climatic scene the male protagonist is captured by a mass murderer, locked in an underground torture room, chained, stripped naked, and humiliated when his female partner enters to save him and destroy the villain. Still another example is ''[[Foxglove Summer]]'', part of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series - where the protagonist Peter Grant is bound and taken captive by the Queen of the Faeries, and it is Grant's girlfriend who comes to rescue him, riding a Steel Horse.

In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (1844), the protagonist Gerda, a little girl, rescues her friend Kai, a little boy, from the Snow Queen. In the 2013 film adaptation ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', Gerda and Kai are substituted with the sisters Anna and Elsa respectively.

'''Elias Menachem Stein''' (born January 13, 1931) is a [[mathematician]]. He is a leading figure in the field of [[harmonic analysis]]. He is a professor emeritus of [[Mathematics]] at [[Princeton University]].

==Biography==
Stein was born to Elkan Stein and Chana Goldman, [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=StAndrews&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Stein.html University of St Andrews, Scotland - School of Mathematics and Statistics: "Elias Menachem Stein" by J.J. O'Connor and E F Robertson] February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion in 1940]], the Stein family fled to the [[United States]], first arriving in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1949,&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; where he was classmates with future [[Fields Medalist]] [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourstrongband.org/history/timeline-1940.html |title=Stuyvesant High School Endowment Fund |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111165649/http://www.ourstrongband.org/history/timeline-1940.html |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving on to the [[University of Chicago]] for college. In 1955, Stein earned a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] under the direction of [[Antoni Zygmund]]. He began teaching in [[MIT]] in 1955, moved to the University of Chicago in 1958 as an assistant professor, and in 1963 became a full professor at Princeton, the position he currently holds.

Stein has worked primarily in the field of [[harmonic analysis]], and has made contributions in both extending and clarifying [[Calderón–Zygmund theory]].  These include ''Stein interpolation'' (a variable-parameter version of [[complex interpolation]]), the ''Stein maximal principle'' (showing that under many circumstances, [[almost everywhere convergence]] is equivalent to the boundedness of
a [[maximal function]]), ''[[Stein complementary series representation]]s'', ''Nikishin–Pisier–Stein factorization'' in operator theory, the ''Tomas–Stein restriction theorem'' in [[Fourier analysis]], the ''Kunze–Stein phenomenon'' in [[convolution]] on [[semisimple group]]s, the [[Cotlar–Stein lemma]] concerning the sum of almost orthogonal operators, and the Fefferman–Stein theory of the [[Hardy space]] &lt;math&gt;H^1&lt;/math&gt; and the space &lt;math&gt;BMO&lt;/math&gt; of functions of bounded mean oscillation.

He has written numerous books on harmonic analysis (see e.g. [1,3,5]), which are often cited as the standard references on the subject. His ''[[Princeton Lectures in Analysis]]'' series [6,7,8,9] were penned for his sequence of undergraduate courses on analysis at Princeton. Stein is also noted as having trained a high number of graduate students (he has had at least 51 students, according to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]), so shaping modern Fourier analysis. They include two [[Fields medal]]ists, [[Charles Fefferman]] and [[Terence Tao]].

His honors include the [[Steele Prize]] (1984 and 2002), the [[Schock Prize]] in Mathematics (1993), the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1999), and the [[National Medal of Science]] (2001). In addition, he has fellowships to [[National Science Foundation]], [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Foundation]], [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2005, Stein was awarded the [[Stefan Bergman]] prize in recognition of his contributions in real, complex, and harmonic analysis. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1959, he married Elly Intrator,&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; a former [[Jewish]] refugee during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://access.cjh.org/home.php?type=extid&amp;term=1525679#1 Center for Jewish History: "AHC interview with Elly Stein"] 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Karen Stein and [[Jeremy C. Stein]],&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; and grandchildren named Alison, Jason, and Carolyn. His son Jeremy is a  professor of financial economics at Harvard, former adviser to [[Tim Geithner]] and [[Lawrence Summers]], and was appointed to the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''European Design Awards''', also known as the ED-Awards, are annual awards presented to European designers for outstanding work in the communication design field. The ED-Awards is a joint initiative of design magazines from across Europe and endorsed by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico-d.org/connect/events/events/836.php ico-D endorsed events]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Icograda|International Council of Design]].
The ED-Awards are judged by a panel of representatives (journalists and design critics) from fifteen European design magazines, while the winning submissions are featured in the ED-Awards Catalogue.

==Model==
The ED-Awards is different than other design awards schemes in the way that the jury comprises not of peers (designers), but of design journalists and critics – people who see and judge work for a living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/european-design-still-exploring Eye Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
Further more, since the ED-Awards organisation is made up of design magazines, it provides an opportunity for everyone submitting work, to have it featured in a number of these media. A lot of stories and articles are being created through the submitted work every year.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, #21 March 2012, {{ISSN|0976-1659}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jury==

The jury consists of fifteen representatives from high-profile European design magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeandesign.org/ed-awards/jury/ Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foot of fine''' (plural, '''feet of fines'''; [[Latin]]: '''''pes finis'''''; plural, '''''pedes finium''''') is the archival copy of the agreement between two parties in an [[England|English]] [[lawsuit]] over land, most commonly the [[Legal fiction|fictitious]] suit (in reality a [[Conveyancing|conveyance]]) known as a [[fine of lands]] or final concord. The procedure was followed from ''c''.1195 until 1833, and the considerable body of resulting records is now held at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], [[Kew]], London.

==History==
In the reign of [[Henry II of England]], the royal justices first began the practice of registering the settlement of disagreements over land by having both parties bring a suit before the royal courts. The resulting decision was thus given ''royal sanction''.

At first, two copies of the agreement ("fine") were made, created as [[chirograph]]s: i.e. the text was written in duplicate on a single piece of parchment, which was then cut in half, one copy going to each of the litigants. Under [[Hubert Walter]]'s justiciarship, probably about 1195, the practice was started of writing the text in triplicate, so that a third copy could be filed in the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. This copy of the text was written at the foot of the piece of parchment, and so became known as the "foot of the fine", or simply "foot of fine".

The first recorded foot of fine is endorsed with the statement "This is the first [[chirograph]] that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury."&lt;ref name=QClanchy68&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.&lt;ref name=Clanchy68&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, the practice of recording feet of fines had spread widely, and even to Scotland, as in 1198 an agreement between [[William de Brus, 3rd Lord of Annandale|William de Bruce]] of Annandale and Adam of Carlisle over eight ploughgates in [[Lockerbie, Scotland|Lockerbie]], Scotland was filed with the English treasury, recorded with those from [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=Clanchy68/&gt; While early fines could be made in the [[Exchequer]], after the early 14th century, fines were always made in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].

The practice survived until fines were abolished by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833|Fines and Recoveries Act]] of 1833.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4824">'''Fetish art''' is [[art]] that depicts people in [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] situations such as [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], [[Domination and submission|domination/submission]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[transvestism]] and the like, sometimes in combination.

Fetish art can simply depict a person dressed in fetish clothing, which includes undergarments, stockings, high heels, corsets and boots.  A common fetish theme is a woman dressed as a [[dominatrix]].

Many of the 'classic' 1940s, 1950s and 1960s-era fetish artists such as [[Eric Stanton]] and [[Gene Bilbrew]] began their careers at [[Irving Klaw]]'s [[Movie Star News]] company (later Nutrix), creating drawings for episodic illustrated bondage stories.

In 1946 fetish artist John Coutts (a.k.a. [[John Willie]]) founded ''Bizarre'' magazine. Bizarre was first published in Canada, then printed in the U.S., and was the inspiration for a number of new [[fetish magazine]]s such as ''Bizarre Life''.&lt;ref name=Shorter&gt;{{cite book|title=Written in the flesh: a history of desire|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|author=Edward Shorter |year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5APaJ7yxVA4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-8020-3843-3|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 English engineer John Sutcliffe founded ''[[Atomage]]'' magazine, which featured images of the rubber clothing he had made.&lt;ref name=Shorter/&gt; Sutcliffe's work would inspire [[Dianna Rigg]]'s leather-catsuit-wearing character in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', a TV show that "opened the floodgates for fetish-SM images".&lt;ref name=Shorter/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, fetish artists like Robert Bishop were published extensively in [[bondage magazine]]s.  In recent years, the annual SIGNY awards have been awarded to the bondage artists voted the best of that year. Many artists working in the mainstream [[comic book]] industry have included fetishistic imagery in their work, usually as a shock tactic or to denote villainy or corruption. The boost that depictions of beautiful women in tight fetish outfits give to the sales of comics to a mostly teenage male comic-buying audience may also be a factor.

In 1950s America comics with bondage or fetish themes began appearing.&lt;ref name=Slade&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Joseph W. Slade |year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNTS4rmCO9kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-313-31519-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, fetish artists influenced the cartoons of [[George Petty]], [[Alberto Vargas]] and others, which featured in magazines like ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.&lt;ref name=Slade/&gt; Arguably the best known example of fetish imagery in comics is the catsuit-wearing, whip-wielding ''[[Catwoman]]'', who has been called, "an icon of fetish art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Amazons: warrior women on screen|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|author=Dominique Mainon, James Ursini |year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlKW5X7vccgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-87910-327-2|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many S&amp;M, leather and fetish artists have produced images depicting [[urine fetishism]] ("watersports"), including Domino, [[Tom of Finland]], Matt and The Hun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Soaked!: A Watersports Handbook for Men|publisher=[[Leather Archives &amp; Museum]]|author=Joseph W. Bean |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3f1wmiSu0MC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1-887895-39-6|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream fine artists such as [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]] have included strong fetish elements in their work. An artist whose [[erotica]] transcends to mainstream collectors is found in the Shunga and Shibari style works of [[Hajime Sorayama]]. [[Taschen]] books included artist Hajime Sorayama, whom his peer artists call a cross between [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Salvador Dali]], or an imaginative modern day Vargas. Sorayama's robotic diverse illustrative works are in the permanent collections of the [[New York City]] [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and the [[Smithsonian Institution]], as well as the fetish arts in the private [[World Erotic Art Museum Miami]] collection.

The works of contemporary fetish artists such as [[Roberto Baldazzini]] and [[Michael Manning (fetish artist)|Michael Manning]] are published by companies such as [[NBM Publishing]] and Taschen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32682">The official history of motion picture production in the State of [[Michigan]] dates back to the beginning of the [[Post–World War II baby boom]]. As of March 14, 2013, the Michigan Film Office website contains a list of 319, filmed in Michigan titles, beginning with ''[[This Time for Keeps]]'', starring [[Esther Williams]] and ([[Jimmy Durante]]) in 1946, followed by ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', starring [[Jimmy Stewart]] and [[Lee Remick]] in 1959.&lt;ref name = "Filmed in Michigan"/&gt;  Contemporary nationally known works filmed in the state include the drama [[Conviction (2010 film)|''Conviction'']] (2010), starring [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Sam Rockwell]],&lt;ref name="TimeMag"/&gt; ''[[Kill the Irishman]]'' (2011), starring [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Christopher Walken]],&lt;ref name="irish"/&gt; HBO's series [[Hung (TV series)|''Hung'']] was filmed, and is set in, Detroit,&lt;ref name="hung"/&gt; and the Discovery Channel's ''[[Motor City Motors]]'' (2009), formerly ''[[Monster Garage]]'' (2002-2006).&lt;ref name="Motor Garage"/&gt; Originally slated for [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[Clint Eastwood]]'s film [[Gran Torino (film)|''Gran Torino'']] (2008) was filmed in the Detroit area.&lt;ref name = "TimeMag"/&gt;

Changes to the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|dynamics of the automotive industry]] left the State of Michigan with vacant factories and commercial buildings, these buildings were well suited to be repurposed as [[sound stage]]s and [[Filmmaking|film production]] facilities.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; In 2008, Michigan offered nationally competitive [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film incentives]] that coincided with the [[Effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|automotive industry crisis]].&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; The Michigan Film Incentive effort was successful in creating a film production infrastructure and workforce, however the film incentive was scaled back and capped at $25 million per year by incoming [[Rick Snyder|Governor, Rick Snyder]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;  Negotiations between industry and the legislature resulted in a $50 million budget for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14, caps the film incentive budget at $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

Studio benefactors of the Michigan Film Incentive included: Raleigh Michigan Studios (Now known as [[Michigan Motion Picture Studios]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]),&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motown"/&gt; Detroit Center Studios/Wonderstruck (in [[Detroit]]),&lt;ref name="mgm"/&gt; [[10 West Studios]] (in [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]]) and now defunct Unity Studios ([[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]]).&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReelChicago/&gt;

== The Michigan Film Office ==
The Michigan Film Office is overseen by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and is a benefactor of the Michigan Strategic Fund.&lt;ref name="Strategic fund"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategic Fund Audit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFODuties/&gt; Formerly, an office consisting of one employee, under the umbrella of the History, Arts, and Libraries, staffing levels grew to six employees after film incentives were introduced in 2008.&lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt; Michelle Begnoche, Public Relations Manager of the Michigan Film Office explains the goal of the film incentive:  "The goal of the incentive is not to incentivize the movies that will make the most money; the goal of the film incentive is to incent those movies who will spend the most money in Michigan. So we are not looking at whether or not they get their money back. We are looking at how much are they going to spend on Michigan workers making that movie and how much are they going to spend in Michigan hotels and in the local areas while making that movie." &lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt;

:"The Michigan Film Office was created in 1979 to assist and attract incoming production companies and to promote the growth of our indigenous industry. It provides several services, such as location photographs; help with location procurement and clearance; liaison with local/county/state government; contacts with business, institutions, neighborhoods, and other groups; production information, and location assistance."
:: '''— Michigan Economic Development Corporation''' &lt;ref name="MFO defined"/&gt;

An organization known as the Michigan Production Alliance was formed as a 501c6 trade group in order to assist film community members with information, education and legislation with regard to the production industry in Michigan. The organization sent representatives to each legislative and non political meeting as the initial film incentives were being developed and assisted in helping both legislators and the general population understand why incentives are like economic development driving diversification for the state's economy.

=== The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive ===

The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive was signed into law on April 7, 2008, by Governor [[Jennifer M. Granholm]]([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]). The legislation included Public Acts 74 through 87 of 2008.&lt;ref name=MichiganLeg/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;  Introduced for the purpose of [[Workforce development|workforce]] and [[Infrastructure#Impact on economic development|infrastructure development]], a refundable or transferable tax incentive focuses on film, television and digital media production in the state of Michigan.  The pre-2012 enactment of the film incentive, included a 40-percent subsidy for covered personnel expenditures, with an additional two-percent available for projects produced in Michigan's 103 core communities. Above the line personnel, directors, writers, producers etc., were eligible for a 40% credit on salaries regardless of Michigan residency.  Below the line personnel, film industry craftsmen, technicians and engineers received a 40% credit if they were Michigan residents, or 30% for nonresidents.&lt;ref name="Above the line"/&gt;  Capped at $20 million annually,&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;{{rp|5}} the construction industry also benefited with a 25-percent subsidy for capital improvements, on the creation of new film-industry related facilities. The workforce development incentive also provided a Film and Digital Media Job Training Tax Credit, of 50-percent, for on the job training expenses of Michigan residents.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

Of the 35 states that provide film industry incentives, 13 were considered competitive in 2008, Michigan became one of the top 3 competitors with [[New Mexico]] and [[Louisiana]] in this group. In 2008, Michigan film industry expenditures grossed $125 million, up from $2 million in 2007, creating an estimated 2800 jobs with incentive outlays of $47,992,000.00.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

==== Film industry statistics ====
The 2007 Census reports that Michigan's participation in the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]] group, 512110 Motion picture and video production, had 923 employees participating in total salaries of $38.5 million annually ($41,767.00 average); the national employment pool, consisted of 142,620 employees, and generated salaries of $11.9 billion ($83,438.50 average) in the same year. Total industry revenues for, NAICS 512110 Motion picture and video production, was valued at $59.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt;  It must be kept in mind however that freelance or Seasonal employees who make up the film industry workforce are NOT counted in the NAICS audits because they do not work for a specific company and often work for several during a given year. This makes it hard to quantify the film industry labor force.

==== Four-year Overview ====

:Since the incentives took effect in 2008, the Film Office and the Department of Treasury have approved a total of $392,384,844 in film incentives on $1,003,835,842 in total qualified expenditures by productions in Michigan. This represents 229 projects that have been approved to date, including 164 projects that have actually wrapped the state.
::'''—Michigan Film Office 2011 Annual Report -- March 1, 2012'''&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

==== Public Act 291 of 2011 ====

In March 2011, [[Rick Snyder#Governor of Michigan|Governor Rick Snyder]]([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) announced plans to put a $25 million cap on the [[Michigan Film Incentive]], which at 42%, was one of the most aggressive film incentives in the United States. [[CNN]] reported that agreements signed prior to the cap proposal would be honored and that there were 43 pending applications on file at the [[Michigan Film Office]]. [[John E. Nixon]], [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] and [[Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget]] claimed that the Governor was not opposed to efforts to attract the film industry, but was concerned about uncapped and unfunded expenditures. "Nixon says that every dollar spent brings in only 28 cents, not enough to justify such a high tax incentive."&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Public Act 291 of 2011 (Section 125.2029h), was signed into Michigan law, effective immediately, on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=IncentiveReduced/&gt;  The new law honored existing production approvals with the following conditions stated in the Michigan Film Office 2011 Annual Report. Pre-production must begin within 90 days of approval, projects must have a signed agreement to participate and funds spent prior to obtaining a signed agreement do not qualify; additionally, budget increases must be approved by the Film Office and the Treasury to qualify for the incentive.  An audit with an independent Michigan CPA is required to obtain a post-production certificate, which is then submitted with the production's Michigan Business Tax return.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; Eligible projects are motion pictures, documentaries, television series, miniseries, interactive television, music videos, interactive games, video games, Internet programming, sound recording, ditital animation and interactive websites. Criteria for incentive approval are listed as follows:&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

# The production is financially viable.
# Utilization of existing infrastructure (studios, post-production facilities, equipment rental, etc.).
# The number and wage levels of direct jobs for Michigan residents created by a production.
# Ability to show Michigan in a positive light and promote the state as a tourist destination.
# Magnitude of estimated expenditures in Michigan.

Act 291 did not provide separate funding for infrastructure and workforce development for 2012 and no business tax credits were claimed in these categories for 2011; in the Michigan Film Office 2011 report, the Office was unclear on any discretion regarding funding infrastructure and workforce development expenditures within the $25 million annual cap.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; paragraph 3, of Section 125.2029h, does not mention infrastructure and workforce development.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Section 125.2029h (13) The film and digital media production assistance program shall provide for all of the following:
::(a) Funding shall be provided only to reimburse direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, crew personnel expenditures, or qualified personnel expenditures.

::(b) To be eligible to apply for funding, the eligible production company shall have direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, or a combination of direct production expenditures and Michigan personnel expenditures, of $100,000.00 or more.

Act 291 also specifically disqualifies commercials, televised news, weather reports, financial reports, political and fund-raising events, employee training and productions containing obscene matter from the incentive.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Negotiations with the legislature provided $50 million for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14 (S.B. 194), reduces the film incentive from $50 million to $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

===== Results of reduction in funding =====

In March 2011, the Michigan Film Office reported to [[CNNMoney.com]] that 43 pending applications could not be addressed until the legislature reached a final decision. Michigan Movie Magazine's, Chris Aliapoulios said, "As these applications sit in limbo, the projects involved are seeking out new locations..." &lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

In its 2011 publication, the Michigan Film Office reported that 24 of 85 project applications were approved, 15 of those projects wrapped in 2011, 2 remained in production and 7 were in pre-production and scheduled to shoot in 2012. Eight additional projects that began in 2010, 2011 expenditures for these projects are included in the 2011 report.  Twenty-five projects spent an estimated $201,968,238 in Michigan and were awarded $75,650,154.  These productions created 3350 jobs, or an equivalent of 766 full-time employment.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

==== Film incentive controversy ====

Opposed to the Michigan Film Incentive was the Center for Public Policy, which claimed that employment growth was too modest for the amount of money the state was spending.&lt;ref name=Huffpo/&gt; Governor Snyder has stated, "One of the problems with the tax credit world is that you're picking winners and losers, and government is not really competent to do that." &lt;ref name="Winners and Losers"/&gt;

Proponents of the film incentive, cited a multiplier effect,&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; whereby the simple act of money changing hands creates excise tax income, investment and consumer optimism.  A commissioned report, authored by [[Ernst &amp; Young]], found that 2,631 film industry jobs had been created in 2009 and 3,860 jobs in 2010. Ernst &amp; Young also found that economic activity was increased 6 to 1 for every incentive dollar spent.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Economist David Zin, states that the film incentives have had a positive impact on the private sector, but also interjects that five years of employment growth, projected by [[Michigan State University]], would only replace 8.1% of the jobs lost in Michigan between May and June 2008.&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; David Zin, closes his 34-page issue paper on film incentives with, "As with other types of incentives and credits, whether the relationship of costs to benefits is acceptable is a decision for individual policy-makers." &lt;ref name=Zin/&gt;

Alexander Martin, an economist, writes to the State of Michigan House Tax Policy Committee Chair, Judson S. Gilbert II, warning the committee of a "[[race to the bottom]]" economic condition, concerning subsidies that are geared toward increasing market share. Martin describes a scenario where the film industry may induce states with film incentives to bid against each other for film production business. Additionally, individuals, corporations and municipalities may make investments in an industry that can disappear when another State raises their film incentive. As proof, he offer the situation where [[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]] was contemplating laying off its fire department largely because Unity Studios relocated to Detroit.&lt;ref name="Martin Testimony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Layoffs"/&gt;

== Features ==
There are several methodologies for indexing:&lt;ref name="software"/&gt;
* [[Index (publishing)#Embedded indexing|Embedded indexing]] includes the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.
* '''Tagging''' allow indexing codes to be embedded in the text after the indexing is complete. The indexer inserts numbered dummy tags in the files, and then builds the index separately
* Most [[Word processor]]s have integrated automated indexing functions. These tools build a concordance or word lists from processed files. They have often limited usage.

== List of tools ==
The most well-known indexing tools are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indexers.org.uk/files/publications/Indexing%20Software%20programs%20v2.pdf |title=DEDICATED INDEXING SOFTWARE: WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU |publisher=indexers.org |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]

The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.
Surface-charge lithography, in fact [[Plasma desorption mass spectrometry]] can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Vespini | first2 = V. | last3 = Ferraro | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 13262–13265 | doi = 10.1021/la803046j | pmid=18986187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Dickinson''' (born 1950, [[Durham, England|Durham]]) is an English artist known for his work in Turkey, who works with political and satirical [[collage]]s. In 2008, he was prosecuted for a collage of the Turkish prime minister, but acquitted.&lt;ref name=tait&gt;Tait, Robert.

Retrieved 26 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the international [[art movement]] [[Stuckism]].&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

==Life and work==
Michael Dickinson was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, and spent most of his early years in [[Kuwait]], where his father was an employee of the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] and where he attended the Anglo-American School.&lt;ref name=timessatire&gt;Alberge, Dalya and Erdem, Suna (2006).

===Collage banned by Tripod===

In May 2005, Dickinson's web site, "The Carnival of Chaos", was blanked and he was informed by the host Tripod (a member of the [[Lycos]] group), "You are no longer an authorized member of Tripod. You have been removed because your web site violated our Terms of Service."&lt;ref name=banned&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Index.html "The Carnival of Chaos banned"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after he had posted a collage, ''Tyrant's Pants'', showing President Bush in his underpants with a cruise missile coming out of his rear and a [[swastika]] on his right buttock.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

[[File:Tyrant's-Pants.jpg|thumb|upright|''Tyrant's Pants'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing President Bush]]

===Turkish court case===

In June 2006, [[Istanbul]] police removed one of Dickinson's collages from a show in the city organised by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; Dickinson states that he hung his work in the show unknown to the organisers.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton&gt;Birch, Nicholas.

"It’s such an Alice in Wonderland feeling. The law is so absurd ... This law exists in Turkey about insulting 'Turkishness' or the State. You’re not allowed to state your opinion."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt;

In September 2006, Dickinson attended the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of the Global Peace and Justice Coalition show, charged with insulting behaviour for exhibiting Dickinson's work. The prosecutor described Dickinson as "ill-intentioned", but declined to bring a case because of "lack of evidence".&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; Hasan Gungor of the Istanbul-based group,  Initiative for Freedom of Speech, attributed this to fear of international news, when the [[European Union]] has concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt;

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Good Boy.jpg|thumb|''Good Boy'' by Michael Dickinson. He was prosecuted for its display.]]
Members of Global Peace and Justic Coalition remonstrated with Dickinson for distracting attention from their anti-[[Iraq War]] cause, and he then held up another collage showing Erdogan as a dog with a lead of the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]; he was arrested and charged with insulting the Turkish prime minister's dignity&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; with a trial date scheduled for October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Oliver.

On 25 September 2008, he was acquitted of any crime, the judge ruling that although there were "some insulting elements" in his collage, it fell "within the limits of criticism".&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; The case has favourable implications for Turkey's relationship with the [[European Union]], which had called for an improvement of its human rights record.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; Dickinson said, "I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions."&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

In June 2009, Dickinson fled Turkey for his native country, Britain, after learning that his acquittal had been overturned. Unable to find work, he returned to Istanbul soon after. In January 2010, a Turkish court convicted Dickinson of mocking the Turkish prime minister and levied a fine.   Refusing to pay the fine as a matter of principle, Dickinson faces up to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

Dickinson's application for a residence permit was refused due to his 2010 conviction, but he remained in the country after the expiry of his tourist visa. He was arrested in October 2013 for shouting [[Gezi Park]]-related slogans at police, and detained after his expired visa was discovered. He was deported after some days (and banned from returning for five years), choosing to go to Barcelona rather than his native Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickinson, ''CounterPunch'', 1 November 2013, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/01/tossed-out-of-turkey-after-twenty-seven-years/ Tossed Out Of Turkey After Twenty Seven Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoon Sallaert - Mythological Scene with Apollo, Fame, and the Muses.jpg|thumb|330px|''Mythological scene with Apollo, Fame, and the Muses'' by [[Antoine Sallaert]]]]

'''Monotyping''' is a type of [[printmaking]] made by [[drawing]] or [[painting]] on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or [[matrix (printing)|matrix]], was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to [[acrylic glass]].  The image is then transferred onto a sheet of [[paper]] by pressing the two together, usually using a [[printing-press]]. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using [[brush]]es or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior.
These prints from the original plate are called "ghost prints." A print made by pressing a new print onto another surface, effectively making the print into a plate, is called a "cognate". [[Stencil]]s, [[watercolor]], [[solvent]]s, [[brushes]], and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes can be spontaneously executed and with no previous [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]].

==History==
[[Image:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione 002.jpg|thumb|left|Monotype by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, probably a second impression]]
There is still no certainty as to who was the inventor of the monotype process. The Italian artist [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] (1609–64) is often credited as being the first artist to produce monotypes.  He made brushed sketches intended as finished and final works of art.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to make monotypes in the mid 1640s, normally working from black to white, and produced over twenty surviving ones, over half of which are set at night.  It is believed that the Flemish artist [[Antoine Sallaert]] created his first monotypes in the early 1640s and is therefore to be regarded as the inventor of this printing process.  Both artists used the new technique in different ways.  Castiglione created most of his monotypes as black-field images by wiping away ink on a prepared plate thus producing white and grey lines.  Sallaert, on the other hand, brushed bold, tapering lines onto the printing surface with meticulous precision.  It is likely that Sallaert's monotype style was influenced by the [[chiaroscuro]] woodcuts of the Dutch engraver [[Hendrik Goltzius]].  Sallaert found in the monotype a technique which was the closest to drawing and oil sketching. His monotypes and drawings are characterised by swelling lines and tapering ends.  He often added by hand white highlights to his monotypes.&lt;ref name=todd&gt;Todd D. Weyman, ''Two Early Monotypes by Sallaert'', in: Print Quarterly Vol. 12, No. 2 (JUNE 1995), p. 164-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Royalton Kisch, ''A Monotype by Sallaert'', in: Print Quarterly, 1988, V, n. 1, p. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;  Sallaert clearly appreciated in the monotype technique the freedom to design on a plate before printing it on paper.&lt;ref name=clev&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/about/press/media-kit/cleveland-museum-art-presents-monotypes-painterly-prints Kelley Notaro, ''An Exhibition of the Finest Monotypes from the Cleveland Museum of Art's Collection''] at The Cleveland Museum of Art site&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy G plate 11.jpg|thumb|''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'', a combination by Blake of [[relief etching]] for the lines and monotype for the colour]]
[[William Blake]] developed a different technique, painting on [[millboard]] in [[egg tempera]] to produce both new works and coloured impressions of his prints and book illustrations, including his [[Pity (William Blake)|''Pity'']].  Each impression was usually then worked over by hand, using ink and watercolour.  Few other artists used the technique until [[Degas]], who made several, often working on them further after printing ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070224100213/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true  Beside the Sea, 1876-7]); [[Pissarro]] also made several.   [[Paul Gauguin]] used a variant technique involving tracing, later taken up by [[Paul Klee]]. In the twentieth century the technique became more popular, such as the extraordinary colorful monotypes created by Marc Chagall in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Marc Chagall Monotypes'', Gerald Cramer, Editor, Geneva 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing monotypes to monoprints==
Historically, the terms ''monotype'' and ''[[Monoprinting|monoprint]]'' were often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Singular impressions: the monotype in America. Joann Moser. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, they have come to refer to two different, though similar, types of printmaking. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotypes, the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Additionally, the term monotype is often used for an image made by inking a non-absorbent surface with a solid colour, laying over it a piece of paper and drawing onto the back of the paper. When the paper is pulled off the resulting print consists of the line surrounded by ink picked up from the inked plate. The result has a chance element, often random and irregular which gives the print a certain charm, a technique famously used by British artist [[Tracey Emin]], a graduate of the Royal College of Art, where the practice of monoprinting in general was regarded as "fake painting".

Monoprints, on the other hand, now refers to the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate—lines, textures—that persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

'''Henry Nelson Goodman''' (7 August 1906 – 25 November 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], known for his work on [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]], [[mereology]], the [[problem of induction]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|irrealism]], and [[aesthetics]].

==Life and career==
Goodman was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of Sarah Elizabeth (née Woodbury) and Henry Lewis Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Roth, Christina J. Moose, Rowena Wildin (eds.), ''World Philosophers and Their Works: Freud, Sigmund – Oakeshott, Michael'', Salem Press, 2000, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[Jewish]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cohnitz &amp; Marcus Rossberg, ''Nelson Goodman'', Routledge (2014), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Harvard University]], [[A.B.]], [[magna cum laude]] (1928). During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, while studying for a Harvard Ph.D. in [[philosophy]], which he completed in 1941.&lt;ref name="Harvard Obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | title=Goodman Dies | work=Harvard University Gazette | accessdate=18 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614040257/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | archivedate=14 June 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards [[aesthetics]], where he became better known than in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. During [[World War II]], he served as a psychologist in the [[United States Army|US Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard. 2000. ''Project Zero: Nelson Goodman's Legacy in Arts Education''. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (58)3, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1946–1964, where his students included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Sydney Morgenbesser]], [[Stephen Stich]], and [[Hilary Putnam]]. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at several universities from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.

In 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H., and Perkins, D. "The Mark of Zero: Project Zero’s Identity Revealed." ''HGSE Alumni Bulletin'', December 1994, '''39'''(1), 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman died in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], Massachusetts.

==Philosophical work==
===Induction and "grue"===
In his book ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'', Goodman introduced the "[[new riddle of induction]]", so-called by analogy with [[David Hume|Hume]]'s classical [[problem of induction]]. He accepted Hume's observation that [[inductive reasoning]] (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons). How then can we differentiate between regularities or [[hypotheses]] that construe law-like statements from those that are [[contingent]] or based upon accidental generality?

[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[confirmation theory]] argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and [[evidence]] statements, which apply to only one thing.  Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate [[Grue and bleen|grue]], which applies to all things examined before a certain time ''t'' just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time ''t''. If we examine emeralds before time ''t'' and find that emerald ''a'' is green, emerald ''b'' is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds ''a, b, c,''..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are [[Grue and bleen|grue]].  Thus, before time ''t'', the apparently law-like statements "All emeralds are green" and "All emeralds are grue" are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously "All emeralds are grue" is not a law-like statement.

Goodman's example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial [[dilemma]] that "anything can confirm anything".

===Nominalism and mereology===
Goodman, along with [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]], is the founder of the contemporary variant of [[nominalism]], which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with [[set theory]]. Goodman's nominalism was driven purely by [[ontology|ontological]] considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with  [[W. V. O. Quine]], Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with [[set theory]] – discredited as sole [[foundations of mathematics]] as of 1913 ([[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'').

The program of [[David Hilbert]] to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1936 by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]].  Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, 
Quine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman's Penn colleague [[Richard Milton Martin]] argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward.

According to [[Thomas Tymoczko]]'s ''afterword'' in ''New directions in the philosophy of mathematics'', Quine had "urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation", putting the "key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context."  In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]] were merged into [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empiricism]]:  the emphasis of [[mathematical practice]] as effectively part of the [[scientific method]], an emphasis on method over result.

The Goodman–Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of [[mereology]]. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman's 1951 ''The Structure of Appearance'', a revision and extension of his Ph.D. thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his Ph.D. thesis still did).&lt;ref&gt;Cohnitz and Rossberg (2003), ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed.  Mereology is accordingly "ontologically neutral" and retains some of Quine's pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as [[American Pragmatism]]).

A main principle of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]], with products such as source code, [[blueprint]]s, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code.

''Open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify [[copyright]], [[License|licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues.

Generally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which supports community projects such as the open-source framework [[Apache Hadoop]] and the open-source [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP]].

==History==
{{main|History of free and open-source software}}The sharing of technical information predates the [[Internet]] and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline-engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].&lt;ref name="carculture"&gt;{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-262-56015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.

In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; By the time the US entered [[World War II]], 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt;

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.&lt;ref name="autogenerated172"&gt;{{cite book|title=IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|last=Fisher|first=Franklin M.|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063059-0|pages=172–9|author2=James W.

This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. [[Linux]] followed in this model.

=== Open source as a term ===
The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the [[free software movement]] who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;f=false |website=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain.

[...] Since everybody has access to source code, many routines have not only been used but dramatically improved by other programmers."'' |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group included [[Christine Peterson]], [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting&lt;ref name=osihistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=19 September 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001164015/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php |archivedate=1 October 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="rmsdissent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref name="Muffatto000"&gt;{{cite book  | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach  | first = Moreno  | last = Muffatto  | publisher = Imperial College Press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 978-1-86094-665-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he founded The [[Open Source Initiative]] in collaboration with [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;

The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit |website=Linux Gazette |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2015-02-07 |first=Guido |last=van Rossum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229053622/http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]], and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit /&gt;

"Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

==Economics==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
Some economists agree that open-source is an [[information good]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|publisher=E. Elgar|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85898-967-9|location=Cheltenham, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "knowledge good" with original work involving a significant amount of time, money, and effort. The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]]—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized as effectively a "[[consumers' cooperative]]", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] host websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.

Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, ''[[Open-Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab]]: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs'', Elsevier, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/02/02/3d-printed-open-hardware-syringe-pump-value-800m/ 3D Printed Open Hardware Syringe Yields $800M Value, Study Finds]- ''3D Printing Industry'' 2-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of [[open-source hardware]] design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. [[RepRap]] 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the [[peer production]] community.

===Licensing alternatives===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Smart phones.jpg|thumb|125px|Google Android operating system]] --&gt;
Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

*[[File:Wikipedia-logo-en-big.png|thumb|125px|Wikipedia is an example of a global application of the open source model.]]Creation for its own sake – For example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content for recreation. Artists have a drive to create. Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations – used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Patron – For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement. Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Freemium]] – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (potentially using a [[dual license]]).
* Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation. They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs. Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

==Open-source applications==
[[File:121212 2 OpenSwissKnife.png|thumb|Open-source model application domains]]
Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the [[open-source movement]] have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The [[open-source movement]] has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] and [[CAMBIA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' — Cambia — Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238–243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement.

An example of this application is the use of open-source 3D printers like the [[RepRap]] to manufacture appropriate technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.M. Pearce |author2=C.

* [[Open-source learning|Teaching]] – which involves applying the concepts of open source to instruction using a shared web space as a platform to improve upon learning, organizational, and management challenges.

==Society and culture==
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}
The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.&lt;ref name="copyright1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date = December 1998|author = US Copyright Office |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open source software development – Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&amp;date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

{{further|Open-source software movement}}

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.
* The [[South Korean government]] wants to increase its use of free and open-source software, in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions. It plans to make open standards a requirement, to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers. Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using open-source software distributions.&lt;ref&gt;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/south-korean-government-switch-open-source&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the [[Association of Internet Researchers|AoIR]] Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term "open-source Hinduism" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Kearney |title=Anatheism: Returning to God After God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRiTJ_6JFYYC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14789-7 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'', a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open-source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, 29 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Open-source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

On 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the [[TAACCCT|TAACCCT program]], which is described as "the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT".&lt;ref&gt;http://openeducation2013.sched.org/event/23553161b01967fd7ff58eea22ce24b2#.U_qxw2Mpft8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.

These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network — Open Source Pharmaceuticals — New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By definition, a medicinal product has a "well-established use" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319051530/http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork|date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&amp;D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse|publisher=Eclipse.org|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaunity.org |title=Open Source Yoga Unity — Home |publisher=Yogaunity.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russian music composer, scientist and [[Russian Pirate Party]] member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera "2032"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argonov.ru/2032.html |title=Техно-опера "2032: Легенда о несбывшемся грядущем" |publisher=Argonov.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under free license [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY-NC 3.0]]. This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label [[MC Entertainment]] as a commercial product, but then the author changed its status to free. In his blog [http://argonov.livejournal.com] he said that he decided to open raw files (including wav, midi and other used formats) to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against [[SOPA]] and [[Personal Information Protection Act|PIPA]]. Several Internet resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muznews.rockzvuk.com/news/pervaja_v_mire_muzykalnaja_opera_s_otkrytymi_iskhodnikami/2012-01-25-202 |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками — 25 Января 2012 — Новости музыки и шоубизнеса |publisher=Muznews.rockzvuk.com |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/7294092 |title=Музыкальная опера "2032" становится opensource — Talks — Форум|publisher=Linux.org.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netskop.ru/kulmztura/news_2012-01-19-16-40-02-974.html |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками |publisher=Netskop.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "2032" the first open-source musical opera in history.

=== Ideologically-related movements ===
The [[open access|open-access movement]] is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement. Members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with “future research, assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes.” The Open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials&lt;ref name="ref_a4"&gt;Harnad, S.

'''Panmela Castro''' (born 26 June 1981), also known as '''Anarkia Boladona''', is a [[Brazil]]ian artist who utilizes [[graffiti]] as a platform to raise awareness on [[Women's rights in Brazil|women's rights]] and the prevalence of [[Domestic violence in Brazil|domestic violence]] occurring to women in Brazil. In the year 2006, Brazil had passed a landmark law, called the [[Lei Maria da Penha|Maria da Penha Law]].&lt;ref name=vitalvoices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitalvoices.org/vital-voices-women/featured-voices/panmela-castro|title=Panmela Castro|publisher=Vital Voices|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law recognized that physical abuse towards women should be illegal and violates human rights. Women in Brazil did not know that this law existed. Panmela Castro recognized this, and decided to spread this law through graffiti art. She hoped that through her art, women in Brazil would know that they have rights, and that there is legal protection for women.

==Background==
Panmela Castro was born and raised in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]. At a young age, she was raised in a family where domestic violence occurred often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heloísa Passos|url=http://www.focusforwardfilms.com/films/67/panmela-castro|title=Panmela Castro|publisher=Focus Forward Project|date=2012|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She witnessed her mom and aunt being victims to domestic violence. Castro eventually became a victim of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creating4change.com/panmela-castro.html|title=Panmela Castro|publisher=Creating4Change|date=2014|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panmela Castro received a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from the [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes|School of Fine Arts]] at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. She is currently enrolled as a student in the Master of Arts Program at [[Rio de Janeiro State University]].&lt;ref name=vitalvoices/&gt;

==Style==
Panmela Castro believed that she could use graffiti as her canvas in the urban landscape to explore the women body and shed light on gender inequality, women submission, and domestic violence towards women. Panmela Castro uses her art form to condemn domestic violence.

==Cultural impact and accomplishments==
Panmela Castro has been nominated as one of the 150 women that have shaken the world by ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2012/03/08/women-in-the-world-150-fearless-women-photos.html#slide_20|title = Women in the World: 150 Women Fearless Women (Photos)|work = The Daily Beast|date= March 8, 2012|accessdate= February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro has been acknowledged worldwide through her efforts to advocate women's rights.

Panmela Castro formed Rede Nami, an urban network where female urban artist raises awareness on gender inequality through public art, graffiti, and workshops in Rio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alyse Nelson|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/04/panmela-castro-saving-lives-through-graffiti.html|title=Panmela Castro: Saving Lives Through Graffiti|work=The Daily Beast|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate= February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rede Nami also provides workshops in Brazil for women and girls, teaching them about domestic violence and teaching them about graffiti art.

==Awards==
In March 2010 Panmela Castro was awarded [[The DVF Awards|The DVF Award]] for being an extraordinary women fighting for change for women's rights.

In 2013, she was listed as one of the [[World Economic Forum]]'s [[Young Global Leaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/YGL13/WEF_YGL13_Honourees.pdf |title= List of 2013 Young Global Leaders Honourees |publisher= Weforum.org |page=4|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 115 inner wings.jpg|189px|thumb|right|This is diptych known as ''Paradise and Hell''.]]

'''''Paradise and Hell''''' is the left and right panels of a minor [[diptych]] by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] based on ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''. The image is oil on panel and is 135 x 45&amp;nbsp;cm. It was painted c. 1510 and is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]. Paradise is depicted darker than in the Haywain, which possibly represents the darkness of [[original sin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Description==
The left panel depicts Creation and the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is loosely divided into sections, beginning at the top and ending at the bottom, while the right panel does not appear to follow any sequence of events. The left panel most likely corresponds with the Book of Genesis, and follows from the top, moving downward, and the right panel possibly corresponds with the [[Book of Revelation]]. At the top of the left panel, [[God]] sits enthroned in [[Heaven]] while the world is created. [[Angel]]s toss the [[fallen angel]]s out of the Heaven. While the fallen angels are thrown out of Heaven, they turn to insects. Moving downward, in the next 'section', a scene is shown where God has created [[Eve]] and is introducing her to [[Adam]]. In the third 'section', the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] offers Adam and Eve a fruit from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], and Adam is reaching out to take it. At the bottom of the panel, an angel expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, thus marking the Fall of Man, and the two become ashamed of their nakedness. The right panel depicts the consequences of Adam and Eve's choice, in which a vision of hell is shown. A burning building can be seen in the background, and in the foreground, there appear to be several demons constructing a fortress or castle. To the lower left, a man is being directed towards a castle by two mutated animals. Just in front of the portcullis is a man riding a cow, being pierced by a sword or spear. At the bottom right, a man is running while being attacked by demonic creatures, while to the lower left a man is being devoured by a large human-legged fish.

'''''Public Sale''''' is a 1943 painting by the American artist [[Andrew Wyeth]]. It shows two men by a car and in the distance a crowd of people outside a farm building. The event depicted is the forced auction of a farm after the farmer's wife had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/2006/93.html?page=2|title=Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting belongs to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] since 2000. As of 2016, it is currently not on view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/93576.html|title=Public Sale|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Ken Johnson (art critic)|Ken Johnson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' singled the painting out as unusual in Wyeth's oeuvre because it "evinces social consciousness", something that otherwise is absent from the artist's works and makes him different from his contemporary [[Norman Rockwell]]. Johnson, reviewing a Wyeth exhibition in 2006, likened ''Public Sale'' to "an understated [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ken|date=April 18, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/18/arts/design/18wyet.html|title='Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Red Hot Catholic Love'''" is the 87th episode of the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on July 3, 2002. It was selected No. 2 on the "10 South Parks that Changed the World" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|title=The 'South Park' Episodes that Changed the World|author=Elena Gorgan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612151952/http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also part of "South Park's Dirty Dozen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletterarchive.org/2007/06/13/173395-South+Park+Booster+Club+Newsletter+-+The+Dirty+Dozen The Dirty Dozen] South Park Club Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Father Maxi travels to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to confront the growing problem of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic priests molesting children]]. Meanwhile, Cartman discovers that it is possible to defecate from the mouth.

==Plot==
The parents of South Park are a bit concerned when [[List of recurring South Park characters#Father Maxi|Father Maxi]] informs them about the Young Men's Catholic Retreat and agree that they do not want their kids to go. They also decide to have a [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]] talk to the boys to find out if the priest had been [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] them. The counselor, assuming the children were molested, asks, "Did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?" Having never been abused by Father Maxi, the boys are completely baffled about the question's meaning. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has a "brilliant" idea, reasoning she meant it could be possible that eating food through the rectum can cause defecation through the mouth. The other boys (especially [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]) think it is stupid and disgusting, and Cartman bets him $20 it will work. While the counselor is questioning the boys, all the parents decide to become [[atheism|atheists]], as the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual molestation scandals]] have destroyed their faith in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[God]].

Cartman ultimately does defecate out of his mouth, winning the bet and continually boasts the fact to Kyle, who becomes increasingly angered by it. News of this spreads, and it is concluded nationwide that this method of eating is much healthier than the traditional method (with the surgeon general basing that on "absolutely nothing"). The adults of South Park immediately adopt the new method of eating, calling it ''interorectogestion'' and even start passing trash cans around at social situations to openly collect the waste (literally "spewing crap from their mouths"), completely disregarding the previously long-held custom that defecation should occur in private. 

Meanwhile, Maxi has gathered a meeting of Catholic priests in Colorado to discuss the problem of child molestation. Maxi is appalled by such behavior and wants it to cease entirely, but to Maxi's horror, all of the other priests there have molested their altar boys. Maxi decides he has to go to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]]. Once there, he quickly finds the same: priests from all over the world (and from other worlds, specifically an alien race known as the Gelgameks) are molesting children and claim [[Catholic sex abuse cases#Celibacy theory|they need to continue the practice to receive gratification]]. They claim the "Holy Document of Vatican Law" does not prohibit the behavior, so Maxi wants to change the canon law to outlaw sodomy, as well as to [[clerical marriage|allow sex with women]]. The Cardinal tells him that the Document cannot be changed as no one knows where it is. Maxi decides to try to find it. Meanwhile, Kyle has lost his patience with Cartman's incessant boasting and tells Cartman that he accepts the fact that he beat him fairly. This angers Cartman, as he wanted to hold the victorious bet over Kyle's head indefinitely.

Maxi searches through the lower levels of the Vatican, and goes through a gauntlet in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' in order to reach the Holy Document. But the [[Pope John Paul II|Pope]] says they must first consult the highest power. He summons the "Queen Spider", which has for centuries been responsible for the pedophilia in the church, and declares that the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed. Angered by this, Maxi finally snaps and tears the Document in two, and [[St. Peter's Basilica|the building]] begins to crumble. Maxi stands in front of the ruins, and tells everyone that Catholicism is not about the Holy Document of Vatican Law, molestation, or Queen Spiders, but about being a good person. He says by clouding the moral lessons of the [[Bible]] with needless ceremony and so many literal translations, the Vatican has caused people to reject religion and argues that "when they have no mythology to live their lives by, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths". The parents, watching this on TV, regain their faith in God, deciding to stop shoving food up their rectum and to start going to church again, wanting to owe God an apology.

==Production==
In the DVD commentary for this episode, [[Matt Stone|Stone]] and Parker refer to their irritation towards arguments from more socially liberal/atheistic/secular minded types of people, as well as from socially religious conservatives.  The scene where the parents discuss atheism while crapping out their mouths is based on Parker's annoyance with atheists. When Maxi searches for the Holy Document the scene is animated in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' Randy's nightmare about the priest molesting the boys is done using footage from [[The Love Boat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: "Red Hot Catholic Love" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Queen Spider was taken from "[[Planet of the Spiders]]: Part One", a 1974 episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and is later referenced in the 2017 [[Role-playing video game]] ''[[South Park: The Fractured but Whole]]''.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W. R. Burnett]]'s novel, ''Goodbye to the Past'' (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David (April 2006). ''The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K. (2007). ''Seoul Searching: Culture and Identity in Contemporary Korean Cinema''. [[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S. I Love You'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Roman mosaic''' is a [[mosaic]] made during the [[Roman History|Roman]] period, throughout the [[Roman Republic]] and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Mosaics were used in a variety of private and public buildings.{{sfn|Bertoldi|2011}} They were highly influenced by earlier and contemporary [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Greek art|Greek]] mosaics, and often included famous figures from history and mythology, such as [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Alexander Mosaic]]. A large proportion of surviving examples come from Italian sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], as well as other areas of the [[Borders of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]].

==Development==

[[File:Pompeii - Cave Canem (4786638740).jpg|thumb|A Roman [[mosaic]] inscribed with the [[History of Latin|Latin phrase]] ''cave canem'' ("[[beware of the dog]]"), from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy, 2nd century BC]]

The earliest examples of Roman [[mosaic]] flooring date to the late [[Roman Republic|Republican period]] (2nd century BC) and are housed in [[Delos]], Greece. Witts claims that [[Tessera|tessellated]] pavements, using [[tesserae]], were used in Europe from the late fifth to early fourth centuries BC.{{sfn|Witts|2005}} This is contradicted by Ruth Westgate, who contends that the earliest tessellated mosaics of the [[Hellenistic period]] date to the 3rd century BC, with the 2nd to early 1st-century BC [[mosaics of Delos]] constituting roughly half of the known examples.{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-256}} Hetty Joyce and Katherine M. D. Dunbabin concur with this assessment, asserting that the transition from [[pebble]] mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics originated in Hellenistic-[[Greek Sicily]] during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as [[Morgantina]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|p=260}}{{sfnp|Dunbabin|1979|p=265}} The earliest known pebble mosaics and use of [[Chipseal|chip pavement]] are found at [[Olynthus]] in Greece's [[Chalcidice]], dated to the 5th to 4th centuries BC, while other examples can be found at [[Pella]], capital of [[Macedon]], dated to the 4th century BC.{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|pp=259-260}}{{sfnp|Dunbabin|1979|p=265}}

The earliest mosaics of Roman [[Pompeii]], dated to the [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian First Style]] of wall painting in the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BC, were clearly derived from the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek model]].{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-275}} However, they contained far more figured scenes on average, less abstract design, the absence of [[lead]] strips, as well as an almost complete lack of complex, three-dimensional scenes utilizing [[polychromy]] until the [[Roman wall painting (200 BC–AD 79)|Pompeian Second Style]] of wall painting (80-20 BC).{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|pp=253-254, 257-258}}{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-275}} The mosaics in the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] (c. 300 AD) from [[Roman Sicily]] perhaps represent the hallmark of mosaic art in the [[Late antiquity|Late Imperial period]]. The mosaic decoration of the local palace complex culminates in the gallery, which contains a scene of animal hunting and fighting covering an area of {{convert|3200| sqft| m2|-2}}.&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_hinton_st_mary_mosaic.aspx |title=The Hinton St Mary Mosaic |publisher=British Museum |date=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Alexander Mosaic]] from Pompeii, ca. 100 BC]]

==Technology==
Roman mosaics are constructed from geometrical blocks called [[tessera]]e,{{sfn|Dunbabin|2006|p=280}} placed together to create the shapes of figures, motifs and patterns.{{sfn|Witts|2005}} Materials for tesserae were obtained from local sources of natural stone, with the additions of cut brick, tile and pottery creating coloured shades of, predominantly, blue, black, red, white and yellow.{{sfn|Witts|2005}} Polychrome patterns were most common, but [[monochrome]] examples are known.{{sfn|Packard|1980}} Marble and glass were occasionally used as tesserae,{{sfn|Ricciardi|Colomban| Tournié| Macchiarola| Ayed|2009}} as were small pebbles,{{sfn|Donaldson|1965}} and precious metals like [[gold]].{{sfn|Neri| Verità| 2013}} Mosaic decoration was not just confined to floors but featured on walls and vaults as well. Traces of guidelines have been found beneath some mosaics, either scored into or painted onto the mortar bedding. The design might also be pegged out in string,{{sfn|Witts|2005}} or mounted in a wooden frame.{{sfn|Oliver|2001}}

The collapse of buildings in antiquity can, paradoxically, both irrevocably destroy mosaics or protect and preserve them.{{sfn|Witts|2005}}

==Imagery==
[[File:05-Mosaico del Oecus. Aquiles en Skyros alta.jpg|thumb|[[Achilles]] being adored by [[Achilles on Skyros|princesses of Skyros]], a scene from the ''[[Iliad]]'' where [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses) discovers him dressed as a woman and hiding among the princesses at the royal court of Skyros. A late Roman [[mosaic]] from [[La Olmeda]], Spain, 4th-5th centuries AD]]
As well as geometric patterns and designs, Roman mosaics frequently depicted divine characters or mythological scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tufts.edu/programs/mma/fah189/2005/arcaro/EarlyyP.html |title=Physical Aspects of the Polytheistic Roman Style |publisher=Tufts University |date=2005 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mozaico.net/roman-mosaics-ancient-art/ |title=Roman Mosaic Discoveries Made Through Time |publisher=Mozaico |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=13 March 2015 |author=C., Rawan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraits===
Imagery of famous individuals or entertaining scenes are common on Roman mosaics. The [[Alexander Mosaic]] from the [[House of the Faun]], [[Pompeii]] depicts the [[Battle of Issus]] between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/alexander/06.shtml |title=Alexander the Great - The Battle of Issus (334) |publisher=History of Western Civilization, Boise State University |accessdate=13 March 2015 |author=Knox, E.L. Skip |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325111858/http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/alexander/06.shtml |archivedate=25 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to famous people from antiquity, mosaics can depict aspects of daily life. The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] from [[Rome]] depicts a fighting scene, naming each gladiator involved. A gladiatorial scene is also known from [[Leptis Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SciTech/News/Roman-mosaic-found-in-Libya-20050613 |title=Roman mosaic found in Libya |publisher=News24 |date=14 June 2005 |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
One of the earliest depictions of [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Roman Christianity]] is [[Hinton St Mary Mosaic|a mosaic from Hinton St Mary]] (in [[Dorset]], [[England]]) which shows [[Christ]] with a [[Chi-Rho]] behind his head. The mosaic is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="RM" /&gt;  [[Orpheus mosaics]], which often include many animals drawn by the god's playing, are very common; he was also used in [[Early Christian art]] as a symbol for [[Christ]].  Scenes of [[Dionysus]] are another common subject.

===Emblems===
Progression within the mosaic technique developed the emblem, the "heart" of all mosaics. The word emblem is used to describe a small mosaic featuring a little genre scene or still life, characterised by particularly thin tesserae made separately and mounted in a central or important position in the main panel.

==Notable examples==
*The [[Alexander Mosaic]] from the [[House of the Faun]], [[Pompeii]].
*The [[Tomb of the Julii]] in the [[Vatican Necropolis]], beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Rome]].
*The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] from the [[Via Casilina]] outside [[Rome]].
*The [[Zliten Mosaic]] from [[Zliten]] in [[Libya]].

The '''Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa''' is the life-size [[sarcophagus]] of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] noblewoman dating from between 150–140 BC. Since 1887, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=466847&amp;partId=1&amp;people=94909&amp;peoA=94909-1-5&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The brightly painted sarcophagus of the Etruscan [[aristocratic]] woman Seianti was discovered in 1886 at Poggio Cantarello near [[Chiusi]] in [[Tuscany]] and was subsequently sold, along with its contents (a skeleton and some grave belongings), to the British Museum. A similar sarcophagus is in the collections of the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Florence]]. Known as the Sarchophagus of Larthia Seianti, the two women were probably from the same dynastic family in ancient Chiusi.

==Description==
The sarcophagus is a [[masterpiece]] of Etruscan artwork. The deceased woman's name is inscribed in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] along the base of the chest.  She must have belonged to one of the richest families of [[Chiusi]], as Seianti is dressed sumptuously for the occasion, wearing an ornate gown and cloak, with complicated drapery falling sinuously over her body, and adorned with a [[tiara]], earrings, bracelets and a necklace. Seianti has been depicted as a mature lady, who gestures to adjust her veil, realistically revealing parts of her body in the process. She leans against a pillow and holds a mirror in her other hand, gazing into the distance.

==Scientific analysis==
Scientific analysis of the bones and teeth that were deposited in the chest indicated that Seianti probably died at about 50–55 years of age. The rather idealised face of the deceased woman depicted on the sarcophagus, which was typical of [[Etruscan art]] at the time, can be compared with an accurate and less flattering reconstruction of her face in the museum, based on the features of the deceased woman's skull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">The '''Swedish National Archive of Recorded Sound and Moving Images''', in Swedish ''Statens ljud- och bildarkiv'', SLBA, was founded in 1979 (originally having the name ''Arkivet för ljud och bild,'' ALB) with the aim of collecting and preserving all film and recorded sound produced in [[Sweden]], including radio and television programs. The archive was an independent institution under the Ministry of Education, Research and Culture (utbildnings - och kulturdepartementet). It was located in [[Stockholm]] and employed 65 people. The last director general was Sven Allerstrand.

A national deposit law requires publishers to submit a copy of all new titles to the archive. The older collections are gradually built from donations and acquisitions, but suffer from the institution's youth. Other major sound and film archives in Sweden exist among private collectors and the national public broadcasting company [[Sveriges Radio]].

In April 2008, the Swedish government asked the [[National Library of Sweden]] to investigate and prepare for a merger between SLBA and the library by January 1, 2009.

== Migration ==
SLBA performed a mass-digitizing on parts of its collections, primarily focusing on public service material. Over a three-year period, an initial selection of 1.5 million hours of material were to be digitized and made available to researchers.

Most of the digitization process was automated. At full speed, 200 tapes per day, or 2,800 hours, were digitized by a staff of just five people. A number of relatively unconventional methods were being used, including the high-speed transfer of open-reel audiotapes, robotic automation of cassette-based audio and video transfer, and a suite of custom scripts that process the digitized files automatically.

The infrastructure includes a migration asset management system developed inhouse that handles such things as communication with production systems, logistics (of both original carriers and resultant files), and metadata input and transfer. Once the digitization process is completed, automatic functions create new carrier database records, insert metadata, direct the new archive and browsing files to their final mass storage locations, and link files to the MARC based database for direct access.

[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking from an instable equilibrium.svg|thumb|A ball is initially located at the top of the central hill (C). This position is an unstable equilibrium: a very small perturbation will cause it to fall to one of the two stable wells left (L) or (R). Even if the hill is symmetric and there is no reason for the ball to fall on either side, the observed final state is not symmetric.]]

In [[physics]], '''symmetry breaking''' is a [[phenomenon]] in which (infinitesimally) small [[Quantum fluctuation|fluctuation]]s acting on a [[system]] crossing a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or "[[Thermal noise|noise]]"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] "breaking", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but [[randomness|disorderly]] [[Quantum state|state]] into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is thought to play a major role in [[pattern formation]].

In 1972, [[Nobel prize in physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Philip Warren Anderson|P.W. Anderson]] used the idea of symmetry breaking to show some of the drawbacks of [[reductionism]] in his paper titled "More is different" in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=P.W. | title=More is Different | journal=Science | volume=177 | issue=4047| pages=393–396 | year=1972 | url=http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf | doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393 | pmid=17796623 | format=|bibcode = 1972Sci...177..393A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symmetry breaking can be distinguished into two types, [[explicit symmetry breaking]] and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], characterized by whether the equations of motion fail to be invariant or the [[Vacuum state|ground state]] fails to be invariant.

==Explicit symmetry breaking==

{{main|Explicit symmetry breaking}}

In explicit symmetry breaking, the [[equations of motion]] describing a system are variant under the broken symmetry.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking==

{{main|Spontaneous symmetry breaking}}

In spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[equations of motion]] of the system are invariant, but the system is not because the background ([[spacetime]]) of the system, its [[Vacuum state|vacuum]], is non-invariant. Such a symmetry breaking is parametrized by an [[order parameter]]. A special case of this type of symmetry breaking is [[dynamical symmetry breaking]].

== Examples ==

Symmetry breaking can cover any of the following scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars5/astroinfo/gloss/s.html|title=Astronomical Glossary|author=|date=|website=www.angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The breaking of an exact symmetry of the underlying laws of physics by the random formation of some structure; 
:* A situation in physics in which a [[ground state|minimal energy state]] has less symmetry than the system itself; 
:* Situations where the actual state of the system does not reflect the underlying symmetries of the dynamics because the manifestly symmetric state is unstable (stability is gained at the cost of [[local property|local]] asymmetry); 
:* Situations where the equations of a theory may have certain symmetries, though their solutions may not (the symmetries are "hidden").

One of the first cases of broken symmetry discussed in the physics literature is related to the form taken by a uniformly rotating body of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] in [[gravitational]] and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jacobi | first=C.G.J. | title=Über die figur des gleichgewichts | journal=[[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] | issue=33| pages=229–238 | year=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon later [[Liouville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Liouville | first=J. | title=Sur la figure d'une masse fluide homogène, en équilibre et douée d'un mouvement de rotation| journal=Journal de l'École Polytechnique | issue=14| pages=289–296 | year=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1834, discussed the fact that a tri-axial ellipsoid was an equilibrium solution for this problem when the kinetic energy compared to the gravitational energy of the rotating body exceeded a certain critical value. The axial symmetry presented by the McLaurin spheroids is broken at this bifurcation point. Furthermore, above this bifurcation point, and for constant angular momentum, the solutions that minimize the kinetic energy are the ''non''-axially symmetric [[Jacobi ellipsoid]]s instead of the [[Maclaurin spheroid]]s.

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s '''Symphony No. 1''' in [[C major]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 21, was dedicated to Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]], an early patron of the composer. The piece was published in 1801 by [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister|Hoffmeister &amp; Kühnel]] of Leipzig. It is not known exactly when Beethoven finished writing this work, but sketches of the finale were found to be from 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies |last=Grove |first=George |year=1896 |publisher=Novello and Company, Limited |location=London |pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The [[symphony]] is clearly indebted to Beethoven's predecessors, particularly his teacher [[Joseph Haydn]] as well as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], but nonetheless has characteristics that mark it uniquely as Beethoven's work, notably the frequent use of ''[[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes|sforzandi]]'' and the prominent, more independent use of wind instruments. Sketches for the finale are found among the exercises Beethoven wrote while studying [[counterpoint]] under [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger]] in the spring of 1797.

The premiere took place on 2 April 1800 at the [[Burgtheater#History|K.K. Hoftheater nächst der Burg]] in Vienna. Most sources agree that the concert program also included Beethoven's [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] as well as a symphony by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], but there is some disagreement as to whether the remainder of the program included excerpts from Haydn's oratorio ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' or from ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' and whether Beethoven's own [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|No. 2]] was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/593218/Beethovens_Symphony_No._1_in_C_Major_Op._21_Historical_Theoretical_and_Performance_Interpretations Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21: Historical, Theoretical and Performance Interpretations] Nicholas Alexander Brown, Brandeis University, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.classiccat.net/beethoven_l_van/21.info.php Beethoven opus 21 Symphony No. 1 in C Major] classiccat.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classical-music.com/article/beethoven-what-did-19th-century-think Beethoven: What did the 19th century think?] Barry Cooper, classical-music.com, October 27 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This concert effectively served to announce Beethoven's talents to Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edmund. ''Beethoven The Universal Composer''. New York: HarperCollins, 2005, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following instrumentation
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
;[[Woodwind]]:

:2 [[Flute]]s
:2 [[Oboe]]s
:2 [[Clarinet]]s in C
:2 [[Bassoon]]s

The clarinet parts are commonly played on B{{music|flat}} clarinet, as C and D clarinets are no longer widely used. However, there is some controversy over whether they should be played on E{{music|flat}} instruments instead. The E{{music|flat}} clarinet's timbre is much closer to that of the C and D clarinets than that of the warmer-sounding B{{music|flat}} clarinet.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, Norman. "Anatomy of the Orchestra". University of California Press, 1987, p. 146-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The second flute is not used in the second movement.

==Description and analysis==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
The beginning of the twelve-[[Bar (music)|bar]] ''introduction'' of the first movement is sometimes considered a "musical joke". For example, the English musicologist [[Donald Tovey]] has called this work "a comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;Woodstra, Chris et al. (2005) All music guide to classical music: the definitive guide to classical music&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Symphony No. 1 can be regarded as a result of Beethoven's bold musical experimentation and advancement which he presents five years after [[Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|last symphony]] and twelve years after [[Mozart]]'s final ''[[Jupiter Symphony]]'': Unusually, Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 starts with a sequence of repeatedly accentuated [[Dominant (music)|dominant]]–[[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord sequence]]s, however, in the "wrong" key and untouching and leading away from the tonic, so that the listener only gradually realizes the real key (or home key) of the symphony.

In correlation to the tradition, however, the first movement is composed exemplarily in [[sonata form]]. Here, as a new element, Beethoven uses the more lyrical [[second subject]] to display and intertwine the woodwind with the string instruments. The [[Musical development|development]] is elaborate and mainly based on the [[first subject]] of the movement and explores a long [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] progression (starting from [[A major]], reaching [[F-flat major|F{{music|flat}} major]], passing F major at the end); it also refines the juxtaposition and combination of the orchestral instruments (woodwinds and strings); the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] is almost coherent with the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]]; the [[coda (music)|coda]] reminisces the [[motive (music)|motivic]] work of the development before it closes the movement with strongly repeated chords played by the whole orchestra.

Due to Beethoven's [[metronome]] markings and the addition of the indication of ''con moto'' ("with motion"), the ''Andante'' (in F major, the [[subdominant]] of the symphony's [[Tonic (music)|home key]]) of the second movement is played considerably faster than the general concept of that tempo. In contrast to the tradition, Beethoven uses the entire instrumentation of the orchestra (2nd flute [[tacet]]) and, consequently, displays a vast spectrum of sound in this movement which, as well, is composed in sonata form.

The third movement is on the one hand remarkable, because, although it is indicated as ''Menuetto'', it is marked ''Allegro molto e vivace'' and, consequently, to be played so fast that it is essentially a ''[[Scherzo]]'' – a description mostly used after Beethoven's first symphony. Secondly, as an inherent element of the ''scherzo'', it does not customarily display new melodies or motives, but instead uses the [[musical scale]]s and [[Triad (music)|triads]] from the first movement as motivic material which render this movement's momentum and wit.

The finale opens with another introduction consisting only of scale fragments played slowly by the first violins alone (an unusual effect) beginning on G and gradually adding more notes. After finally reaching an F, outlining a [[dominant seventh chord]] in C major, the real start of the finale ''Allegro molto e vivace'' begins in C major with a theme similar (both in rhythm and character) to the 4th movement of [[Symphony No. 88 (Haydn)|Haydn's Symphony No. 88 in G major]]. Composed again in a solid sonata form, Beethoven uses the scale as the prevailing motivic element in this movement which, by character, pays most of all tribute to the customary finale established by Haydn in the preceding decades.

The musical form is in accordance with the established composing tradition. Musical content, instrumentation as well as tempi, is unusual, if not revolutionary, in its use for a symphonic work of Beethoven's time. Therefore, Beethoven introduced himself with this work uniquely and boldly as an advancing symphonic composer and stood true to this statement throughout his compositional life.

== Education ==
Terry Fenton was born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] in 1940, and studied at Regina College's School of Fine Art (now [[University of Regina]]) from 1958-1960, with [[Ronald Bloore]], [[Roy Kiyooka]], and [[Arthur McKay]]. Moving to the Saskatoon campus to study English literature, Fenton earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962. Along with studies at the University of Regina (1965-1966), Fenton attended [[Emma Lake Artist's Workshops]] in Saskatchewan with [[John Cage]] and [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1965, [[Frank Stella]] in 1967, and Michael Steiner in 1969.&lt;ref name="SNAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sknac.ca/index.php?page=ArtistDetail&amp;id=307|title=Saskatchewan NAC Artists - Terry Fenton|first=|last=Squareflo.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugeramathesongallery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Terry-Fenton-Bio-2014.pdf Bugera Matheson Gallery, Terry Fenton: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painting ==
The imagery in Terry Fenton's paintings is often focused on the large skies and wide open prairies of his home province. In Fenton's own words, "''Because of their apparent lack of scenery, the open prairies haven't been much painted by anyone. Even painters who've flourished in Saskatchewan have preferred the river valleys in the plains or the aspen parkland and forest to the north and east. While I admire and have absorbed much from them, I'm drawn south and west to the grasslands, partly because I was born and raised in Regina, but especially because the colour and light there is so luminous.''"&lt;ref name="SNAC" /&gt; Fenton's paintings can be found in a number of collections, including the [[University of Lethbridge]], Alberta; the [[MacKenzie Art Gallery]], Regina; the [[Art Gallery of Greater Victoria]], British Columbia; and the Canada Council Art Bank, Ottawa.&lt;ref name="TFCV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/cv.html|title=Terry Fenton Curriculum Vitae|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/fenton_terry.html|title=Terry Fenton Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Terry Fenton's writing on art has touched on subjects both historical and contemporary, from essays on [[Fayum mummy portraits]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/fayuum.html Terry Fenton, ''"PRE-PICTURES? Roman Portraits from FAYUUM"'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[St. Francis in Ecstasy (Bellini)|St. Francis in Ecstasy]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/bellini.html Terry Fenton, ''"St. Francis in Ecstasy"'']&lt;/ref&gt; to articles on [[Morris Louis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Terry Fenton, ''"Morris Louis"'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adolph Gottlieb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/gottlieb.html Terry Fenton, ''"Adolph Gottlieb"'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Fenton has written a number of books, including monographs on [[Dorothy Knowles]], [[Reta Cowley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiospress.com/books/detail/land-marks-the-art-of-dorothy-knowles|title=Hagios Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Kenneth Noland]], as well as his 2009 treatise on pictorial art, "About Pictures."

The '''''Kitchen Maid''''' (in Spanish '''''La mulata''''', '''''La cocinera''''' or '''''Escena de cocina''''' (''Kitchen Scene'')) is one of two paired domestic paintings by [[Diego Velázquez|Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez]] from his early [[Seville]] period. A wide range of dates has been suggested for its completion, although most place it between 1620 and 1622. This version is kept in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The second version is held at the [[National Gallery of Ireland]].

José López-Rey suggests that this picture could be related to a lost Velázquez painting described by [[Antonio Palomino]]..."where a board is seen, that serves as a table, with a charcoal burner, and a pot boiling on top, and covered with a bowl, and the fire is visible, the flames, and the sparks are clearly visible, a small tin saucepan, an [[alcarraza]], some plates, and some basins, a glazed jug, a mortar with its pestle and a head of garlic next to it; and on the wall there is small basket and a cloth hanging from a hook, and other trinkets; and guarding this is a boy holding a jug, wearing a [[coif]], who with his humble clothes represents a subject that is very ridiculous and amusing".&lt;ref&gt;Palomino, page. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin version was bequeathed by [[Sir Alfred Beit, 2nd Baronet|Alfred Beit]] in 1987. A 1933 cleaning revealed a depiction of Jesus’ supper at [[Emmaus]] on the wall behind the main figure. 

The Chicago painting was bought from the [[Jacques Goudstikker|Goudstikker]] gallery in [[Amsterdam]] by August L. Mayer and presented to the Institute in 1927. It was at the time thought to be the Velázquez original, relegating the Beit painting to the status of a copy.  A number of art experts agreed with this opinion, including Bernardino Pantorba and José Gudiol, however, López-Rey recognized that the painting in Dublin came from the hand of Velázquez, casting doubt on the originality of the painting in Chicago due to its poor state of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;López-Rey, page. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Velázquez expert Jonathan Brown agreed with this reasoning, suggesting that the Chicago painting was “possibly” painted by Velázquez. In addition, he also suggested that the picture might be a copy produced by an artist who «wanted to draw on the success of genre paintings by Velázquez and who might have produced a large number of replicas and versions of the originals».&lt;ref&gt;Brown, page. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kitchen Maid'' was restored in 1999 by Frank Zuccari. Despite paint losses, the best conserved parts show a similar quality, and in some aspects a superior quality, to the Dublin version. No trace has been found suggesting that the painting might have at any time had any religious significance or that it is anything other than a painting of a mulatto maid working in a kitchen.  The painting contains a number of features that confirm its technical superiority over the Dublin version. In the Chicago version there are a greater number of folds on the upper part of the girl’s coif and the treatment of the associated light and shadows is more meticulous, this is also seen in the crumpled cloth in the foreground. Superior technique is also seen in the depiction of light on the objects, particularly on the glazed ceramic jug that the maid is holding in her hand, in which it is possible to see the shine of the crackle glaze and marks left when the jug was formed on a potter’s wheel. A possible explanation for this improvement in technique is that Velázquez returned to a previous theme in order to improve on it, concentrating on the tactile qualities of the painting, which were his main interest at the time, and disregarding the religious motif.&lt;ref&gt;Catálogo de la exposición ''De Herrera a Velázquez'' (Benito Navarrete Prieto), pages. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested influences for the painting include Flemish engravings by [[Jacob Matham]].&lt;ref&gt;Marías, page. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of the Supper at Emmaus in the Dublin version has led some authors to suggest a possible influence by [[Caravaggio]], although this is uncertain as it is difficult to establish whether works by the Italian painter or by his contemporaries could have reached Seville and for Velázquez to have been familiar with them.&lt;ref&gt;Catálogo de la exposición ''De Herrera a Velázquez'', op, cit. Entre quienes niegan la influencia de Caravaggio, Brown, page. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soiling of Old Glory.jpg|thumb|right|''The Soiling of Old Glory'', by Stanley Forman.]]
'''''The Soiling of Old Glory''''' is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]&amp;ndash;winning photograph taken by [[Stanley Forman]] during the [[Boston busing crisis]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{Cite web| work=Slate | title=The Soiling of Old Glory | last=Masur | first=Louis P. | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2188648/ | date=2008-04-10 | accessdate=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a white teenager, Joseph Rakes, assaulting a black man, lawyer and [[civil rights]] activist [[Ted Landsmark]], with a flagpole bearing the American flag (also known as [[Old Glory]]).

The image was taken for the ''[[Boston Herald American]]'' in [[Boston]] on April 5, 1976, during one in [[Boston busing desegregation|a series of protests]] against court-ordered [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]].&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; It ran on the front page of the ''Herald American'' the next day, and also appeared in several newspapers across the country.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; It won the [[1977 Pulitzer Prize]] for Spot Photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1977|title=The Pulitzer Prize Winners, 1977|accessdate=2008-04-12|work=The Pulitzer Prizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsmark was active in trying to get more minority contractors in the construction industry, but he hadn't been paying attention to the busing protests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Landsmark, "I had difficulty finding a parking space in downtown Boston, and I was running a few minutes late for the meeting in city hall. So I was in a hurry and perhaps not paying as much attention as I might have as I approached a corner, where the young demonstrators were coming in the other direction. I did not see them until both they and I were at that corner."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Life After Iconic Photo: Today's Parallels Of American Flag's Role In Racial Protest | url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/18/494442131/life-after-iconic-photo-todays-parallels-of-american-flags-role-in-racial-protes | accessdate=2016-09-18 | work=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakes was swinging the flag and trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Stars and Strife| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/indelible-apr06.html| access-date=2011-06-17 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910153911/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/indelible-apr06.html |archive-date=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing his glasses and suffering a broken nose, by the time the famous picture was taken.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web|last=Bayard|first=Louis|title=Flagging America’s racial divide|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/04/28/old_glory/|date=28 April 2008|work=Salon|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakes was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to two years imprisonment and two years probation. The jail sentence was suspended. In 1983 the Boston police issued a warrant alleging that Rakes had beaten to death the brother of his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="Boston Man Sought"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Man Sought on Murder Warrant|newspaper=The Day (New London, CT)|date=1 February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fled prosecution, but returned in 1988 after the murder charge was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ralph|first=James|title=The picture of hatred|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/chi-soilingbw19_dtapr19,0,2417168.story|accessdate=3 Dec 2016|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152547/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/chi-soilingbw19_dtapr19,0,2417168.story|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rakes carried the stigma of being known as "the flag kid", but eventually married and had children while laboring as a construction worker and later in hazardous waste.&lt;ref name=Salon /&gt;

'''Theorica''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Θεωρικά}}''') (also '''Theoric Fund''' and '''Festival Fund''') was in [[ancient Athens]] the name for the fund of monies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments of various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in the shape of largesses from the state.&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kennedy  | first = Charles Rann  | author-link = Charles Rann Kennedy  | contribution = Theorica  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume =   | pages = 1126–1127  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1133.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There were, according to [[Xenophon]], more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''De Rep. Ath.'' iii. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides those open to the whole body of the people, there were many confined to the members of each tribe, [[deme]], and house.  These last were provided for out of the private funds of the community who celebrated them.  At the most important of the public festivals, there were not only [[sacrifice]]s, but [[procession]]s, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic contests, and games, celebrated with great splendor and at a great expense.

Theorika was created or reinstated&lt;ref&gt;Some ancient sources cite [[Pericles]] as the founder of the theorika (Plutarch’s Pericles 9.1 and Plato’s Gorgias 515E); [[Agyrrhius|Agyrrhios]], an Athenian demagogue, is also mentioned as the first to have initiated this public largesse by Aristotle in ''Athenian Constitution'' 41.3.  See also Buchanan, James ''Theorika''.  New York 1962 (p. 29-53).&lt;/ref&gt; around 350 BCE, after the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War (357-5 BCE)]],&lt;ref&gt;Justin (6.9.1) dates the establishment of the theorika sometime at the end or after the battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Athenian statesman [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], an administrator to the theorikon treasury sometime after 354/3 until Cephisophon of Aphidna replaced him in 343/2, and Diophantus.  The Social War had plunged Athens into serious military and financial difficulties, thus creating an incentive to help the Athenian people by means of largesse.  It was established to provide enough money for poorer Athenian citizens to be able to purchase tickets for yearly festivals of public worship and theatrical productions, such as the [[Dionysia]], [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]], [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinia]] and [[Thargelia]]. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals, upon whom the burden of {{lang|grc|λειτουργία}} devolved; but a considerable, and perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public [[treasury]].  The religious embassies to [[Delos]] and other places, and especially those to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], [[Isthmian Games|Isthmian]], and [[Pythian Games]], drew largely upon public funds, though a part of the cost fell upon the wealthier citizens who conducted them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Antiquitates juris publici Graecorum'' p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of money contributed to this treasury varied between “15 [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm talents] or less and not much under 100 talents”.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. ''The Athenian Boule''. Oxford 1972: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an epitome (Dem. 1 hyp. 5) of [[Demosthenes]]’ [[Olynthiacs|''First Olynthiac'']], a scholar named [[Libanius]]&lt;ref&gt;Libanius’ explanation is accepted by some, but the information he provides is often questioned.  Edward M. Harris raises sound arguments for doubt in his book ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens'' (New York 2006):  “The road to historical error is often paved with good intentions.  Certainly no one had better intentions than the scholar Libanius…” (p. 121).&lt;/ref&gt;  explains that in Athens there were no stone seats (only wooden benches) at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]], and also originally no charge for admissions into the festival.  Due to the lack of seating available, fights would break out as everyone rushed to find a bench; the leaders of the community decided to charge an admissions fee of two [[Obolus|obols]] to prevent further violence.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"&gt;Blake, W. E. “New Literary Fragments on Demosthenes” Trans Proc Am Philol Assoc 57 (1926) p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was paid to the [[lessee]] of the theater (called {{lang|grc|Θεατρώνης}}, {{lang|grc|Θεατροπώλης}}, or {{lang|grc|ἀρχιτέκτων}}) who undertook to keep it in good repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of being allowed to receive the profits.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  But because poorer citizens could not afford to pay for admittance, Athens established a fund that covered the costs of their tickets.  Each citizen was allotted one [[drachma]] to cover the ticket cost of two obols (διωβελία) on each day of the three-day Dionysia.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"/&gt;   The payments would differ depending on the fluctuations of the state treasury and how many days the festivals lasted.

This payment continued to be exacted after the stone theater was built. [[Pericles]], to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive the price of admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"/&gt;

In time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides theatrical ones: the sum of two [[Obolus|obols]] being given to each citizen who attended; if the festival lasted two days, four obols; and if three, six obols ; but not beyond that. Hence all theoric largesses received the name of ''diobelia'' ({{lang|grc|διωβελία}}).  The sums thus given varied at different times, and of course depended on the state of the public treasury.  These distributions of money, like those of grain and flour, were called ''dianomai'' ({{lang|grc|διανομαί}}), or ''diadoseis'' ({{lang|grc|διαδόσεις}}).  They were often made at the [[Dionysia]], when the allies were present, and saw the surplus of their tribute distributed from the orchestra.  The appetite of the people for largesses grew by encouragement, stimulated from time to time by designing [[demagogue]]s; and in the time of [[Demosthenes]] they seem not to have been confined to the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Philip.'' iv. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  The German classical scholar [[Philipp August Böckh]] calculated that from 25 to 30 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] were spent upon them annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens'' p. 224, 2d ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Theoric Board ==

In the earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly appointed to manage the Theoric fund.  The money thus appropriated was disbursed by the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]''.  After the anarchy, the largess system having been restored by [[Agyrrhius]], a board of managers was appointed, possibly consisting of ten men, who were called by many names ({{lang|grc|ἀρχὴ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικῷ}}, {{lang|grc|οἱ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικὸν τεταγμέμοι}} or {{lang|grc|κεχειροτονημένοι}}, {{lang|grc|θεωρικὴ ἀρχὴ}} &amp;c.).  They were elected by show of hands at the period of the great [[Dionysia]], one from each tribe,  and served four-year terms.  In the time of Eubulus many other branches of the administration were placed under the control of this board; as the management of the civil expenditure, the office of the ''[[Apodektai]]'', the building of docks, [[arsenal]]s, streets, &amp;c.  This was dictated by an anxiety on the part of the people that no part of the revenue should be improperly diverted from the Theoric fund, which they thought would be prevented by increasing the powers of its managers.  But these extraordinary powers appear not to have been of long continuance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]], ''Against Ctesiphon'' 57, ed. Steph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, ''Hellen. Alt.'' vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 124—127, 1st ed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] explains:

“''All the officials concerned with civilian administration are appointed by lot, apart from the treasurer of the army fund (ταμίας στρατιωτικόν), the men in charge of the festival fund and the curator of the water supply; these are elected, and hold office from one [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]] to the next.''”  (Ath. Const. 43.1)

As public revenue greatly increased in the Athenian state, so too did the Theoric administration; according to Demosthenes there was an increase to as much as 400 talents a year from a previous amount of 130 talents (Phil. iv 37-8).  As a result of this growth the Theoric Board began to extend itself into a powerful position over other public works, activities and boards that were supervised by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|βουλή]] (Council of Five Hundred).  The boule had previously controlled the state revenue and the expenditures, as well as the appropriations of monies to the magistrates, with the help of the different boards: the poletai (Auctions Board) and the apodektai (Board of Receivers).&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford 1991: p. 253; see also Arist. ''Ath. Const.'' 47.2-48.1.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the Theoric administration rose in power and worked together with the boule, it put the administration in a position where “it must have had a fair chance of securing for itself the lion’s share of the appropriations and possibly supplementing this share by a surplus”.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. “The Theoric Fund and the graphe paranomon against Apollodorus” GBS XVII (1976): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;   The powerful position also enabled its board members to acquire confidential knowledge, information once only shared among those in the boule, on the activities of other departments.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. “Athenian Democracy After 403 BC” CJ 75.4 (April–May,1980): p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;   This weakened the monopoly of the boule and, as a result, the Theoric officials were able to gain supreme financial insight and replace the boule as the main resource of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes ''Ath. Boule'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;   Men seeking popularity in Athens recognized this growth of power and influence as a source of great opportunity, and eventually the Theoric Board eclipsed and absorbed all other financial offices.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 282.&lt;/ref&gt;   Utilizing this power, the Theoric Board proceeded to oversee the leasing of mines, the financing of expensive public works, such as roads and buildings, and money for the Athenian navy. [[Aeschines]] scornfully describes this new monopoly of power in his speech ''Against [[Ctesiphon (orator)|Ctesiphon]]'':

“''…they [the Theoric Board] also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.''” (3.25)

== Demosthenes, Philip II, and the Stratiotika ==

Before the theorika was established, the stratiotika (τὰ στρατιωτικά), or Military (Stratiotic) Fund, received any remaining surplus revenue if Athens was at war; this provided financing for military expenditures.  But immediately after the Social War, all surplus revenue was allotted to the theorika until Demosthenes fought to have it redirected back to the stratiotika in 339/8.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes was a strong proponent in the fight against the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and believed that all surplus monies should be used for military campaigns rather than for domestic public works; Eubulus, on the other hand, was very much against expensive foreign expeditions.  After the Social War Eubulus and his followers, the “peace party”, believed that the Athenian αρχή was no more, so they used the theorika to “restrain the [[Deme|demos]] from rash imperialistic adventures”&lt;ref&gt;Mader, Gottfried “Pax Duello Mixta: Demosthenes and the Rhetoric of War and Peace” CJ 101.1 (2005-6): p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to convince the people that peace was beneficial.  The theorika had become, in a sense, a psychological tool for this political party to repress the war mentality by exploiting the selfishness of the Athenians.  It was also a “crucial factor in the process of shaping and distorting perceptions”,&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; which might explain the denial of Philip as an immediate threat, and also why the Athenians were more thorough in their organizations of festivals than with their own military (Dem. Phil. i 35-6).  In the ''First Olynthiac'', delivered in 349 BCE, Demosthenes complains that Athens has the means to fight Philip but would rather use its money for pleasure:

“''Such are my views on the expeditionary force.  With regard to the supply of money, you have money, men of Athens; you have more than any other nation has for military purposes.  But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure.  Now if you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not, you have--or rather, you have no supply at all.  ‘What!’ someone will cry, ‘do you actually move to use this money for military purposes?’  Of course I do not.  Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service.  Your opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the money for your festivals.  Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or light, as circumstances demand.  Only money we must have, and without money nothing can be done that ought to be done.  There are other proposals before you for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while there is yet time, grapple with the problem.''” (19-20)

Meanwhile a protective law had been passed in Athens illegalizing proposals on the use of the money in the theorika, especially if the suggestions were contradictory to the purpose of the fund (merismos).  Demosthenes’ caution when approaching the topic of the theorika in the ''First Olynthiac'' proves that such a law was in existence.  Also during this time, in the face of either resisting Philip to retrieve their possessions or betraying their allies and losing them, their [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] and the [[Thracian Chersonese]], [[Apollodorus of Acharnae]] proposed in the boule (in which he was a member in 348 BCE) that the Athenian people should decide whether the surplus should be used for the theorika or the stratiotika  (Dem. 59.4 Against [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaera]]).  The vote was unanimous that the money should be used for the stratiotika against Philip, but, because this type of proposition was still illegal, Apollodorus found himself being indicted by Stephanos of Eroiadai, who drew up a [[graphe paranomon]] (γραφή παρανόμων) against him; he was ultimately fined one talent and his decree was made null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Trevett, Jeremy ''Apollodorus the Son of Paison''. Oxford 1992: p. 138-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Following this vote, Eubulus threatened death to anyone who tried to put the interests of the theorika below that of the stratiotika, making the act a capital offense.  After Apollodorus’ indictment and Eubulus’ new law, Demosthenes openly suggested in his ''Third Olynthiac'', a speech delivered in 349 BCE in lieu of Philip’s hostilities against [[Olynthus]], that the state get rid of the theorika because of its hampering effect upon their current crisis.  He also asked to eliminate military exemptions for those who ran the Dionysian festivals in Athens, as it was demoralizing for the men who wished to serve their country:

“''In plain language I mean the laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service regulations.  The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in consequence discourage those willing to serve.  When you have repealed these laws and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will propose what you all know to be salutary measures.  But until you have done this, do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit, only to be ruined by you for his pains.  You will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also make good advice more dangerous for the future.  Yes, men of Athens, and you ought to insist that those who made these laws should also repeal them.''”  (3.10-11)

The idea of demoralization is echoed by Libanius.  Instead of being paid wages&lt;ref&gt;Libanius is incorrect here; hoplites did not receive payment for their military services (Harris 121).&lt;/ref&gt; for serving in the army and enduring the dangers of warfare, Athenian citizens preferred to stay home and attend the religious festivals.  Eubulus posed an argument two years after the ''First Olynthiac'' that the Athenians had to accept peace with Philip (the [[Peace of Philocrates]], which Aeschines supported), otherwise they would have to go to the [[Pireus|Piraeus]], pay a war-tax (eisphora) to finance the fleet and transfer the money from the theorika to the stratiotika (Dem. On the False Embassy 19.291).  Eubulus had laid out the different options for the Athenians: they could accept peace with Philip or, if they chose to continue the war, they would have to support it using their own means of financing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. M. ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens''. Cambridge 2006: p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes’ goal, by criticizing the theorika, was to snap the Athenians out of their denial and mistaken beliefs so that they could recognize the “absurd contradiction between domestic priorities and external exigencies, between the comfortable illusion of peace and the growing crisis in the north.”&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the ''Fourth Philippic''&lt;ref&gt;Some modern scholars consider the Fourth Philippic to be inauthentic—otherwise it was probably delivered right after the Third Philippic in 341 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes’ attitude towards the theorika was changing:

“''Now there is also another matter, the misrepresentation of which by unfair obloquy and in intemperate language is injuring the State, and furthermore is affording a pretext for those who are unwilling to perform any of their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse.  I am really afraid to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; for I think I shall be able, with advantage to the State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the property-owners against the necessitous.  If we could banish from our midst both the obloquy which some heap upon the Theoric Fund, and also the fear that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole body politic.''” (4.35-37)

Demosthenes’ political party, the “war party”, had always “traditionally (especially in the great days of the Empire) been interventionist externally but ‘Athens-first’ internally.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. J. ''Theorika''. New York 1962: p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;   Seeing that the theorika was crucial to preserving social peace in Athens ([[Demades]], in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Mor. 1011b'', referred to it as the “glue of the democracy”), he needed to appeal to both worlds as an impartial arbiter.  In the ''Fourth Philippic'' he speaks on behalf of the poor in Athens, reminding the wealthy, who criticized the theorika at its inception, that when the public revenue did not exceed 130 talents a year they remained dutiful and paid their property taxes.  With the growth of revenue reaching 400 talents a year, the wealthy no longer felt the weight of financial responsibility upon their shoulders and it was of his opinion that the poor should be able to profit from the increase as well (Phil. iv 37-9).

In 339 BCE the situation in Athens became much more alarming than in 348 when Philip had attacked Olynthus and its allies, a matter Athens (excluding Demosthenes) did not consider an immediate threat. In 339 Philip had seized [[Elateia]] in [[Phocis]], which was a closer and more serious danger to Athens.  Demosthenes did not have any trouble persuading the Assembly to allocate all the public funds to the stratiotika and Philochorus, in a fragment preserved by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (ad Ammaeus 1.11), further illustrates Demosthenes’ success:

“''The people, after listening to the letter [a letter of allegations Philip made against the Athenians] and to the exhortations of Demosthenes, who advocated war and framed the necessary resolutions, passed a resolution to demolish the column erected to record the treaty of peace and alliance with Philip, and further to man a fleet and in every other way to prosecute the war energetically.''”

== The Diminishment of the Theorika ==

The fact that Demosthenes did not face charges for breaking Eubulus’ law suggests that he was able to have the law repealed sometime around 339.  In the year 337/6 Demosthenes became the head of the theorika and donated 10,000 drachmas of his own money (Aesch. 3.24) while revenues were being funneled to the stratiotika; but his donations lasted only one year.  Upon the reinstitution of the theorika he attempted, through private gifts and a large festival, to make up for the privileges the Athenians had lost after adopting his financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Blake p. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly after Demosthenes’ promotion the Theoric Board was weakened by the law of Hegemon, which prohibited men from holding offices for more than four years; before this law, Theoric officials could be elected over and over again in successive terms.  Hegemon was a member of the opposition party along with Aeschines and Demades, and it is difficult to determine a political reason behind his law other than it was “an intended slap at Demosthenes”.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 72-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] had also become a rival for the boule’s control over finances and climbed the ladder of power until he assumed jurisdiction over the state’s treasury in 337/6 as the Controller of Finances (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως), which the Theoric Board had previously monopolized.  He governed this seat for twelve consecutive years until 326/5 when his and Demosthenes’ rival, [[Menesaechmus|Menesaichmus]], took over the position.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its diminishment of powers, the Theoric Board existed in some way or another up until Aristotle’s ''Athenian Constitution'' (326-323 BCE).  Lycurgus was using most of the state’s income to pay for its defense, building projects, and religious festivals, which maintained some sense of the theorika’s continuation in Athens.  One of the last references to the theorika involved Demades’ notorious attempt at bribing the Athenians.  In 331 [[Agis III|King Agis III]] of Sparta persuaded Athens to join him in Sparta’s revolt against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].  The Athenians begged [[Demades]], who was then a member of the Theoric Board, to grant money to be used towards the deployment of [[trireme]]s to aid in the rebellion.  His response, as recorded in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Morals'' (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae 818 E-F), was:

“''You have money, for I have made provision for the Festival of the Pitchers that each of you receive a [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm half-mina]; but if you prefer to use the money for this enterprise, use your own money for the Festival.''”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 80. (His translation)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demades’ bribery successfully kept the Athenians from taking up arms against Alexander.

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

==Women in male roles==
[[File:Eugénie Fiocre as a matador.jpg|thumb|180 px|The ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]] as a [[matador]] circa 1860]]
With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wanderers Of Time''''' is a collection of five science fiction short stories by [[John Wyndham]], published in [[Coronet Books]] in 1973. The stories were early works, originally published in magazines in the 1930s and written under the name of John Beynon.

==Contents==
* "'''Before the Triffids'''"
:An introduction by [[Walter Gillings]], a UK editor and journalist active in Science fiction [[fandom]] since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/gillings_walter Authors : Gillings, Walter : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia] Retrieved 2013-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

:In 1941, Roy Sabre's girlfriend Betty mysteriously disappears. Ten years later he has constructed a time-machine and his first trip is to go back to find her. But his arrival is observed and his machine attacked and damaged as it departs; instead of returning to 1951, it travels to the far future where mankind has disappeared and the Earth is under the control of machines controlled by insects. Roy finds that several other time-travellers, due to damage and malfunction, have been cast forward to the same time...
* "'''Derelict of Space'''" (''Fantasy, Number 3'', 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?61766 Bibliography: Derelict of Space] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:The salvage of the ''Excelsis'', a spaceship reported lost 50 years earlier, ends in disaster when it breaks free of the magnetic hawsers attaching it to the space-tug ''Dido'' and, instead of splashing down in the North Atlantic, it impacts a German town with great loss of life on the ground. The captain and crew of the ''Dido'' are arrested and the German authorities demand their extradition to answer accusations that they stole the wreck's valuable cargo and hid it on the moon before deliberately crashing the hull as part of an anti-[[Nazi]] plot...
* "'''Child of Power'''" (''Fantasy, Number 3'', 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?190566 Bibliography: Child of Power] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:During a discussion on the next step in human evolution a doctor reveals that one of his patients, the son of a quarryman in [[Derbyshire]], was born 'electro-sentient' - that is, he was able to directly sense electromagnetic radiation, able to tune in to radio programs and diagnose problems with electrical equipment. The doctor expands on the opportunities and problems this presented  both the boy and his unimaginative working-class family, especially when the boy reveals he can also sense unknown languages emanating from outer space...
* "'''The Last Lunarians'''" (''Wonder Stories'', April 1934 as "The Moon Devils"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?78625 Bibliography: The Moon Devils] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:Due to a mechanical problem, the ''Scintilla'' is forced to land on the edge of the [[Sea of Serenity]] whilst performing a survey for the Lunar Archaeological Society, and discovers an entrance to what appears to be an underground tomb for members of the extinct Lunarian race. But, the assumption that it is just a tomb proves tragically wrong; the Lunarians are woken from their slumber and determine to use the ''Scintilla'' to escape their dead world...
* "'''The [[Puff-ball]] Menace'''" (''Wonder Stories'', October 1933 as "Spheres of Hell"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?97456 Bibliography: Spheres of Hell] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:The leaders of Ghangistan resolve that they cannot hope to defeat the West using conventional warfare and must seek an alternative. In [[Cornwall]] and west [[Devon]], hundreds of keen gardeners are contacted individually to perform a field trial of a new plant. The seeds grow rapidly into bulbous fungi, feet across but weighing only a pound or so. Rashes break out in people nearby and there are several deaths but, by the time a causal link to prematurely ruptured fungi is suspected it is too late - the puff-balls are nearing maturity, ready to spread their deadly spores, and a storm approaching from the west threatens to blow, not only the spores but also the puff-balls themselves, across the whole of southern England...
