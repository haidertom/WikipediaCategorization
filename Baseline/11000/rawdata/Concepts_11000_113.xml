'''Absolute space and time''' is a concept in physics and philosophy about the properties of the universe. In physics, absolute space and time may be a [[preferred frame]].

==Before Newton==
A version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame{{clarify|date=August 2018|Reason=What is a preferred frame?}}) can be seen in [[Aristotelian physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/#2 Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. Westman]] writes that a "whiff" of absolute space can be observed in [[Copernicus]]' classic work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Westman, ''The Copernican Achievement'', University of California Press, 1975, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018|reason=How is absolute spacetime illustrated by an immobile sphere of stars, and what does that mean anyway? (I know but I doubt the average reader does.) What "whiff" of absolute spacetime in De Revolutionibus? General reader (even one who knows generally about ''De revolutionibus'', and immobile spheres of stars) needs a less allusive explanation, or rather less comparing, and more clear, specific language.}}

==Newton==
Originally introduced by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;In ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time.

{{quote|Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies: and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space ...

Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into another: and relative motion, the translation from one relative place into another ...|Isaac Newton}}

These notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute [[Rest (physics)|rest]], or moving at some absolute [[speed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/ Space and Time: Inertial Frames (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in [[absolute rotation]] about their center of gravity ([[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]]) by observing the tension in the rope.

Absolute time and space continue to be used in [[classical mechanics]], but modern formulations by authors such as [[Walter Noll]] and [[Clifford Truesdell]] go beyond the [[linear algebra]] of [[elastic moduli]] to use [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]] for non-linear [[Field theory (physics)|field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Truesdell (1977) ''A First Course in Rational Continuum Mechanics'', [[Academic Press]] {{ISBN|0-12-701301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differing views==
[[Image:Rotating spheres.svg|thumb|200px|Two spheres orbiting around an axis. The spheres are distant enough for their effects on each other to be ignored, and they are held together by a rope. The rope is under tension if the bodies are rotating relative to absolute space according to [[Rotating spheres|Newton]], or because they rotate relative to the universe itself according to [[Mach's principle|Mach]], or because they rotate relative to local [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] according to [[general relativity]].]]
Historically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies.&lt;ref name="Ferraro"&gt;{{citation|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]] suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity,&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book |title=The Matter Myth: Dramatic Discoveries that Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality |author= Paul Davies |author2= John Gribbin |page= 70 |isbn=0-7432-9091-7 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlmEIGiZ0g4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=universe+Milky++rotation#PPA70,M1   }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example later raised by [[Albert Einstein]] in his development of general relativity.

A more recent form of these objections was made by [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Mach's principle]] proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, [[mass]] is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton's examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Ernst Mach; as quoted by {{cite book |title=Gravitation and Inertia |author=Ignazio Ciufolini |author2=John Archibald Wheeler |pages=386‚Äì387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYIs1ndbi38C&amp;pg=RA1-PA386&amp;dq=centrifugal+Einstein+rotating+globes#PRA1-PA387,M1 |isbn=0-691-03323-4 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity ''in space'', our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to ''the entire universe''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Ernst Mach; as quoted by [[Ignazio Ciufolini|Ciufolini]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]]: ''Gravitation and Inertia'', p. 387&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These views opposing  absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce [[operational definition]]s for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity.

Even within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of [[inertial frame of reference]] has taken precedence, that is, [[preferred frame|a preferred ''set'' of frames of reference]] that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity]], leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojeviƒá:&lt;ref name="Blagojeviƒá2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation and Gauge Symmetries |author=Milutin Blagojeviƒá |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8JDSi_eNbwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=inertial+frame+%22absolute+space%22#PPA5,M1 |isbn=0-7503-0767-6 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of classical mechanics since, according to Galilean principle of relativity, none of the inertial frames can be singled out.
* Absolute space does not explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect to any one of the inertial frames.
* Absolute space acts on physical objects by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;Isaac Newton: ''Principia'', Corollary V, p. 88 in Andrew Motte translation. See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;{{cite book |author=C M√∏ller |title=The Theory of Relativity |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford UK |isbn=0-19-560539-X |date=1976 |page=1 |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/220221617&amp;referer=brief_results |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Inertial frame of reference]] for more discussion on this.

==Special relativity==
The concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of [[special relativity]] theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of [[spacetime]] in [[special relativity]], and curved spacetime in [[general relativity]].

Absolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a [[relativity of simultaneity]]. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference,&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|59}} which negates absolute simultaneity.

==Einstein==
{{Main article|Einstein's views on the aether}}
Quoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] with "properties of space", a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in [[general relativity]] the "aether" is not absolute anymore, as the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter.&lt;ref name=kostb&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|title=Albert Einstein's New Ether and his General Relativity|journal=Proceedings of the Conference of Applied Differential Geometry|pages=78‚Äì86|date=2001|url=http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802120105/http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|archivedate=2010-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view. For the mechanical behaviour of a corporeal system hovering freely in [[vacuum|empty space]] depends not only on relative positions (distances) and relative velocities, but also on its state of rotation, which physically may be taken as a characteristic not appertaining to the system in itself. In order to be able to look upon the rotation of the system, at least formally, as something real, Newton objectivises space. Since he classes his absolute space together with real things, for him rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real. Newton might no less well have called his absolute space ‚ÄúEther‚Äù; what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable [[acceleration]] or [[rotation]] to be looked upon as something real.|Albert Einstein, Ether and the Theory of Relativity (1920)&lt;ref name=einstb&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s:Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|Because it was no longer possible to speak, in any absolute sense, of simultaneous states at different locations in the aether, the aether became, as it were, four-dimensional, since there was no objective way of ordering its states by time alone. According to special relativity too, the aether was absolute, since its influence on inertia and the propagation of light was thought of as being itself independent of physical influence....The theory of relativity resolved this problem by establishing the behaviour of the electrically neutral point-mass by the law of the geodetic line, according to which inertial and gravitational effects are no longer considered as separate. In doing so, it attached characteristics to the aether which vary from point to point, determining the metric and the dynamic behaviour of material points, and determined, in their turn, by physical factors, namely the distribution of mass/energy. Thus the aether of general relativity differs from those of classical mechanics and special relativity in that it is not ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô but determined, in its locally variable characteristics, by ponderable matter.|Albert Einstein, √úber den √Ñther (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Einstein | date=1924 | title=[[wikilivres:√úber den √Ñther|√úber den √Ñther]] | journal=Verhandlungen der Schweizerischen naturforschenden Gesellschaft | volume=105|issue=2|pages=85‚Äì93}}.

==General relativity==
Special relativity eliminates absolute time (although G√∂del and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity)&lt;ref name="Savitt"&gt;{{citation|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven F.|title=There's No Time Like the Present (in Minkowski Spacetime)|doi=10.1086/392846|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=67|issue=S1|date=September 2000|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.6140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]].&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|207‚Äì223}} There appears to be absolute space in relation to the [[celestial sphere|distant stars]] because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system's physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode = 2004physics...9010G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AeroVironment Global Observer''' is a concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric [[geosynchronous]] satellite system with regional coverage.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/aerovironments-global-observer-flying-high-again-03902/ Defense Industry Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}}, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance. In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation at this altitude permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to {{convert|600|mi|km}} in diameter, equivalent to more than {{convert|280000|sqmi|km2}} of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

==Development==

===JCTD program===
The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program had the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the [[US military]] and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD demonstrated a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAS that could be transitioned for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  The program was a joint effort with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Department of Homeland Security]], and AeroVironment that started in September 2007, to culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provided for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program were:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS for a 5 - 7 day endurance for {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}} altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8&amp;nbsp;kW payload capacity. The system had to be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

*United States Special Operations Command
*United States Strategic Command
*U.S. Department of Homeland Security
*U.S. Air Force
*U.S. Army
*U.S. Coast Guard
*U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency

===Flight test partners===
*Air Force Flight Test Center
*NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

===Mission possibilities===
High-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, such as Global Observer, may enable several capabilities that enable rapid and effective actions or [[countermeasure]]s:
* '''Communications relay.'''  Durable, satellite-like, affordable communications relay with substantial bandwidth capacity can interconnect and route data in real time, enabling teams and command centers separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other.
* '''Disaster response.''' Hurricane, storm tracking and general weather monitoring may be useful in evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. Global Observer provides communication alternatives in the event of cell tower, microwave relay and satellite downlink failure.
* '''Maritime surveillance.''' Coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods can be subject to long-term surveillance. Analysts can observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats.

==History==

A Global Observer prototype, called "Odyssey," flew in May 2005.  It had a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, one-third the size of the planned full-sized version, and ran solely on hydrogen fuel-cells powering electric motors that drove eight propellers, flying the aircraft for several hours.  The JCTD started in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2005-11/aerovironment-global-observer AEROVIRONMENT GLOBAL OBERSVER] - Popsci.com, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/aerovironment-global-observer-long-endurance-uav-wing-load-tests/16022/ AeroVironment Global Observer long endurance UAS completes wing load tests] - Gizmag.com, 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Aerovironment announced that the full-sized Global Observer wing had passed wing load testing.  The 53&amp;nbsp;m (175&amp;nbsp;ft) all-composite wing, which comes in five sections and is designed to maximize wing strength while minimizing weight, had loads applied to it that approximated the maximum loads it is designed to withstand during normal flight, turbulence and maneuvers.  In its third year of testing, the demonstrator had also undergone ground and taxi tests as well as taken a "short hop" lifting off the ground briefly during taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing-346040/ Global Observer clears wing load testing] - Flightglobal.com, 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"/&gt;

The Global Observer performed its first flight on 5 August 2010, taking off from Edwards AFB and reaching an altitude of {{convert|4,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one hour.  The flight was performed using battery power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-first-flight/16049/ Global Observer successfully completes first flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;The aircraft completed initial flight testing, consisting of multiple low-altitude flights, at Edwards AFB in August and September 2010.  This phase used batteries to power the hybrid-electric aircraft and approximate full aircraft weight and center of gravity for flight control, performance, and responsiveness evaluation.  Following this, the program team installed and ground tested the aircraft's hydrogen-fueled generator and liquid hydrogen fuel tanks which will power it for up to a week in the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AeroVironment_Global_Observer_Stratospheric_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Completes_Initial_Flight_Testing_999.html AeroVironment Global Observer Stratospheric UAV Completes Initial Testing] - Spacedaily.com, 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the Global Observer using hydrogen fuel occurred on 11 January 2011, reaching an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-uav-first-hydrogen-powered-flight/17602/ Global Observer unmanned aircraft makes first hydrogen-powered flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2011, Global Observer-1 (GO-1), the first aircraft to be completed, crashed 18 hours into its 9th test flight.  AeroVironment said it was undergoing flight test envelope expansion and had been operating for nearly twice the endurance and at a higher altitude than previous flights when the crash occurred.  At the time, the second aircraft developed as part of the JCTD program was nearing completion at a company facility; the $140 million program was originally scheduled for completion in late 2011, but the crash delayed this by a year.  AeroVironment was looking for sources of incremental funding to provide a bridge between the demonstration and a future procurement program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-crash/18321/ Global Observer UAS crashes during flight-testing] - Gizmag.com, 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/aerovironment-global-observer-crash-rattles-observers-0 AeroVironment Global Observer Crash Rattles Observers] - Aviationweek.com, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Observer crashes during test flight |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/04/04/Global-Observer-crashes-during-test-flight/UPI-41741301921265/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |agency=United Press International|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Pentagon closed the development contract for the Global Observer, the reason being the crash in April 2011.  The Global Observer was used as a technology demonstration, not a program for a functioning aircraft.  In April 2013, the Pentagon stated that no service or defense agency had advocated for it to be a program.  AeroVironment is currently in possession of the second prototype Global Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/pentagon-global-observer/ No One Wants the Pentagon‚Äôs Gigantic Hydrogen-Powered Drone] Wired.com, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2014, AeroVironment announced that it had teamed with [[Lockheed Martin]] to sell the Global Observer to international customers.  The partnership is focused around building "atmospheric satellite systems" around the UAV.  The Global Observer may compete for orders with the [[Boeing]] [[Phantom Eye]] liquid hydrogen-powered long endurance UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aerovironment-teams-with-lockheed-martin-on-global-observer-395675/ AeroVironment teams with Lockheed Martin on Global Observer] - Flightglobal.com, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/2014-02-09/aerovironment-lockheed-martin-advance-global-observer-uas AeroVironment, Lockheed Martin Advance Global Observer UAS] - Ainonline.com, 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior analytics ==
Behavior informatics covers ''behavior analytics'' which focuses on analysis and learning of behavioral data.

== Behavior ==
From an informa[[Informatics|t]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ics perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of four key elements: actors (behavioral subjects and objects), operations (actions, activities) and interactions (relationships), and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector, all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior matrix.

[[File:Bellum omnium contra omnes.png|thumb|The ''Pr√¶fatio'' (Preface) of ''De Cive'' where the phrase ''bellum omnium contra omnes'' appears for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11-IA16&amp;dq=%22bellum+o-mnium+contra+omnes%22 See] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Taken from the revised edition printed in 1647 at Amsterdam (''apud L. Elzevirium'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ See] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''{{lang|la|Bellum omnium contra omnes}}''''', a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase meaning "the war of all against all", is the description that [[Thomas Hobbes]] gives to [[Human condition|human existence]] in the [[state of nature]] [[thought experiment]] that he conducts in ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642) and ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of "each against all" where war is rare and terms such as "competition" or "struggle" are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0425.html|title=Each Against All|author=[[Charles Fourier]]|editor=[[Upton Sinclair]]| year=1915|edition=1st |work=[[Bartleby.com]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobbes' use==
In [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] itself,&lt;ref name=Lv &gt;{{cite book|title=Leviathan |author=[[Thomas Hobbes]] |editor-first = Hermann |editor-last =Klenner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Meiner Verlag |location=[[Hamburg]] |year=2005 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;pg=610&amp;dq=%22a+warre,+as+is+of+every+man,+against+every+man%22+%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22+%22bellum+omnium+in+omnes%22+%22bellum+omnium+contra+omnes%22 610] |isbn=978-3-787-31699-1| id={{ISBN|3-78731699-X}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] speaks of 'warre of every one against every one',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Warre+of+every+one+against+every+one%22 Chapter 14].&lt;/ref&gt; of 'a war [...] of every man against every man'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Chapters 13-14].&lt;/ref&gt; and of 'a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour',&lt;ref name=Lv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22 Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin phrase occurs in ''[[De Cive]]'':
{{Quote|[...] ''ostendo primo conditionem hominum extra societatem civilem, quam conditionem appellare liceat statum natur√¶, aliam non esse quam bellum omnium contra omnes; atque in eo bello jus esse omnibus in omnia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22ostendo+primo+conditionem+hominum+extra+societatem+civilem,+quam+conditionem+appellare+liceat+statum+naturae,+aliam+non+esse+quam+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes+;+atque+in+eo+bello+jus+esse+omnibus+in+omnia%22 ''Pr√¶efatio'' ("Preface")].&lt;/ref&gt;

I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22I+demonstrate+in+the+first+place,+that+the+state+of+men+without+civil+society+(which+state+we+may+properly+call+the+state+of+nature)+is+nothing+else+but+a+mere+war+of+all+against+all;+and+in+that+war+all+men+have+equal+right+unto+all+things%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later on, two slightly modified versions are presented in [[De Cive|''Libertas'' (liberty)]]:
{{Quote|[...] ''Status hominum naturalis antequam in societatem coiretur, bellum fuerit; neque hoc simpliciter, sed bellum omnium in omnes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22status+hominum+naturalis+antequam+in+societatem+coiretur,+bellum+fuerit;+neque+hoc+simpliciter,+sed+bellum+omnium%22%22in+omnes%22 Chapter 1, section 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural state of men, before they entered into society, was a mere war, and that not simply, but a war of all men against all men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22The+natural+state+of+men,+before+they+entered+into+society,+was+a+mere+war,+and+that+not+simply,+but+a+war+of+all+men+against+all+men%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|''Nam unusquisque naturali necessitate bonum sibi appetit, neque est quisquam qui bellum istud omnium contra omnes, quod tali statui naturaliter adh√¶ret, sibi existimat esse bonum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Nam+unusquisque+naturali+necessitate+bonum+sibi+appetit,+neque+est+quisquam+qui+bellum+istud+omnium+contra+omnes,+quod+tali+statui+naturaliter+adhaeret,+sibi+existimat+esse+bonum%22 Chapter 1, section 13].&lt;/ref&gt;

For every man by natural necessity desires that which is good for him: nor is there any that esteems a war of all against all, which necessarily adheres to such a state, to be good for him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22De+Cive%22%22For+every+man+by+natural+necessity+desires+that+which+is+good+for+him%3A+nor+is+there+any+that+esteems+a+war+of+all+against+all%2C+which+necessarily+adheres+to+such+a+state%2C+to+be+good+for+him%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In chapter XIII of ''Leviathan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html |title=Chapter XIII - Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery |author=Thomas Hobbes |date= |work=bartleby.com |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes explains the concept with these words:
{{Quote|Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war as is of every man against every man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22Hereby+it+is+manifest+that+during+the+time+men+live+without+a+common+Power+to+keep+them+all+in+awe,+they+are+in+that+condition+which+is+called+War;+and+such+a+war+as+is+of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] In such condition there is no place for Industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual Fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22In+such+condition+there+is+no+place+for+Industry,+because+the+fruit+thereof+is+uncertain:+and+consequently+no+Culture+of+the+Earth;+no+Navigation,+nor+use+of+the+commodities+that+may+be+imported+by+Sea;+no+commodious+Building;+no+Instruments+of+moving+and+removing+such+things+as+require+much+force;+no+Knowledge+of+the+face+of+the+Earth;+no+account+of+Time;+no+Arts;+no+Letters;+no+Society;+and+which+is+worst+of+all,+continual+Fear,+and+danger+of+violent+death;+And+the+life+of+man+solitary,+poor,+nasty,+brutish,+and+short%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The thought experiment places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to enter a [[social contract]], giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimation]] of a [[Sovereign state|state]] in fulfilling its role as "[[sovereignty|sovereign]]" to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.

Hobbes distinguishes between war and battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation in which one knows there is a 'Will to contend by Battle'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22+Leviathan+%22Will+to+contend+by+Battle%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses==
In his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785) [[Thomas Jefferson]] uses the phrase ''bellum omnium in omnia'' ("war of all things against all things," assuming ''omnium'' is intended to be neuter like ''omnia'') as he laments that the constitution of that state was twice at risk of being sacrificed to the nomination of a [[dictator]] after the manner of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes on the State of Virginia|author=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher=Lilly and Wait | location=Boston| year=1832|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22ad+libitum+into+any+other+form+of+government+for+precedents+to+rule+us+by,+for+what+oppression+may+not+a+precedent+be+found+in+this+world+of+the+bellum+omnium+in+omnia?%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the phrase is used by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].
* In ''[[On the Jewish Question]]'' (1843-4):
{{Quote|Religion has become the spirit of ''[[civil society]]'', of the sphere of egoism, of ''bellum omnium contra omnes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/+%22Karl+Marx%22+%22On+the+Jewish+Question%22+%22Religion+has+become+the+spirit+of+civil+society,+of+the+sphere+of+egoism,+of+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes.%22 |title=On The Jewish Question - Works of Karl Marx 1844 |date= |work= |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In ''[[Grundrisse|Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1857-8):
{{quote|One could just as well deduce from this abstract phrase that each individual reciprocally blocks the assertion of the others' interests, so that, instead of a general affirmation this war of all against all produces a general negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch03.htm+%22One+could+just+as+well+deduce+from+this+abstract+phrase+that+each+individual+reciprocally+blocks+the+assertion+of+the+others%E2%80%99+interests,+so+that,+instead+of+a+general+affirmation+this+war+of+all+against+all+produces+a+general+negation%22 |title=Grundrisse: Notebook I ‚Äì The Chapter on Money|author=|date= |work= |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|It is remarkable how [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] rediscovers, among the beasts and plants, the society of England with its division of labour, competition, opening up of new markets, 'inventions' and [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthusian]] 'struggle for existence'.

* In a letter to [[Pyotr Lavrov]] (London, 12-17 November 1875), Engels is expressed clearly against any attempt to legitimize the trend anthropomorphizing human nature to the distorted view of natural selection:
{{Quote|The whole Darwinists teaching of the struggle for existence is simply a transference from society to living nature of Hobbes's doctrine of ''bellum omnium contra omnes'' and of the bourgeois-economic doctrine of competition together with Malthus's theory of population. When this conjurer's trick has been performed..., the same theories are transferred back again from organic nature into history and it is now claimed that their validity as eternal laws of human society has been proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/letters/75_11_17-ab.htm+%22The+whole+Darwinists+teaching+of+the+struggle+for+existence+is+simply+a+transference+from+society+to+living+nature+of+Hobbes‚Äôs+doctrine+of+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes%22%22and+of+the+bourgeois-economic+doctrine+of+competition+together+with+Malthus‚Äôs+theory+of+population.+When+this+conjurer‚Äôs+trick+has+been+performed%22 |title=Engels to Pyotr Lavrov In London |author=[[Friedrich Engels]] |others=Transcription/Markup: Brian Baggins|date= |work=Marx-Engels Correspondence 1875 |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
It was also used by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in ''[[On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense]]'' (1873):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">The '''Bishop&amp;ndash;Cannings theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[evolutionary game theory]].  It states that  (i) all members of a mixed [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS) have the same payoff (Theorem 2), and (ii) that none of these can also be a pure ESS&lt;ref name="BandC78"&gt;Bishop, D.T. and Cannings, C. (1978). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMD-4F1J81C-3F&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=bb2a5059fbfc01b42fdf519b4e232cae A generalized war of attrition]. ''[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]'' '''70''':85&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt; (from their Theorem 3). The usefulness of the results comes from the fact that they can be used to directly find [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESSes]] [[algebra]]ically, rather than [[simulating]] the game and solving it by [[iteration]].

The logic of (i) also applies to [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] (all strategies in the support of a mixed strategy receive the same payoff).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The theorem was formulated by [[Tim Bishop (genetic epidemiologist)|Tim Bishop]] and [[Chris Cannings]] at [[Sheffield University]], who published it in 1978.

A review is given by [[John Maynard Smith]] in ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]'', with proof in the appendix.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J. 1982 ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Change generally works in low-income areas, especially within communities of color, and attempts to create resident-based groups to work on local issues of concern. The organization sponsors internships and training programs in several areas, including [[community organizing]], [[service learning]], [[union organizing]], electoral engagement, and youth/student organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/fashion/12organizer.html?_r=2|title=Community Organizing Never Looked So Good|date=April 10, 2009|publisher=New York Times|last1=Rimer|first1=Sara|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides resources for grassroots groups including campaign strategy, funding and social media strategy.

The '''Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology''' (CCACE) is a "centre of excellence" to advance research into how ageing affects cognition, and how mental ability in youth affects health and longevity.

Based at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and funded by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), [[ESRC]], [[BBSRC]] and [[EPSRC]] through the LLHW MRC's Lifelong Health and Wellbeing scheme, the Centre is led by [[Ian Deary|Professor Ian Deary]] alongside 2 co-Directors and 8 Research Group Leaders spread across three University of Edinburgh sites ([[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]], New Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, [[Western General Hospital]]).

The theory also puts forward the notion that ''natural'' categories are [[convex set|convex]] regions in conceptual spaces.&lt;ref name="ZenkerG√§rdenfors2015"/&gt;{{rp|5}} In that if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are elements of a category, and if &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is also likely to belong to the category. The notion of concept convexity allow the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category [[prototype theory|prototypes]]. In the more general formulations of the theory, concepts are defined in terms conceptual similarity to their prototypes.

'''Continuum''' theories or models explain variation as involving gradual [[level of measurement|quantitative]] transitions without abrupt changes or discontinuities. In contrast, categorical theories or models explain variation using [[qualitative property|qualitatively]] different states.&lt;ref&gt;

== In physics ==
In physics, for example, the [[Spacetime|space-time continuum model]] describes space and time as part of the same continuum rather than as separate entities. A [[spectrum]] in physics, such as the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], is often termed as either continuous (with energy at all wavelengths) or discrete (energy at only certain wavelengths).

In contrast, [[quantum mechanics]] uses [[Quantum|quanta]], certain defined amounts (i.e. categorical amounts) which are distinguished from continuous amounts.

== In mathematics and philosophy ==
A good introduction to the philosophical issues involved is [[John Lane Bell]]'s [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ essay] in the [http://plato.stanford.edu/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].  A significant divide is provided by the [[law of excluded middle]].  It determines the divide between [[Intuitionism|intuitionistic]] continua such as [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s and [[Lawvere]]'s, and classical ones such as [[Simon Stevin|Stevin]]'s and [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]]'s.  
Bell isolates two distinct historical conceptions of [[infinitesimal]], one by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and one by [[Nieuwentijdt]], and argues that Leibniz's conception was implemented in Robinson's [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] continuum, whereas Nieuwentijdt's, in Lawvere's [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], characterized by the presence of nilsquare infinitesimals: "It may be said that Leibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of infinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice versa. It is of interest to note that Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in [[nonstandard analysis]], and nilsquare infinitesimals in [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]]".

== In social sciences (in general), psychology and psychiatry ==
In [[social science]]s in general, psychology and psychiatry included, data about differences between individuals, like any data, can be collected and measured using different [[levels of measurement]]. Those levels include dichotomous (a person either has a personality trait or not) and non-dichotomous approaches. While the non-dichotomous approach allows for understanding that everyone lies somewhere on a particular personality dimension, the dichotomous (nominal categorical and ordinal) approaches only seek to confirm that a particular person either has or does not have a particular mental disorder.

Expert witnesses particularly are trained to help courts in translating the data into the legal (e.g. 'guilty' vs. 'innocent') dichotomy, which apply to [[law]], [[sociology]] and [[ethics]].

== Linguistics ==
In [[linguistics]], the range of [[dialect]]s spoken over a geographical area that differ slightly between neighboring areas is known as a [[dialect continuum]]. A language continuum is a similar description for the merging of neighboring languages without a clear defined boundary. Examples of dialect or language continuums include the varieties of Italian or German; and the [[Romance languages]], [[Arabic languages]], or [[Bantu languages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital matte artist''', or '''digital matte painter''' (DMP), is today's modern form of a traditional [[Matte painting|matte painter]] in the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]]. He or she digitally paints photo-realistic interior and exterior environments that could not have been otherwise created or visited.

The term 'digital' is used to distinguish a DMP from a traditional matte painter, although this is unnecessary, as the nature of a matte painter's work remains the same, regardless of the tools and techniques used. [[Craig Barron]], the co-founder of [[Matte World Digital]], offered an insight regarding the transition of the art from traditional to digital in the following words:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to categorize what a matte painting shot is today... Most filmmakers still call what we do matte shots, and we like that because we see our work as an extension of the original craft. But it's more accurate to say we are involved in environment creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art Direction and Production Design|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780813564364|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== From traditional to digital ==
Traditional matte painting is older than the movie camera itself and has actually been already practiced in the early years of photography to create painted elements in photographs. With the advantages of the digital age, matte painters have slowly transitioned to a digital work environment, using pressure-sensitive pens and graphic tablets in conjunction with a painting software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. A digital matte painter is part of a visual effects team being involved in [[post-production]], as opposed to a traditional matte painter, who was a member of a special effects crew, often creating matte paintings on set to be used as backdrops. 

One particular drawback to the work of the digital matte artist is an occasional tendency of their output to look too realistic, which traditional artists avoided by using [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] elements or by suggesting details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic|last=Miller|first=Ron|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2006|isbn=0761329188|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that digital matte art is often characterized by an artificially perfect look. One of the modern approaches adopted to address this is the integration of details from a photograph, say, of real places to depict realistic scenes. It is this reason why some digital matte artists refer to their work as a combination of digital painting, photo manipulation, and 3D, for the purpose of creating virtual sets that are hard or impossible to find in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Art Masters:, Volume 3|last=3Dtotal|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2008|isbn=9780240521190|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow and skillset ==
The involvement of the digital matte artist in film production vary. However, there are artists such as [[Mathieu Raynault]] who stated that they are often brought into the production at a very early stage, providing sketches and concepts to get a dialogue started with the director or art director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Game Secrets for Creative Directors and Producers: Inspired Techniques From Industry Legends|last=Newman|first=Rich|publisher=Focal Press|year=2009|isbn=9780240810713|location=Boston|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynault was involved on films like ''[[300 (film)|300]], [[Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones]]'', and two [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'']] films, among others.

Through the growing need for 'moving' mattes [[3D projection|camera projection mapping]] has been implemented into the matte painting pipeline. Although ILM CG Supervisor [[Stefen Fangmeier]] came up with the idea of projecting Yusei Uesugi's aerial painting of Neverland onto a 3D mesh modeled by Geoff Campbell while working on the motion picture [[Hook (film)|''Hook'']] in 1991, projection-mapping based 3D environment matte art was until recently, like its predecessor matte painting has been, the industry's best-kept secret. The involvement of 3D in this until then 2D art form was revealed by Craig Barron in 1998 after completing their work on the feature film [[Great Expectations (2012 film)|''Great Expectations'']] when they introduced this technique as a 2.5D matte to the public. In production today this combination of 2D and 3D is part of every matte artist's bread and butter.

Because of their high artistic skills, digital matte artists are often also involved with the creation of [[concept art]]work.

{{Violence against women}}
'''Dowry deaths''' are deaths of  women who are [[murder]]ed or driven to [[suicide]] by continuous harassment and torture by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased [[dowry]].

Dowry deaths are found predominantly in India,&lt;ref name=india/&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-003-2014 PAKISTAN: The social injustice behind the practice of dowry-when greed dictates society] Asian Human Rights Commission (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry/&gt; and Iran.&lt;ref name=iranpbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"&gt;Kiani et al. (2014), A Survey on Spousal Abuse of 500 Victims in Iran, American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, 35(1):50-54, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; India reports the highest total number of dowry deaths with 8,391 such deaths reported in 2010, 1.4 deaths per 100,000 women. Adjusted for population, Pakistan, with 2,000 reported such deaths per year, has the highest rate of dowry death at 2.45 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;Subhani, D., Imtiaz, M., &amp; Afza, S.

Dowry death is considered one of the many categories of [[violence against women]], alongside [[rape]], [[bride burning]], [[eve teasing]], and [[acid throwing]].

==India==
{{Further|Dowry system in India}}Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire by her husband or inlaws ; this is known as "[[bride burning]]", and sometimes disguised as suicide or accident. Death by burning of Indian women have been more frequently attributed to dowry conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Virendra|title=Burnt wives|journal=Burns|date=Feb 2003|volume=29|issue=1|pages=31‚Äì36|doi=10.1016/s0305-4179(02)00235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dowry deaths, the groom's family is the perpetrator of murder or suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg, V. T. (2002). Dowry murder: The imperial origins of a cultural crime. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

India has by far the highest number of dowry related deaths in the world according to Indian National Crime Record Bureau. In 2012, 18,233 dowry death cases were reported across India.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite web

===Prohibition===
The ''[[Dowry Prohibition Act]]'' of 1961 prohibits the request, payment or acceptance of a dowry, "as consideration for the marriage", where "dowry" is defined as a gift demanded or given as a precondition for a marriage. Gifts given without a precondition are not considered dowry, and are legal. Asking or giving of dowry can be punished by an imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine of up to {{INRConvert|5000|to=USD GBP AUD}}. It replaced several pieces of anti-dowry legislation that had been enacted by various Indian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/rsPaging.asp?tfnm=196128&amp;Page=1|title=Section 1-4, Dowry Act|author=|date=|website=indiacode.nic.in|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder and suicide under compulsion are addressed by India's criminal penal code.

Indian women's rights activists campaigned for more than 40 years for laws to contain dowry deaths, such as the ''Dowry Prohibition Act'' 1961 and the more stringent [[Dowry law in India#IPC Section 498A|Section 498a of Indian Penal Code]] (enacted in 1983). Under the ''[[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005]]'' (PWDVA), a woman can put a stop to the dowry harassment by approaching a domestic violence protection officer.

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Practical Steps towards Eliminating Dowry and Bride-Burning in India|last = Manchandia|first = Purna|journal = Tul.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the giving and expectation of a dowry (called ''Jahez'') is part of the culture, with over 95% of marriages in every region of Pakistan involving transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to a groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al.

There is some controversy on the dowry death rates in Pakistan. Some publications suggest Pakistan officials do not record dowry deaths, the death rates are culturally under-reported and may be significantly higher. For example, Nasrullah reports total average annual stove burn rates of 33 per 100,000 women in Pakistan, of which 49% were intentional, or an average annual rate of about 16 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nasrullah | first1 =  | last2 = Muazzam | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = Newspaper reports: a source of surveillance for burns among women in Pakistan | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 245‚Äì249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/021027/pakistans-fiery-shame-women-die-stove-deaths#.UiTpaeC5N5g Juliette Terzieff (October 27, 2002) "Pakistan's Fiery Shame: Women Die in Stove Deaths"] ''[[WeNews]]'', New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = B.

Pakistan's ''Dowry and Marriage Gifts (Restriction) Bill'', 2008, restricts dowry to PKR 30,000 (~US$300) while the total value of bridal gifts is limited to PKR 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry  Ashraf Javed (June 9, 2013) "Done to a daughter over dowry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901083633/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry |date=2013-09-01 }}, ''The Nation'' (Pakistan)&lt;/ref&gt; The law made demands for a dowry by the groom's family illegal, as well as public display of dowry before or during the wedding. However, this and similar anti-dowry laws of 1967, 1976 and 1998, as well as ''Family Court Act'' of 1964 have proven to be unenforceable. Activists such as SACHET, Pakistan claim the police refuse to register and prosecute allegations of dowry-related domestic violence and fatal injuries.&lt;ref name=sachet/&gt;

Various military and democratically elected civil governments in Pakistan have tried to outlaw traditional display of dowry and expensive parties (''walima''). One such attempt was the Act of 1997, Ordinance (XV) of 1998 and Ordinance (III) of 1999. These were challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The petitioner cited a number of [[hadith]]s under religious [[Sharia]] laws to demonstrate that Islam encouraged ''walima'' and related customary practices. The petitioner claimed that the Pakistan government's effort to enact these laws are against the injunctions of Islam. The Supreme Court ruled these laws and ordinances unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=sachet&gt;[http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 (2006) Fight Against Dowry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108002609/http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 |date=November 8, 2014 }}, SACHET (Pakistan); also see Dr. A.Q. Khan's July 2003 foreword on widespread Dowry problems to the Prime Minister of Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh==

In Bangladesh, dowry is called joutuk, and a significant cause of deaths as well. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Shahnaz Huda (2006), [http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short Dowry in Bangladesh: Compromizing Women‚Äôs Rights], South Asia Research, November vol. 26 no. 3, pages 249-268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 Women‚Äôs Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109202405/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of death include suicides, fire and other forms of domestic violence. In 2013, Bangladesh reported 4,470 women were victims of dowry-related violence over a 10-month period, or dowry violence victimized about 7.2 brides per year per 100,000 women in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry&gt;UN Women, [http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/CSW/59/National_reviews/Bangladesh_review_Beijing20.pdf Bangladesh Report 2014 - Annexes] United Nations (May 2014), Table 6 page xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
Dowry is an ancient custom of Persia, and locally called ''jah√¢z'' (sometimes spelled ''jahiziyeh'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.steingass.125920 Steingass Persian-English], University of Chicago, See explanation for Jahiz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanpour.com/ Persian English Dictionary] see Dowry&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry-related violence and deaths in Iran are reported in Iranian newspapers, some of which appear in English media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6TxY3lsAL?url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Kiani et al., in a 2014 study, report dowry deaths in Iran.&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"/&gt;

==International efforts at eradication==
Reports of incidents of dowry deaths have attracted public interest and sparked a global activist movement seeking to end the practice. Of this activist community, the [[United Nations]] (UN) has played a pivotal role in combating violence against women, including dowry deaths.

===United Nations===
The United Nations has been an advocate for women's rights since its inception in 1945, explicitly stating so in its Charter's Preamble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the United Nations: Preamble |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005192604/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.html|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1966), the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also adopted in 1966) (these three documents are known collectively as the [[International Bill of Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Law|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012).

The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), though predominately focused on improving the quality of education available to children globally, has also taken a proactive stance against dowry death. On March 9 ([[International Women's Day]]), 2009, at a press conference in Washington D.C., UNICEF's Executive Director, Ann M. Veneman, publicly condemned dowry deaths and the legislative systems which allow the culprits to go unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman on International Women's Day|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_35134.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, UNICEF launched its first Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality, which was followed by a second Action Plan in 2010. The aim of these plans has been to make gender equality a higher priority within all international UNICEF programs and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality: 2010-2012|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private organizations===
[[Amnesty International]], in an effort to educate the public, has cited dowry deaths as a major contributor to global violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence Against Women Information|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in their annual human rights evaluations, Amnesty International criticizes India for the occurrences of dowry deaths as well as the impunity provided to its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/india|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] has also criticized the Indian government for its inability to make any progress towards eliminating dowry deaths and its lackluster performance for bringing its perpetrators to justice in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India: Disappointing Year for Human Rights|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|work=2012-09-04|publisher=Human Rights Watch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108100328/http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Global Fund for Women launched its "Now or Never" funding project. This campaign hopes to raise funds domestically and consequently finance the efforts of feminist organizations across the globe - including Indian women's rights activists. {{as of|2007}} the Now or Never fund has raised and distributed about $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Majesty Queen Noor and Nancy Pelosi Join GFW to Announce Endowment for the World's Women|url=http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|publisher=Global Fund For Women|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108092436/http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively smaller organization, V-Day, has dedicated itself to ending violence against women. By arranging events such as plays, art shows, and workshops in communities and college campuses across the United States, V-Day raises funds and educates the public on topics of gender-based violence including dowry death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dowry Deaths &amp; Bride Burning|url=http://www.vday.org/bride+death|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603074440/http://www.vday.org/bride+death|archivedate=2013-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length plays on dowry deaths include 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRejbq8dbs|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entention''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]] in his 2011 book [[Incomplete Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;* ''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter.''  New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-393-04991-6}} &lt;/ref&gt; The term is deliberately similar to the term [[intention]], which has a long history of use in [[philosophy of mind]], but was designed to have a broader scope. "Ententional" is an [[adjective]] that applies to the class of objects and phenomena that refer to or are in some other way "[[aboutness|about]]" something not present. This [[wikipedia]] page is ententional because it refers to and is explicitly about an abstract concept which is not physically present in the page itself. Other paradigm examples of ententional objects are [[books]], [[DNA]] strands, and [[tools]]. In contrast, [[rocks]], [[stars]], and [[electromagnetic radiation]] are not ententional.

[[Jeremy Sherman]] writes on ententionality, "Deacon coins the term "ententional," to encompass the entire range of phenomena that must be explained, everything from the first evolvable function, to human social processes, everything traditionally called intentional but also everything merely functional, fitting and therefore representing its environment with normative (good or bad fit) consequences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201111/scientific-explanation-the-emergence-mattering-matter&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement of the Field metabolic rate is made using the [[doubly labeled water]] method, although alternative techniques, such as monitoring [[heart rate]]s, can also be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6837">The '''Gayssot Act''' or '''Gayssot Law''' ({{lang-fr|'''Loi Gayssot'''}}), enacted on 13 July 1990, makes it an offense in [[France]] to question the existence or size of the category of [[crimes against humanity]] as defined in the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter of 1945]], on the basis of which [[List of Nazi leaders|Nazi leaders]] were convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] in 1945-46 (art.9). 

== Provisions ==

[[French Communist Party|Communist deputy]] [[Jean-Claude Gayssot]] proposed the law. It is one of several European laws prohibiting [[Holocaust denial]]. Its first article states that "any [[discrimination]] founded on membership or non-membership of an [[ethnic group]], a [[nation]], a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or a [[religion]] is prohibited." The law also requires the [[Commission nationale consultative des droits de l'homme]] (National Consultative Commission on Human Rights), created in 1947, to publish an annual report on relations between ethnicities in France.&lt;ref name="Loi-90-615"&gt;{{cite web |language=French |title=Loi n¬∞ 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990 tendant √† r√©primer tout acte raciste, antis√©mite ou x√©nophobe {{!}} Legifrance |trans-title=Law #90-615 of 13 July 1990 for the Suppression of Racist, Antisemitic, or Xenophobic Acts |last1=Asensi |first1=Fran√ßois  |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000532990&amp;categorieLien=id |date=14 July 1990&lt;!--date of publication in the J.O.--&gt; |website=Legifrance |publisher=Journal officiel de la R√©publique fran√ßaise |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote=Art. 2 - On March 21st of each year, the date established by the U.N. for the [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights provides the government with a report on the fight against racism.

Ce rapport est imm√©diatement rendu public.&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous legislation==
===Marchandeau Decree (1939)===
At the request of the [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]], [[Paul Marchandeau]], [[Radical Party (France)|center-right]] [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] in the 1938-1939 third and fourth [[√âdouard Daladier|Daladier]] governments, issued the decree of 21 April 1939 amending the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881]] by providing prosecution "''when defamation or insult committed against a group of persons, by their origin, race or religion, will have been designed to arouse hatred among citizens or residents''" (translated). This decree  was repealed by the law of the [[Vichy France|Vichy collaborationist government]] of 16 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liauzu |first=Claude |date=1999 |title=La soci√©t√© fran√ßaise face au racisme |trans-title=French Society Face to Face with Racism |language=French |publisher=Editions Complexe |isbn=978-2870277423 |pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pages.livresdeguerre.net/pages/sujet.php?id=docddp&amp;su=103&amp;np=886 Abrogation du d√©cret-loi interdisant les insultes raciales]", Loi du 27 ao√ªt 1940, portant abrogation du d√©cret-loi du 21 avril 1939 modifiant la loi du 29 juillet 1991, ''[[Journal officiel]]'', 30 August 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The decree came again into force after the [[Liberation of France]] in 1944 by an ordinance of 9 August 1944 repealing most of the Vichy legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Devers, "[http://lesactualitesdudroit.20minutes-blogs.fr/archive/2010/07/25/vichy-l-antisemitisme-legalise.html Vichy: L'antis√©mitisme l√©galis√©]", ''Actualit√© du droit'', 25 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071212&amp;dateTexte=20080716 Ordonnance du 9 ao√ªt 1944 relative au r√©tablissement de la l√©galit√© r√©publicaine sur le territoire continental]", ''[[Journal officiel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pleven Law (1972)===
[[Ren√© Pleven]], center-right&lt;ref&gt;former leader (1947-1953), before [[Fran√ßois Mitterrand]], of the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]], then affiliated to various center-right splinter parliamentary groups&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Minister in the [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas|Chaban-Delmas]] and [[Pierre Messmer|Messmer]] governments in 1969-1973, proposed in 1972 a new law against racism, which was unanimously adopted by the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], the 72-546 1st July 1972 Law pertaining to the fight against racism. This law came as a requisite after France's ratification in 1971 of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]. It differed considerably from the 1939 decree which gave to the sole prosecutor's office the right to initiate a procedure, whereas the 1972 law allowed any representative organization to initiate a legal procedure.

==Legal challenges==
After [[Robert Faurisson]] was removed from his university chair under the Gayssot Act, he challenged it as a violation of his right to [[freedom of expression]] under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). The [[Human Rights Committee]] upheld the condemnation of Faurisson, but mentioned that the Gayssot Act may be too broad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/385c2add1632f4a8c12565a9004dc311/4c47b59ea48f7343802566f200352fea?OpenDocument Communication No 550/1993 : France. 16/12/96. CCPR/C/58/D/550/1993, Human Rights Committee, Fifty-eighth session, 21 October - 8 November 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Constitutional Court's ruling that the Gayssot Act is constitutional but that the 2012 [[Armenian Genocide]] Denial Law was unconstitutional because it violated freedom of speech, has been challenged.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}

The '''harm principle''' holds that the actions of [[individual]]s should only be limited to prevent [[harm]] to other individuals. [[John Stuart Mill]] articulated this principle in ''[[On Liberty]]'', where he argued that, "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="leeds1"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#HarPriFreSpe| accessdate = 10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An equivalent was earlier stated in France's ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789 as, "Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law."

== Definition ==
The belief "that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of others" has become one of the basic principles of libertarian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hamowy, ''The encyclopaedia of libertarianism'', Sage, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC p. xxi], ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase "harm principle" was not itself used until 1969{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, the harm principle itself was first fully articulated by the English thinker [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806‚Äì1873) in the first chapter of ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859),&lt;ref name="leeds1"/&gt; where he argued that:
{{Quotation|The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the [[liberty]] of action of any of their number, is self-protection. '''That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his [[will (philosophy)|will]], is to prevent harm to others.''' His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is [[sovereign individual|sovereign]].|[[John Stuart Mill]]|&lt;ref name="On Liberty"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=on+liberty&amp;pg=PP1&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?rlz=&amp;q=On+Liberty&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA21,M1 |author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|publisher=Oxford University|year=1859|pages=21‚Äì22|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even if a self-regarding action results in harm to oneself, it is still beyond the sphere of justifiable state coercion.

Harm itself is not a non-moral concept. The infliction of harm upon another person is what makes an action wrong.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitinture.com/documents/oliveira.pdf|last=Menezes Oliveira|first=Jorge|title=Harm and Offence in Mill‚Äôs Conception of Liberty|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harm can also result from a failure to meet an obligation. Morality generates obligations. Duty may be exacted from a person in the same way as a debt, and it is part of the notion of duty that a person may be rightfully compelled to fulfil it.&lt;ref name="On Liberty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;

== The offense principle ==

Mill's harm principle is distinct from the offense principle. The basis of comparison is that, in some cases, psychological or social harm may be comparable to physical harm. The difference is based on the assumption that offense may cause discomfort, but does not necessarily cause harm. Offense meets the harm principle only if it is a wrong and also causes harm.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The harm principle states that the only actions that can be prevented are ones that create harm. In other words, a person can do whatever he wants as long as his actions do not harm others. If a person's actions only affect himself, then society, which includes the government, should not be able to stop a person from doing what he wants. This even includes actions that a person may do that would harm the person himself.

However, we{{who|date=July 2018}} cannot just stop there and think that Mill makes things seem so simple, because he doesn't. If we were to stop our discussion of the harm principle at 'anyone can do whatever they want just so long as it doesn't affect anyone else,' problems arise. One such problem may be what to do with people who want to end their own life. Mill said it would not be okay for this to happen.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

For this to make the most sense, we need to understand three important ideas that helped shape the harm principle. The first is that the harm principle comes from another principle called the principle of utility.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The principle of utility states that people should only do those things that bring the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest number of people. So, if a person is trying to decide between two things, he should choose the option that makes the most people happy.

The second idea is that Mill says there is a difference between harm and offense.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Harm is something that would injure the rights of someone else or set back important interests that benefit others. An example of harm would be assaulting someone, causing them injury. An offense, according to Mill, is something that we would say 'hurt our feelings.'{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} These are less serious and should not be prevented, because what may hurt one person's feelings may not hurt another's, and so offenses are not universal.

The third idea to understand is that it is very rare for an action to only affect the individual himself. Mill argues that no person is truly isolated from others and that most actions do affect other people in important ways.

The ethical question as to what extent there should be constraints on [[free speech]] is often grounded in both the harm principle and the offense principle. If the exercise of free speech can be causally linked to violence or similar physical harm, it is constrained under the harm principle. Free speech actions such as burning a flag or holding controversial rallies usually fall under the offense principle instead, based on the corresponding question of what constitutes harm (or, alternately, weighing harm caused by limiting a freedom vs harm caused by the exercise of that freedom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/harm-principle-offense-principle-skokie-affair|title=Harm Principle, Offense Principle, and the Skokie Affair|last=Cohen-Almagor|first=Raphael|publisher=Political Studies|year=1993|volume=41|number=3|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the abstract, criminalizing all wrongs that cause harm makes the offense principle almost synonymous with the harm principle.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, the definition of what constitutes a wrong may change over time‚Äîsuch that harm may be caused by actions that were not considered wrongs at the time, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=E18D1EC7964F7D517E189DC596C451DF.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=118187|title=Rethinking the Offense Principle|last=Simester|first=A.P.|last2=von Hirsch|first2=Andrew|publisher=Legal Theory|year=2002|volume=8|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broader definitions of harm ==

In the same essay, Mill further explains the principle as a function of two maxims:

{{Quotation| The maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people, if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct. Secondly, that '''for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments, if society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection.''' (LV2)}}

The second of these maxims has become known as the social authority principle.&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;

However, the second maxim also opens the question of broader definitions of harm, up to and including harm to the society. The concept of harm is not limited to harm to another individual but can be harm to individuals plurally, without specific definition of those individuals.

This is an important principle for the purpose of determining harm that only manifests gradually over time‚Äîsuch that the resulting harm can be anticipated, but does not yet exist at the time that the action causing harm was taken. It also applies to other issues‚Äîwhich range from the right of an entity to discharge broadly polluting waste on private property, to broad questions of licensing, and even to the right of sedition.

== Modern examples ==
=== The harm principle in US libertarianism ===
The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|United States Libertarian Party]] includes a version of the harm principle as part of its official [[party platform]]. It states:
{{Quotation|Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Therefore, we favor the repeal of all laws creating ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù without victims . . .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/platform/|title=2016 Platform|publisher=Libertarian National Committee|year=2016|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:LifeOnTerranova.png|thumb|Characters, creatures, artifacts and machines unique to the universe of '''''Heavy Gear''''']]
'''Heavy Gear''' is a game universe published since 1994 by [[Canada|Canadian]] publisher [[Dream Pod 9]]. It includes a tabletop tactical [[Wargaming|wargame]], a [[role-playing game]] and a lesser known combat [[card game]] (''[[Heavy Gear Fighter]]''). The setting is also known through the [[Personal computer|PC]]-game incarnations published by [[Activision]] in 1997 and 1999, developed after Activision lost the rights to the ''[[Battletech]]''/''[[MechWarrior (video game series)|MechWarrior]]'' series. It also spawned a 40-episodes, 3D-animated TV series in 2001, which featured a much simplified version of the universe developed in the [[role-playing game]].

The background universe of the game is extremely detailed: several million words have been published to date in more than a hundred books and game accessories. A continual epic storyline runs throughout all of the game's material, with new publications moving chronologically along the timeline. ''Heavy Gear'' is best known for its humanoid combat vehicles (or [[mecha]]): the 'Gears' and 'Striders' used by the military forces in the setting.

==Plot and setting==
''Heavy Gear'' is set on a distant, fictional planet called Terra Nova around 4,000 [[Earth]] Standard Years from now (AD 6132). Terra Nova was once the pride of the United Earth Government's colonies. However, an economic collapse forced the UEG government to abandon Terra Nova and all its other colonies centuries before the period depicted in the game setting, leaving Terra Nova in a dark age. Eventually, [[City-state]]s rose from the ashes and either through treaties or tyranny, united to form national unions called Leagues. These Leagues would in turn ally (again either peacefully or forcibly) to form the superpower blocs that dominated the temperate southern and northern hemispheres of the planet.

The planet's geography is primarily land containing deep underground water reserves, but few large bodies of open water, and no oceans. This is unlike Earth which is covered by 70% ocean. The planet has its own existing ecosystem of plants and animals, though most animals are reptilian in nature, such as the bison like Barnaby used as livestock, and the prolific Hopper which is the equivalent of Earth's rabbit. The single dominant land feature is a massive mineral rich, hot, desert belt around the equator of the world known as the Badlands. This territory is not dominated by any one political group, and is considered open territory to everyone, and contains many bandit groups known as Rovers. Most people live in the northern or southern polar regions where temperatures are more acceptable to human life, and other terrain types such as forests, grasslands, swamps and jungles can be found. Small ice caps with arctic conditions and glaciers are found on the true north and true south poles.

As the setting is primarily the backdrop for a series of strategy, roleplaying, and video games the military and weaponry are the main focus. One of the most popular weapon systems of the various groups on Terra Nova are the machines known as Heavy Gears that give the universe its name. They are 12- to 20-foot-tall ({{convert|12|to|20|ft|m|disp=output only}}) bipedal, armored, single occupancy military combat units. The Gears are less heavily armed and armored than main battle tanks used by the Terra Nova armies. However, the Gears provide a mix of capabilities that prove effective as the setting/game rules typically allow victory through maneuver warfare and place less emphasis on raw firepower and armor.

Several major wars take place over time, including the War of the Alliance. A new dictatorial government on [[Earth]] attempts to re-take its former colonies by force using its own advanced war machines such as hover tanks and armies of purple skinned GREL super soldiers (Genetically Recombinant Expeditionary Legionaries). In this war both the North and the South cooperate to fight off the Colonial Expeditionary Force, which during their first defeat and withdrawal abandon many personnel (both human and GREL), who eventually settle Terra Nova and form the city-state of Port Arthur.

As of 6132 AD (TN 1936, local calendar), the Confederated Northern City-States (CNCS) and the Allied Southern Territories (AST) are recovering and rebuilding from the War of the Alliance. Despite the looming common threat posed by the eventual return of Earth's colonial armies, the polar superpowers have great fear and animosity for each other, an analogy of the real world [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]], while the independent City-States of the Badlands simply try to survive the crossfire.

==Confederated Northern City-States==
The political situation on Terra Nova has three major nations of the north polar region banding together to form their alliance called the Confederated Northern City-States to oppose the Allied Southern Territories from the south pole.

===Northern Light Confederacy===
A large nation known for its devotion to the major religion of Sorrento Revisionism based on the teachings of an early wandering desert colonist prophet named Mamoud. Sorrento Revisionism is a sect that preaches conservatism, and the necessary use of force to make the world a better place.  They are most often motivated to conflict by that reason, and even incorporate chaplains into military units.

===Mercantile Federation ===
An industrial power that puts a price on everything, including buying and selling votes in their political system, and has a keen interest in exploiting the untapped resources buried in the sand and rock of the Badlands.

===Western Frontier Protectorate===
A region of open plains and ranching that promote family, hard work, and patriotism by military service.  Indeed, the WFP requires a person to be a reservist in the Protectorate armed forces in order to be elected to high office, and only military veterans may vote.

==Allied Southern Territories==
The south pole of Terra Nova likewise has an overall political grouping known as the Allied Southern Territories. Unlike the three nations forming the CNCS, which are generally on an equal level with one another politically, the Southern Republic dominates over the other three southern nations in order to field the strength necessary to meet Northern aggressive policies towards them.

===Southern Republic===
The real power of the southern pole. They are the largest nation on the planet with both territory and population, and dominate the other southern nations by military force if necessary. They are openly free with many individual rights of expression, a high level of art and culture, and legalised vices, but with the major exception of freedom for political dissent. The government is intolerant of dissent and opposition groups, and employs secret police. Prisoners often form poorly trained and equipped military units.

===Mekong Dominion===
A nation of manufacturing, money lending, and corporations as government. They are also minimally armed, using their small military as a dual purpose police force and often hires outside forces to supplement their own when necessary.

===Humanist Alliance===
This nation uses science and technology to structure their society in an attempt to create harmony and utopia. This ideal has almost attained religious status in their people. They place citizens into castes based on aptitude testing and are highly educated at all levels. Research and development, and an efficient skilled work force are some of their greatest assets.

===Eastern Sun Emirates===
A fractured nation of individual City-States that are almost nations unto themselves. They are led by hereditary monarchs known as Emirs who rule over their common citizens with no middle class in between.

==Minor powers on Terra Nova==
Along with the major polar regions, several smaller factions exist on Terra Nova.

===Peace River===
An independent city state in the Badlands of Terra Nova. They are an industrial nation capable of sophisticated, but practical manufacturing. This nation is home to Paxton Arms, one of the few independent corporations outside the two polar regions to build military hardware, including Heavy Gears of their own design. Peace River is the largest independent nation in the Badlands.  The Peace River military also tries its best to defend other bandland nations from encroachments by either polar League, but is often stretched thin to cover such a vast area. Their other major conflicts involve Rovers, the bandits of the Badlands.

===Port Arthur===
The remnants of the failed expeditionary army sent by Earth to reconquer Terra Nova, Port Arthur was one of their primary staging bases in the Badlands. Over one-hundred thousand human officers and GREL (Genetically Recombinated Expeditionary Legionaries) super-soldiers were abandoned by the Earth fleet concentrated on Port Arthur. From here they have established a nation for themselves, and benefit from the high technology of the Colonial Expeditionary Force (CEF) hover tanks, and GREL infantry to safeguard their territory.

===Rovers and independents===
Most people in the Badlands owe their allegiance to no nation. They live as families, gangs, or individuals. Small facilities of human habitation known as Oasis Towers are spotted around the Badlands at any available surface, or shallow wells of water, and small-scale agriculture can even be attempted. However, most Badlanders make their living as miners or caravan traders. They ply back and forth between the polar regions and far flung industrial sites of the Badlands selling and buying goods.

Rovers are the criminal element of the Badlands. They are groups of local outcasts, criminals escaping the law, deserters fleeing their homelands, simple runaways, or even hereditary rovers born to other rovers who live in the wilds of the badlands and prey on local trade caravans, independent miners, and homesteaders.

They are a common problem in the lawless Badlands. Rather than work for their living, they take from others. Most Badlanders protect themselves in some fashion, though an unwritten code has developed over time where Rovers only take enough for themselves, and will not leave their victims destitute or without the supplies to survive. However, the cruelty and/or humanity of the Rover bands runs the full spectrum of decency. Many Rover bands even operate Heavy Gears salvaged from forgotten battle fields, stolen, or even bought on the open or black markets.

==Mysteries and oddities of ''Heavy Gear''==
The ''Heavy Gear'' series has a number of unresolved mysteries in the setting. A few of these are listed below. It is unknown if any of these will be revealed due to the developer turnover at [[Dream Pod 9]].

*Stoneheads: The planet of Terra Nova is sprinkled with large round stone heads similar to those of [[Easter Island]] but with a much more Asian style. These date back to the earliest colonization of the planet or possibly before and the meaning of the giant markers is unknown.
*The Koreshi, or sand-riders, are a culture of desert-dwelling nomads similar to the [[Fremen]] of the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series]]. Their existence on Terra Nova is a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|title=Gear Most Heavy ‚Äî the Dream Pod 9 Interview, Part 1|url=http://www.robotviking.com/2010/07/28/gear-most-heavy-the-dream-pod-9-interview-part-1/|work=Robot Viking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414140124/http://www.robotviking.com/2010/07/28/gear-most-heavy-the-dream-pod-9-interview-part-1/|archivedate=2013-04-14|quote="Heavy Gear‚Äôs fictional storyline also takes some inspiration from Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune in terms of some of the ongoing mysteries of the universe like the Koreshi (sandriders who are rumoured to be descended from the legendary Prime Knight soldiers of Earth and live in the harshest desert of the Terra Novan equatorial badlands)."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*One of the CEF's fleets disappeared when sent to the colony world of New Jerusalem.
**(The fate of this fleet is touched upon on the ''Return to Cat's Eye'' book for ''Heavy Gear Blitz!''.)
*The Eastern Sun Emirates saw massive changes during the published ''Storyline Books'' culminating in the launch of an ancient spacecraft. It is unknown where that spacecraft went.
*MacAllen cave network: Much of the water on Terra Nova is subterranean. The MacAllen network of caves contains most of it, and is nearly a worldwide phenomenon.  Natural artesian springs appear all over the globe, even occasionally in the deep deserts of the Badlands. Most of the network is deep underground, often thousands of feet below the surface. Even whole ecosystems of life exist in some of the airless and perpetually dark areas of the network. The extent of the cave system is unknown.
*White Sand: One of the more unusual hazards of the equatorial deserts of the Badlands is the phenomenon known as white sand.  This sand is highly corrosive and dangerous volcanic ash. It is so corrosive it can destroy machinery and can slowly eat through most metals chemically. It is even used as weaponry in the form of bags of sand thrown into air-intakes or to be inhaled.
*Bowser: A near sentient ONNet computer installed into a CNCS heavy gear that has run away from its military base without a pilot. Sightings of Bowser occasionally filter in from the Badlands.
**(Bowser is known to be piloted by Sadie "Boom Boom" Toepfer in the ''Heavy Gear Arena'' book.)
*Landships: Unusual magnetic properties of the planet Terra Nova allow for large ships able to hover a few feet off the ground known as Landships. They form the equivalent of a "wet navy" that other planets with surface water would have. A minimum size is necessary to take advantage of this unexplained property, so all Landships are the size of oceangoing vessels such as frigates, destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Because of their cost, they are uncommon.
*Order of the Blue Crescent. A religious group based on the teachings of the desert prophet Mamoud. Blue Crescent Adherents typically shave their hair bald, tattoo a blue Crescent on their foreheads, give up all personal property beyond what they can carry, and must visit the major locations that Mamoud once lived in the Badlands during their life. They are noted for being generous, friendly, and often volunteer for civic duties and charities, but are not pacifists.  Blue Crescent Adherents can be found serving in the military of many of Terra Nova's Leagues.

==Heavy Gears==
The namesake machines of the universe setting are the Heavy Gears.  They are 12- to 20-foot-tall ({{convert|12|to|20|ft|m|disp=output only}}) machines usually weighing between 5 and 12 tons, that resemble [[Mecha|robotic humanoids]].  They seat a single pilot inside the chest and head unit. They provide a flexibility to the battlefield of Heavy Gear setting that make them more useful than most other units, though they do not dominate.  They can traverse more difficult terrain faster, and change direction swifter than tanks, which is important to a setting that emphasizes mobility, and not just firepower, to succeed in combat.

They are powered by a unique piston engine called a V-engine mounted as a backpack. This is different from most science fiction settings, which use some form of [[nuclear power]] or a more obscure or invented power source. Confusingly, this V-engine is not the same design as a modern [[V-engine]], but an alternative working design invented by students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. The engine works by having two rotating cylindrical engine blocks with multiple chambers in each block. The blocks somewhat resemble large scale cylinders from a revolver handgun. The two rotating cylinders are set approximately 90 degrees from each other, and shared between each rotating block are several solid V-shaped rods that serve as pistons. As the blocks rotate inside their static housings openings in the sides of the rotating and static portions of the engine will line up and act as intake and exhaust ports, and also electrical contact connections trigger the spark plugs. The rotation of the cylinder blocks can then be tapped for electrical power generation or directly for hydraulic pressure.

The computer system that enables the machines to move and operate fluidly are called Optical Neural Networks, or ONNets for short. They are learning computers that work, in many ways, similarly to an organic brain and are trained to perform advanced tasks instead of being programmed with software. They operate using light instead of electricity, and use microscopic crystals to form logic circuits for the light to pass through. New connections are made over time by the computer and allow it to learn new instructions. This factor leads the ONNet computer to develop traits, instincts, and habits over time based on the pilots that operate with them. Some functions become automatic as the computer tries to predict what the pilot wants and has used in the past in similar situations. This allows faster reactions in most situations, but can sometimes also cause indecision on the ONNet's part if tactics or patterns change in an unusual situation. Heavy Gear pilots tend to form a bond with their Gears' ONNets, or at least recognize the efficiency that an experienced ONNet provides; pilots forced to abandon a damaged or disabled Gear often take with them the ONNet unit from beneath their seats.

The weaponry of the Heavy Gear is usually lighter and less powerful than a main battle tank, as Gears themselves typically weigh only a fifth (or less) the weight of a tank. They typically have one [[automatic cannon]] carried as a Gear sized hand held [[assault rifle]]. They also typically have a shoulder mounted multiple-launch [[missile launcher]] rack, as well as a small anti-personnel fragmentation [[grenade launcher]] for use against infantry. However, variants of many machines, especially heavier models, can carry or mount a wide variety of weapons, such as heavy [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[bazookas]], guided missiles, larger hand-held grenade launchers, field guns or cannons, and even advanced directed energy weapons.

Heavy Gears can walk, run, crawl, and generally mimic most of the mobility of the human form, on which they are patterned. This flexibility affords the Heavy Gear many of the advantages of an infantryman, such as the ability to traverse difficult terrain and make effective use of cover, while at the same time having the resilience and firepower of a light armored vehicle. Most Gears also have a secondary movement system consisting of wheels (or tracks for heavier gears) fitted to the soles of their feet, powered either by efficient electric motors or a drive train connected to the V-Engine. The use of the alternate movement systems afford a higher speed and increased fuel efficiency on roads or flat terrain, and reduce wear on leg joints when traveling long distances. However, the wheels sacrifice maneuverability and cannot be used in heavy terrain due to their relatively small size, requiring the Gear to switch back to walker mode which excels at the task.

==Artwork and design==
[[File:DP9-9996 Heavy Gear Blitz Locked &amp; Loaded.png|thumb|Cover of the ''Heavy Gear Blitz! Locked &amp; Loaded'' rulebook]]
The ''Heavy Gear'' books are notable for their heavily illustrated content. Each book features highly detailed plans and cutaways of the machines, along with flags, insignias, maps and other visual information to help players' immersion. Most of the artwork was done by illustrator [[Ghislain Barbe]], who was also responsible for the artwork of ''[[Jovian Chronicles]]'', another [[Dream Pod 9]] game. Although he left Dream Pod 9, Ghislain produced book covers for the ''Heavy Gear'' franchise until ''Heavy Gear Blitz! Locked &amp; Loaded''.  Currently, artwork is provided by a team of individuals; Avelardo Paredes, Mariko Shimamoto and David Tauzia, among others.

The main themes of many artworks include the Heavy Gears themselves, with distinctive backpacks for the V-engine, single eye head units, and at least a small area of the machine painted with an alternating yellow and black warning stripe paint scheme.

Northern military combat machines are typically shaped with square armor plates, and are usually named for predatory mammals such as bears and large cats.

Southern military units are likewise given a distinctive look.  They usually include numerous rounded and spherical shaped armor plates.  They are usually named for reptiles, often snakes.

==Rules==
All editions of ''Heavy Gear'' use some variation of Dream Pod 9's own [[Silhouette (role-playing game system)|''Silhouette'' game system]]. The first and second editions of the game contain both Role-playing and Tactical Wargame Rules. "Tactical" ''Heavy Gear'' calls for the use of hex maps and paper counters or miniatures.

The third edition of the ''Heavy Gear RPG'' uses a separate ''Silhouette CORE Rulebook'', which is needed for play. The ''Heavy Gear 3rd Edition'' book contains useful summaries from many 2nd edition products, combined with some detailed statistics for both the SilCORE and OGL D20 systems.

''Heavy Gear: Blitz! Locked &amp; Loaded'' is the most recent ''Heavy Gear: Blitz!'' rulebook, the first of which was released concurrently in 2006 with a new line of miniatures. It contains no role-playing material and is styled as a dedicated wargame; it contains a streamlined rule system, an innovative new army building system, complete army lists and background information for five factions, a basic campaign system, a painting guide, and a  timeline of historic events in the Heavy Gear universe. The ''Heavy Gear: Blitz!'' rules are intended for use with 1:144 scale model terrain, but it is still possible to use hexed mapsheets and paper counters.

The ''Heavy Gear Blitz!'' ruleset was a nominee for the 2007 Origins Award for Best Miniatures Game or Expansion of the Year.

In May, 2009, Dream Pod 9 released "Return to Cat's Eye", the first expansion book for ''Heavy Gear Blitz!'', which provides background information and army lists for three new armies.

===''Silhouette CORE RPG'' Rules===
The ''Silhouette RPG'', known in later editions as ''SilCORE'' is a [[GNS Theory|simulationist]] system that defines characters in terms of 10 base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the "backbone" of the system, while basic and derived Attributes serve as modifiers to the roll.

The task resolution and tests involve rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result, adding in modifiers for attributes and/or situation, and then comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Characters may suffer penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points.

Some players regard the system as particularly lethal, especially for inexperienced characters. A variety of optional rules are available in the ''SilCORE'' rulebook to mitigate this lethality.

[[Dream Pod 9|DP9]] ceased producing RPGs between 2006-2008 for their entire game catalog, including ''Heavy Gear''.

On August 27, 2008, Steve Jackson Games announced that they had entered into an agreement with Dream Pod 9 to produce a fourth edition of a ''Heavy Gear'' roleplaying game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archives.html?y=2008&amp;m=August&amp;d=27&lt;/ref&gt; The project never got past the planning stages, however, and on August 9, 2010, Steve Jackson Games announced that they were relinquishing the rights to ''Heavy Gear'' back to DP9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjgames.com/ill/a/2010-08-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Dream Pod 9 announced that they would produce a fourth edition of a ''Heavy Gear'' RPG themselves, with a tentative release date of late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robotviking.com/2010/07/28/gear-most-heavy-the-dream-pod-9-interview-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414140124/http://www.robotviking.com/2010/07/28/gear-most-heavy-the-dream-pod-9-interview-part-1/ |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was not published.

===''Heavy Gear'' 20th Anniversary Edition===
On March 5, 2014, Dream Pod 9 announced that a new ''Heavy Gear'' RPG would be produced by Arkrite Press LLC, which is co-owned by Dream Pod 9 staff members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dp9.com/content/heavy-gear-roleplaying-game-press-release-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy Gear Fighter==
Heavy Gear Fighter is a stand-alone two-player card game set in the Heavy Gear universe. It was published by Dream Pod 9 in 1994, and is currently out of print.

===Game description===
Heavy Gear Fighter is a card-based dueling game in which two Heavy Gears duel in the Badlands. It is not a [[collectible card game]]; everything needed to play is contained in the box.

Every playing card is illustrated with a full color picture of a Gear. They are divided into Attacks of various strengths, Defenses, and Special Effects. Both players draw from the same pile.

The game does not use dice or paper. Each playable Gear has a full color record/action sheet that is used to keep track of actions/damage with small counters. Cards are dealt from a player's hand to cause damage, defend against enemy attacks, and create various special effects.

===Expansion sets===
The game received an official expansion set, Equipment &amp; Weapons, in 1995. As its name implies, it added new Equipment and Weapon cards that could be played on the Gears.

Several "mini-sets" were included as promotional material in the pages of various magazines, notably [[Mecha Press]] and [[White Wolf Magazine]]. These cards were always optional and allowed players to create special combat conditions as well as execute different maneuvers.

A set was designed that would have featured new vehicles (notably tanks and Striders), but it was never published.

==Miniatures==
[[File:Heavy Gear Blitz-Grizzly.jpg|thumb|A 1:144 scale HACS-02HG-MPS Grizzly, from [[Dream Pod 9]]'s tabletop [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] [[wargaming|wargame]] '''Heavy Gear ''Blitz!''''']]
''Heavy Gear'' has had three successive lines of [[wargaming]] [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] starting with the ''[[RAFM Company, Inc.|RAFM]]'' produced 1:87 [[Scale model|scale]] line, then the in-house produced 1:144 scale ''Tactical Rules'' and varying scale ''Fleet'' line, and the current 1:144 scale resculpted line for ''Heavy Gear: Blitz!''

The '''1:87 scale''' ''RAFM'' line was launched in 1995. The miniatures were largely cast in [[lead]] until public safety concerns, originally raised in 1993, influenced the [[Miniature wargaming|gaming]] industry to cast lead-free miniatures. The price increase from the adoption of lead-free [[pewter]] made [[Dream Pod 9]] reconsider the size and scale of their miniatures. As a result, the ''RAFM'' line of ''Heavy Gear'' miniatures was discontinued and never expanded beyond the Northern and Southern Terra Novan factions.

The '''1:144 scale''' (12mm) ''Tactical Rules'' line was launched in 1997. It was largely the result of a desire to decrease the production cost inherent in lead-free, pewter miniatures. The ''Tactical Rules'' line was also developed with a greater attention to the control of proportions of the various ''Heavy Gear'' designs using [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] illustrations as guides. The ''Heavy Gear'' miniature range was then expanded beyond the Northern and Southern factions to include designs from the Badlands and Colonial Earth Forces factions. The later ''Tactical Rules'' line miniatures were sculpted by Philippe Ferrier Le Clerc, who joined [[Dream Pod 9]] in 2001. He also provided ''Heavy Gear'' limited edition resin miniatures through his boutique studio, Minimaniak.

During the same era as the ''Tactical Rules'' miniatures, ''Fleet Scale'' miniatures were also introduced which ranged from '''1:350 scale''' for infantry, tanks, heavy gears, and striders to '''1:3500 scale''' for [[landship]]s.

The '''1:144 scale''' (12mm) ''Heavy Gear: Blitz!'' line was launched in 2006. It preserved some of the ''Tactical Rules'' line miniatures for recasting. However, the majority of the ''Tactical Rules'' line miniatures will be resculpted. The intention of this change was that the miniatures bear a closer resemblance to the original hand drawn illustrations, that they have a greater range of possible poses, and that unit recognition is made easier for overall improved [[gameplay]]. In order to accomplish this, the difference in size between some miniatures has been exaggerated by approximately 10% and the miniatures are now cast on sprues, which allows many smaller, modular parts to be cast. Another effect of the ''Heavy Gear: Blitz!'' line of miniatures has been an appreciable increase in detail due to new sculpting and resin-master casting techniques. It has also produced the first new ''Heavy Gear'' designs in many years.

[http://www.dp9.com/fusion/KitPages/kodiak.htm Fusion Models] has also produced a '''1:35 scale''' resin model of ''Heavy Gear''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Kodiak heavy assault Gear.

==Video games==
{{Main|Heavy Gear (video game)|Heavy Gear II}}
Faced with the loss of the ''[[BattleTech]]''-''[[MechWarrior (series)|MechWarrior]]'' property, [[Activision]]'s Production Executive, [[Frank Evers (CEO)]], spearheaded the acquisition of the video game license in 1995. The first game, ''[[Heavy Gear (video game)|Heavy Gear]]'', was released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/heavy-gear-series&lt;/ref&gt; The second game, ''[[Heavy Gear II]]'', was made in 1999 for the Windows 98 operating system.

After years of the franchise laying dormant a licensing deal was announced on August 1, 2012 between Stompy Bot Productions and the owner of the franchise Dream Pod 9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stompy-bot-productions-to-produce-new-heavy-gear-video-game-164654816.html&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Kickstarter]] campaign for ''Heavy Gear Assault'' was launched but eventually cancelled in 2013. The game relaunched in 2015 in [[early access]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcgamer.com/heavy-gear-assault-enters-early-access/&lt;/ref&gt; The game is developed by MekTek Studios and published by Stompy Bot Productions for Windows and Linux. It's being developed with [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]] and is scheduled for a full release in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/app/416020&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV series==
In 2001, a computer-animated TV series titled ''Heavy Gear: The Animated Series'' was produced by [[Audu Paden]] at [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and [[Adelaide Productions]] for [[Columbia TriStar Television]]. The series lasted 40 episodes (though two of these were "recap" episodes and more still were clip shows). It played in syndication in various markets worldwide.

The [[Dream Pod 9]] creative staff had very little input in the series' content, and the animated universe differs significantly from the game's. The show was aimed at an audience much younger than the one the property had previously targeted. The producers' original intent was to start the series with a mecha-combat tournament held between the villainous Vanguard of Justice and the honorable Shadow Dragons (representatives of Terra Nova's Northern and Southern armies respectively), but after the resolution of the tournament storyline rising tensions would lead to war between the North and South, which would in turn be followed by an invasion from Earth trying to reconquer its old colony planet, forcing the North and South to join forces for their own survival. Worries that having the villains from the early episodes (the Vanguard characters) suddenly working with the heroes, and shifting from a tournament-styled competition to all-out mecha warfare, would have been too confusing for their targeted age group led to a decision to not use the war storyline. What ended up happening on the show was that they ran the tournament storyline as planned but even though the tournament had been 'won' within the first dozen or so episodes, the two teams just kept having exhibition matches and the like for the remainder of the 40-episode run.

The "in-universe" explanation for the difference between the universes is that the animated series is a Terra Novan entertainment program not unlike real-world [[professional wrestling]].

DVD releases include two volumes released in North America in 2002 by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] each with five episodes edited together into "feature length" stories. 2004 saw a release in the UK of a two disc ''Season One'' set including both "feature length" stories and three standalone episodes which collectively present the first thirteen episodes of the series in one form or other, but lacks the bonus content present on the North American releases. Also in 2004 Anchor Bay issued a single disc release in Canada with another five episodes from later in the series.

The entire series was formerly available for streaming for free in the US and Canada on Sony owned [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]]. It was also formerly available for streaming in Canada on [[Netflix]].{{when|date=August 2012}}

The episodes were originally produced in widescreen and presented as such on the DVD releases, while most syndication broadcasts were of a cropped pan and scan version of each episode. The streaming versions formerly available from Crackle and Netflix were also of these pan and scan versions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28409">In [[economics]], '''hyperbolic discounting''' is a time-''inconsistent'' model of [[delay discounting]]. It is one of the cornerstones of [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref name=Ain2015&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mde.2715 | volume=37 | title=The Cardinal Anomalies that Led to Behavioral Economics: Cognitive or Motivational? | year=2015 | journal=Managerial and Decision Economics | pages=261‚Äì273 | last1 = Ainslie | first1 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grune-Yan&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0269889715000307 | volume=28 | title=Models of Temporal Discounting 1937‚Äì2000: An Interdisciplinary Exchange between Economics and Psychology | year=2015 | journal=Science in Context | pages=675‚Äì713 | last1 = Gr√ºne-Yanoff | first1 = Till}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discounted utility approach states that [[intertemporal choice]]s are no different from other choices, except that some consequences are delayed and hence must be anticipated and discounted (i.e., reweighted to take into account the delay).

Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Humans are said to ''discount'' the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. This process is traditionally modeled in the form of [[exponential discounting]], a time-''consistent'' model of discounting. A large number of studies have since demonstrated deviations from the constant discount rate assumed in exponential discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Shane |first2=George |last2=Loewenstein |first3=Ted |last3=O'Donoghue |year=2002 |title=Time Discounting and Time Preference: A Critical Review |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=351‚Äì401 |doi=10.1257/002205102320161311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyperbolic discounting is an alternative mathematical model that accounts for these deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = Leonard | last2 = Myerson | first2 = Joel | year = 2004 | title = A discounting framework for choice with delayed and probabilistic rewards | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 769‚Äì792 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.769| pmc = 1382186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to hyperbolic discounting, valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer.&lt;ref name=Thaler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thaler |first=R. H. |year=1981 |title=Some Empirical Evidence on Dynamic Inconsistency |journal=Economic Letters |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=201‚Äì207 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(81)90067-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same.

The standard experiment used to reveal a test subject's hyperbolic discounting curve is to compare short-term preferences with long-term preferences. For instance: "Would you prefer a dollar today or three dollars tomorrow?" or "Would you prefer a dollar in one year or three dollars in one year and one day?" It has been claimed that a significant fraction of subjects will take the lesser amount today, but will gladly wait one extra day in a year in order to receive the higher amount instead.&lt;ref name="Thaler" /&gt;  Individuals with such preferences are described as "[[present-biased preferences|present-biased]]".

The most important consequence of hyperbolic discounting is that it creates temporary preferences for small rewards that occur sooner over larger, later ones. Individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal a strong tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time ‚Äì they make choices today that their future self would prefer not to have made, despite knowing the same information. This [[dynamic inconsistency]] happens because hyperbolas distort the relative value of options with a fixed difference in delays in proportion to how far the choice-maker is from those options.&lt;ref name="Laibson1997QJE"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=David Laibson |last=Laibson |first=David |year=1997 |title=Golden Eggs and Hyperbolic Discounting |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=443‚Äì477 |doi=10.1162/003355397555253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
The phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting is implicit in [[Richard Herrnstein]]'s "[[matching law]]", which states that when dividing their time or effort between two non-exclusive, ongoing sources of reward, most subjects allocate in direct proportion to the rate and size of rewards from the two sources, and in inverse proportion to their delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVilliers|first1=P.|last2=Herrnstein|first2=R.J.|title=Toward a law of response strength|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1976|volume=83|pages=1131‚Äì1153|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1131}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, subjects' choices "match" these parameters.

After the report of this effect in the case of delay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chung |first=S. H. |last2=Herrnstein |first2=R. J. |year=1967 |title=Choice and delay of Reinforcement |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=67‚Äì74 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1967.10-67 |pmid=16811307 |pmc=1338319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] pointed out that in a single choice between a larger, later and a smaller, sooner reward, inverse proportionality to delay would be described by a plot of value by delay that had a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic shape]], and that when the smaller, sooner reward is preferred, this preference can be reversed by increasing both rewards' delays by the same absolute amount.  Ainslie's research showed that a substantial number of subjects reported that they would prefer $50 immediately rather than $100 in six months, but would NOT prefer $50 in 3 months rather than $100 in nine months, even though this was the same choice seen at 3 months‚Äô greater distance.  More significantly, those subjects who said they preferred $50 in 3 months to $100 in 9 months  said they would NOT prefer $50 in 12 months to $100 in 18 months‚Äîagain, the same pair of options at a different distance‚Äîshowing that the preference-reversal effect did not depend on the excitement of getting an immediate reward.&lt;ref name=A&amp;H83&gt;Ainslie, George and Haendel, V.

Thomas, pp. 119-140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor does it depend on human culture; the first preference reversal findings were in rats and pigeons.&lt;ref name="Ainslie1974"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=George Ainslie (psychologist) |last=Ainslie |first=G.

A large number of subsequent experiments have confirmed that spontaneous preferences by both human and nonhuman subjects follow a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic curve]] rather than the conventional, [[exponential discounting|exponential]] curve that would produce consistent choice over time.&lt;ref name="Green et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=L. |last2=Fry |first2=A.

However, given the choice between $50 in five years or $100 in six years almost everyone will choose $100 in six years, even though that is the same choice seen at five years' greater distance.

Hyperbolic discounting has also been found to relate to real-world examples of self-control. Indeed, a variety of studies have used measures of hyperbolic discounting to find that drug-dependent individuals discount delayed consequences more than matched nondependent controls, suggesting that extreme delay discounting is a fundamental behavioral process in drug dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bickel |first=Warren K. |last2=Johnson |first2=Matthew W. |year=2003 |chapter=Delay Discounting: A Fundamental Behavioral Process of Drug Dependence |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAOGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA419 |pages=419‚Äì40 |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Loewenstein |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Read |editor3-first=Roy F. |editor3-last=Baumeister |title=Time and Decision |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |isbn=0-87154-549-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madden |first=G.

Likewise, some have suggested that high-rate hyperbolic discounting makes unpredictable ([[gambling]]) outcomes more satisfying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madden |first=G.

The degree of discounting is vitally important in describing hyperbolic discounting, especially in the discounting of specific rewards such as money. The discounting of monetary rewards varies across age groups due to the varying discount rate.&lt;ref name="Green et al"/&gt; The rate depends on a variety of factors, including the species being observed, age, experience, and the amount of time needed to consume the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loewenstein |first=G. |authorlink2=Drazen Prelec |last2=Prelec |first2=D. |year=1992 |title=Choices Over Time |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |isbn=0-87154-558-6 }}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raineri |first=A. |last2=Rachlin |first2=H. |year=1993 |title=The effect of temporal constraints on the value of money and other commodities |journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision-Making |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=77‚Äì94 |doi=10.1002/bdm.3960060202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Several alternative explanations of non-exponential discounting have been proposed. An article from 2003 noted that this pattern might be better explained by a [[similarity heuristic]] than by hyperbolic discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubinstein |first=Ariel |year=2003 |title="Economics and Psychology"? The Case of Hyperbolic Discounting. |journal=International Economic Review |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=1207‚Äì1216 |doi=10.1111/1468-2354.t01-1-00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects have also reported changing relative preferences as they see more details of what they are choosing‚Äîa ‚Äútemporal construal‚Äù effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trope|first1=Yaacov|last2=Liberman|first2=Nira|title=Temporal construal|journal=Psychological Review|date=2003|volume=110|issue=3|pages=403‚Äì421|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.3.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Daniel Read introduces "subadditive discounting": the fact that discounting over a delay increases if the delay is divided into smaller intervals. This hypothesis may explain the main finding of many studies in support of hyperbolic discounting‚Äîthe observation that impatience declines with time‚Äìwhile also accounting for observations not predicted by hyperbolic discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Read |first=Daniel |year=2001 |title=Is time-discounting hyperbolic or subadditive? |journal=Journal of risk and uncertainty |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=5‚Äì32 |doi=10.1023/A:1011198414683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although these observations depart from exponential discounting, they do not entail preference reversal as time from the choice to the earlier reward increases.

Arousal of appetite or emotion does sometimes lead to preference reversal, and this has been the most widely accepted alternative to a simply hyperbolic function: [[hyperboloid]] or quasi-hyperbolic discounting fuses exponential curves with an arousal bump as a visceral reward becomes imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McClure | first1 = Samuel M. | last2 = Laibson | first2 = David I. | last3 = Loewenstein | first3 = George | last4 = Cohen | first4 = Jonathan D. | year = 2004 | title = The grasshopper and the ant: Separate neural systems value immediate and delayed monetary rewards | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = | pages = 503‚Äì507 | doi=10.1126/science.1100907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such cases are obviously important, but still do not account for cases where either both or neither choice is made during arousal.

The most obvious objection to hyperbolic discounting is that many or most people learn to choose consistently over time in most situations. Similarly, a 2014 paper criticized the existing studies for mostly using data collected from university students and being too quick to conclude that the hyperbolic model of discounting is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersen |first1=Steffen |last2=Harrison |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Lau |first3=Morten |last4=Rutstr√∂m |first4=E.

==Mathematical model==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

===Step-by-step explanation===

Suppose that in a study, participants are offered the choice between taking ''x'' dollars immediately or taking ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later.  Suppose further that one participant in that study employs exponential discounting and another employs hyperbolic discounting.

Each participant will realize that ''a'') they should take ''x'' dollars immediately if they can invest the dollar in a different venture that will yield more than ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later and ''b'') they will be indifferent between the choices (selecting one at random) if the best available alternative will likewise yield ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later.  (Assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the values of all available investments are compounded daily.)  Each participant correctly understands the fundamental question being asked:  "For any given value of ''y'' dollars and ''n'' days, what is the minimum amount of money, ''i.e.'', the minimum value for ''x'' dollars, that I should be willing to accept?  In other words, how many dollars would I need to invest today to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now?"  Each will take ''x'' dollars if ''x'' is greater than the answer that they calculate, and each will take ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now if ''x'' is smaller than that answer.  However, the methods that they use to calculate that amount and the answers that they get will be different, and only the exponential discounter will use the correct method and get a reliably correct result:

* The exponential discounter will think "The best alternative investment available (that is, the best investment available in the absence of this choice) gives me a return of ''r'' percent per day; in other words, once a day it adds to its value ''r'' percent of the value that it had the previous day.  That is, every day it multiplies its value once by (100% + ''r''%).  So if I hold the investment for ''n'' days, its value will have multiplied itself by this amount ''n'' times, making that value (100% + ''r''%)^''n'' of what it was at the start ‚Äì that is, (1 + ''r''%)^''n'' times what it was at the start.  So to figure out how much I would need to start with today to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, I need to divide ''y'' dollars by ([1 + ''r''%]^''n'').  If my other choice of how much money to take is greater than this result, then I should take the other amount, invest it in the other venture that I have in mind, and get even more at the end.  If this result is greater than my other choice, then I should take ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, because it turns out that by giving up the other choice I am essentially investing that smaller amount of money to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, meaning that I'm getting an even greater return by waiting ''n'' days for ''y'' dollars, making this my best available investment."
* The hyperbolic discounter, however, will think "If I want ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, then the amount that I need to invest today is ''y'' divided by ''n'', because that amount times ''n'' equals ''y'' dollars.  [There lies the hyperbolic discounter's error.]  If my other choice is greater than this result, I should take it instead because ''x'' times ''n'' will be greater than ''y'' times ''n''; if it is less than this result, then I should wait ''n'' days for ''y'' dollars."

Where the exponential discounter reasons correctly and the hyperbolic discounter goes wrong is that as ''n'' becomes very large, the value of (1 + ''r'' %)^''n'' becomes much larger than the value of ''n'', with the effect that the value of ''y'' / [(1 + ''r'' %)^''n''] becomes much smaller than the value of ''y'' /''n''.  Therefore, the minimum value of ''x'' (the number of dollars in the immediate choice) that suffices to be greater than that amount will be much smaller than the hyperbolic discounter thinks, with the result that they will perceive ''x''-values in the range from ''y'' / [(1 + ''r'' %)^''n''] to ''y''/''n'' (inclusive at the low end) as being too small and, as a result, irrationally turn those alternatives down when they are in fact the better investment.

===Formal model===

Hyperbolic discounting is mathematically described as
:&lt;math&gt;g(D)=\frac{1}{1+kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g''(''D'') is the [[discount factor]] that multiplies the value of the reward, ''D'' is the delay in the reward, and ''k'' is a parameter governing the degree of discounting. This is compared with the formula for exponential discounting:
:&lt;math&gt;f(D)=e^{-kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Comparison====

If &lt;math&gt;f(D)=2^{-D}\,&lt;/math&gt; is an exponential discounting function and &lt;math&gt;g(D)=\frac{1}{1+D}\,&lt;/math&gt; a hyperbolic function (with ''D'' the number of weeks of delay), then the exponential discounting a week later from "now" (''D''=0) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the exponential discounting a week from week ''D'' is &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(D+1)}{f(D)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means they are the same. For ''g''(''D''), &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(1)}{g(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as for ''f'', while &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}=1-\frac{1}{D+2}\,&lt;/math&gt;. From this one can see that the two types of discounting are the same "now", but when ''D'' is much greater than 1, for instance 52 (one year), &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}\,&lt;/math&gt; will tend to go to 1, so that the hyperbolic discounting of a week in the far future is virtually zero, while the exponential discount factor is still 1/2, so there is still substantial discounting in the far future.

===Quasi-hyperbolic approximation===
The "quasi-hyperbolic" discount function, proposed by Laibson (1997),&lt;ref name="Laibson1997QJE"/&gt; approximates the hyperbolic discount function above in [[discrete time]] by

:&lt;math&gt;f_{QH}(0)=1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;f_{QH}(D)=\beta \times \delta^D,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Œ≤'' and ''Œ¥'' are constants between 0 and 1; and again ''D'' is the delay in the reward, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''QH''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') is the discount factor. The condition ''f''(0) = 1 is stating that rewards taken at the present time are not discounted.

Quasi-hyperbolic time preferences are also referred to as "beta-delta" preferences. They retain much of the analytical tractability of [[exponential discounting]] while capturing the key qualitative feature of discounting with true hyperbolas.

==Explanations==

===Uncertain risks===
Whether discounting future gains is rational or not‚Äîand at what rate such gains should be discounted‚Äîdepends greatly on circumstances. Many examples exist in the financial world, for example, where it is reasonable to assume that there is an implicit risk that the reward will not be available at the future date, and furthermore that this risk increases with time. Consider paying $50 for dinner today or delaying payment for sixty years but paying $100,000. In this case, the restaurateur would be reasonable to discount the promised future value as there is significant risk that it might not be paid (e.g. due to the death of the restaurateur or the diner).

Uncertainty of this type can be quantified with [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name="sozou1998"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. D.| title = On hyperbolic discounting and uncertain hazard rates| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| last1 = Sozou| volume = 265| issue = 1409| pages = 2015‚Äì2020| year = 1998| doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0534| pmc = 1689473}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose that the probability for the reward to be available after time ''t'' is, for known hazard rate Œª,
:&lt;math&gt;P(R_t|\lambda) = \exp(-\lambda t),\,&lt;/math&gt;

but the rate is unknown to the decision maker. If the [[prior probability]] distribution of Œª is
:&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda) = \exp(-\lambda/k)/k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then the decision maker will expect that the probability of the reward after time ''t'' is
:&lt;math&gt;P(R_t) = \int_0^\infty P(R_t|\lambda) p(\lambda) d\lambda = \frac{1}{1 + k t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the hyperbolic discount rate. Similar conclusions can be obtained from other plausible distributions for Œª.&lt;ref name="sozou1998"/&gt;

==Applications==
More recently these observations about [[discount function]]s have been used to study [[Retirement#Saving for retirement|saving for retirement]], borrowing on [[credit card]]s, and [[procrastination]].

==Present values of annuities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

===Present value of a standard annuity===

The present value of a series of equal annual cash flows in arrears discounted hyperbolically is

:&lt;math&gt;V = P \frac{\ln(1+kD)}{k},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the present value, ''P'' is the annual cash flow, ''D'' is the number of annual payments and ''k'' is the factor governing the discounting.

[[File:In Situ Bioremediation.png|thumb|In Situ Bioremediation]]
[[Bioremediation]] is the process of decontaminating polluted sites through the usage of either endogenous or external [[microorganism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7R7VX9dLV8oC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=in+situ+bioremediation#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=Rittmann|first=Bruce E.|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780815513483|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[In situ#Environmental remediation|In situ]] is a term utilized within a variety of fields meaning "on site" and refers to the location of an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=situs2|title=Charlton T.

Common polluted sites targeted by bioremediation are groundwater/aquifers and polluted soils. Aquatic [[ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s  affected by oil spills have also shown improvement through the application of bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perelo|first=Louisa Wessels|date=15 May 2010|title=Review: In situ and bioremediation of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389409020792|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=177|issue=1‚Äì3|pages=81‚Äì89|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.12.090|pmid=20138425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable cases being the [[Deepwater Horizon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-clean-up-oil-spills/|title=Slick Solution: How Microbes Will Clean Up the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|last=Biello|first=David|date=|work=Scientific American|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil spill in 2010 and the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlas|first=Ronald M.|last2=Hazen|first2=Terry C.|date=15 August 2011|title=Oil Biodegradation and Bioremediation: A Tale of the Two Worst Spills in U.S. History|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=16|pages=6709‚Äì6715|doi=10.1021/es2013227|issn=0013-936X|pmc=3155281|pmid=21699212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two variations of bioremediation exist defined by the location where the process occurs.

__TOC__

==History==
The Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, [[Pennsylvania]] spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-34-waste-containment-and-remediation-technology-spring-2004/lecture-notes/lecture12.pdf|title=Lecture 12 Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Course Work Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications of In situ Bioremediation ==

===Accelerated===
Accelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as [[benzoate]] and lactate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioprocess.pnnl.gov/resour/rt3d.in.situ.bioremediation.htm#advant|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=bioprocess.pnnl.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David E.|last2=Lutz|first2=Edward J.|last3=Odom|first3=J. Martin|last4=Buchanan|first4=Ronald J.|last5=Bartlett|first5=Craig L.|last6=Lee|first6=Michael D.|last7=Harkness|first7=Mark R.|last8=DeWeerd|first8=Kim A.|date=1 June 2000|title=Bioaugmentation for Accelerated In Situ Anaerobic Bioremediation|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=34|issue=11|pages=2254‚Äì2260|doi=10.1021/es990638e|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed [[bioaugmentation]] and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Raymond Process====
The Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated [[Groundwater]] from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the [[water table]] upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=====Oxygen Injection=====
In contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Aerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/|title=CLU-IN {{!}} Technologies &gt; Remediation &gt; About Remediation Technologies &gt; Bioremediation &gt; Aerobic Bioremediation (Direct)|last=|first=|date=|website=clu-in.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.

====== Ozone Injection ======
Ozone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=====Accelerated Anaerobic In situ Bioremediation=====
Within accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA)===
Monitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf|title=A Citizen's Guide to Monitored Natural Attenuation|last=|first=|date=September 2012|website=Contaminated Sites Clean up Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Uses of In situ bioremediation==
===Hydrocarbon Degradation===

Naturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize [[hydrocarbons]] as a source of energy and Carbon.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bren.ucsb.edu/~keller/courses/esm223/SuthersanCh05Bioremediation.pdf|title=IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION|last=Suthersan|first=Susan|date=1999|website=University of California Barbara|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is [[cometabolism]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The fungus genus [[Phanerochaete]] under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syed|first=Khajamohiddin|last2=Yadav|first2=Jagjit S.|date=1 November 2012|title=P450 monooxygenases (P450ome) of the model white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=339‚Äì363|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2012.682050|issn=1040-841X|pmc=3567848|pmid=22624627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorinated Compounds===
====Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds====

A variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated [[aliphatic compounds]]. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
[[File:Reacciotriclorur.png|thumb|Synthesis and general structure of polychlorinated byphenyls.]]

====Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons====

Chlorinated [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well.  Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade [[biphenyl]] have on PCBs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Due to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.

'''Intimization''' is "a revelatory process which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as [an individuals‚Äôs] personal life ‚Äì broadly defined. It is a [[publicity]] process (involving the media) that takes place over time and involves flows of personal information and imagery into the [media]".&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It has mainly been studied as a society wide process in the context of politics although it can apply to other contexts.

==Definitions==
The term intimization was first used and defined as a process by Van Zoonen in her study of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television news in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  She defines it as a process whereby "values from the private sphere are transferred to the public sphere".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen"&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen not only in the greater focus on ‚Äòhuman interest subjects‚Äô but also in "the way the relation between audience and news reader is constructed... through carefully picked personalities and intimate modes of address".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen" /&gt;

Hirdman [[et al.]] use the term in their study of changes in [[Sweden|Swedish]] journalism from the 1880s. They define intimization as a process which sees increased journalistic attention on the family, sexuality and the private, what they term the ‚Äòintimate sphere‚Äô as opposed to the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Hirdman"&gt;Hirdman, A., Kleberg, M and Widestedt, K. 2005: Intimization of Journalism: Transformations of Medialized Public Spheres from 1880s to Current Times. Nordicom Review, 2 109-117. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that "modes of address, relations to sources, visual representations and focus of texts are seen to interact to create a kind of medial pseudo intimacy."&lt;ref name="Hirdman" /&gt;

The term [[privatization]] has sometimes also been used to signify the same process. Rahat and Sheafer, for example, define privatization as "a media focus on the personal characteristics and personal life of individual candidates."&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of this term is problematic as the word, most commonly associated the sale of state-owned assets, means the reverse, privatizing of something that is public not publicizing the private.

Stanyer argues that Intimization as a process relates primarily to media content formation and dissemination in any society and should not be conflated with [[Parasocial interaction|para-social]] or tele-mediated intimacy between audiences and those who appear on TV.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl, writing in the 1950s were particularly interested in the relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, D. and Whol, R Richard. (1956) Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction: Observations on Intimacy at a Distance. Psychiatry, 19: 215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl were not interested in the information and imagery to which audience members were exposed and made no distinction between the public and private matters but were rather interested in their illusory (para-social) relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. While not downplaying the importance of the audience, Stanyer observes it is the information and imagery to which an audience is exposed that is important in the intimization process. It is the mass exposure of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as the personal / private life of a public figure as opposed to their public/ professional life. Information and imagery we might expect only to be exchanged between those in a close relationship. In other words, public figures (politicians, celebrities, sports stars etc.) are not just familiar to us (that is recognisable) but potentially more information about their personal life circulates in the media, and the audience are exposed to more information from the private lives of public figures. An important distinction is made in this respect between familiarity and intimacy.

Stanyer suggests that flows of information can come from three specific areas or domains of the personal life. ‚ÄòThe first domain concerns the ‚Äòinner life‚Äô of [a person]. This includes, for example, his or her health, well being, sexuality, personal finances, deeds, misdeeds, key milestones (such as birthdays), life experiences and achievements, but also choices about the way an individual wants to live his or her life: for example, life-style choices, ways of behaving, choice of religion or questions of taste. The second domain concerns significant others in a person‚Äôs personal life and his or her relationship with these actors. This includes relationships with partners, other immediate and extended family members, friends and extra-marital lovers. The third domain concerns an individual‚Äôs life space: this includes his or her home but it also includes happenings in locations outside the home where the individual is not performing a public function and might want privacy, such as on family holidays‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Stanyer observes that intimization consists of "the publicizing of information and imagery from these three domains," he also notes such information can enter the public sphere with or without expressed or implied consent of those in public life and can either be [[scandal]]ous in nature (it reveals a transgression of societal norms) or non-scandalous.&lt;ref name="Stanyer"&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the former "might be an act of self-disclosure on a talk show or in an [[autobiography]] which is then recycled in the media." Example of the latter "might include, [[paparazzi]] photographs of politicians backstage or off-duty, taken without the subject‚Äôs permission" revealing an [[extra-marital affair]]&lt;ref name="Stanyer" /&gt;

In sum, drawing on these definitions initimization can be seen as a society wide ‚Äòrevelatory process‚Äô which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from the different domains of public figures‚Äô personal lives, either with or without expressed or implied consent of the individual involved.

==Intimization and the media coverage of conventional politics==
The growing visibility of the private lives of public figures has been much commented on but has received little systematic attention. The findings that emerge are somewhat mixed. Errera analyzed coverage of French politicians‚Äô private lives in two magazines ''[[Paris Match]]'' and ''[[VSD (French magazine)|VSD]]'' over a seven-year period between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Errera C (2006) 'La vie priv√©e des politiques, un tabou de la politique fran√ßaise.' Communication et langages 148(1): 81-102.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that politicians‚Äô relationships, personal health, their home and family life, personal financial issues and their past life were very much to the fore in the magazines‚Äô coverage especially of leading French politicians, such as, [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Fran√ßois Mitterrand]].

In terms of newspaper articles referring to UK national leaders‚Äô personal lives, Langer found a clear upward trend over time.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2007) 'A Historical Exploration of the Personalisation of Politics in the Print Media: The British Prime Ministers 1945‚Äì1999.' Parliamentary Affairs 60(3): 371-387. p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of their private lives rose from around 1% of the leader‚Äôs coverage in 1945 to 8% during [[Tony Blair]]‚Äôs tenure in office (2007). A follow up study (period 2007-2008) showed that the coverage of opposition leader [[David Cameron]] was even more focused on his private life than that of Tony Blair, while that of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was less, suggesting the importance of  specific leaders for the amount of attention their private life receives.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2010) 'The Politicization of Private Persona: Exceptional Leaders or the New Rule? The Case of the United Kingdom and the Blair Effect.' International Journal of Press Politics 15(1): 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rahat and Sheafer, who looked at election coverage in two leading Israeli newspapers for 16 campaigns between 1949 and 2003, found no significant trend in media coverage of candidates‚Äô personal life, with the focus on personal life never exceeding 15% of the news items over time.&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparative research conducted so far by Stanyer found some interesting cross national differences. Looking at non-scandalous and scandalous media coverage in seven democracies (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US) the research found that intimization is more prevalent in the UK and US compared to the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer argues that there is no magic causal [[silver bullet]], such as, new communication technologies, or tabloidization that can explain the difference between countries. Rather, the outcome is the result of a complex interplay of necessary and sufficient factors operating in conjunction. These include: personal factors including the age of the politician, media conditions, such as the size of the [[tabloid press]] and presence and absence of privacy protection for public figures, and political factors, such as the nature of the political system.

In a controlled social experiment if a control is aware of their status as members of the control group and is able to compare their performance with that of the treatment group, members of the control group may actively work harder to overcome the "disadvantage" of being in the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Campbell|first2=Donald Thomas|title=Quasi-experimentation: Design &amp; Analysis Issues for Field Settings|date=1979|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=9780395307908|page=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if in an educational trial where the school classes who are in the treatment receive an extra support teacher, students who are in the control group may be induced to work harder to overcome that disadvantage.

The term was first used by Gary Saretsky (1972) to describe the behavior of  [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], a legendary American steel driver in the 1870s who, when he heard his output was being compared with that of a steam drill, worked so hard to outperform the machine that he died in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saretsky|first1=Gary|title=The OEO P.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2791">The '''law of the case''' is a [[law|legal]] [[term of art]] that is applicable mainly in [[common law]], or Anglo-American, jurisdictions that recognize the related doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]].''  The phrase refers to instances where "rulings made by a trial court and not challenged on appeal become the law of the case." &lt;ref&gt;Hughes v. State  490 A.2d 1034, 1048 (Del.,1985) (citing Haveg Corp. v. Guyer, Del.Supr., 211 A.2d 910, 912 (1965))&lt;/ref&gt; "Unless the trial court's rulings were clearly in error or there has been an important change in circumstances, the court's prior rulings must stand." &lt;ref&gt;Id. citing United States v. Estrada-Lucas, 651 F.2d 1261, 1263 (9th Cir.1980); Smith v. United States, D.C.App., 406 A.2d 1262 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the situation occurs when either a case is on appeal for the second time‚Äî''e.g.'' if the reviewing court remanded the matter to the trial court and the party appeals again or if the case was appealed in a higher [[appellate court]]‚Äîfor example, from an appellate court to the highest court.  

As generally used, "law of the case" states that, if an appellate court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case to the court below for further proceedings, the legal question thus determined by the appellate court will not be differently determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case where the facts remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co.'', 232 N.W.2d 302, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine provides that an appellate court‚Äôs determination on a legal issue is binding on both the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal given the same case and substantially the same facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinds v. McNair'', 413 N.E.2d 586, 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "law of the case" doctrine, however, is one of policy only and will be disregarded when compelling circumstances call for a redetermination of a point of law on prior appeal. This is particularly true where an intervening or a contemporaneous change in law has occurred where former decisions have been overruled or new precedent has been established by controlling authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Ryan v. Mike-Ron Corp.'', 259 Cal.App.2d 91, 96 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "law of the case" doctrine precludes reconsideration of a previously decided issue unless one of three "exceptional circumstances" exists: (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Jefferson'', 31 S.W.3d 558, 561 (Tenn. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Libertarianism Without Inequality''''' is a book written in 2003 by [[Michael Otsuka]], and published by [[Oxford University Press]].

==Synopsis==
The book is written in three parts with part one being dedicated to [[self-ownership]] and "world ownership."&lt;ref name="part III self ownership"&gt;{{cite book|last=Otsuka|first=Michael |title=Libertarianism without Inequality|date=3 July 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-924395-2|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part two dwells on the rights of [[self-defense]] and the right to punish those who transgress against the [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] of others.&lt;ref name="part III self ownership"/&gt; Part three deals with the political aspects and other types of [[libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="part III self ownership"/&gt;

==Reception==
Ian Carter has said, "In this important contribution to rights theory, the deontology of punishment, and the problem of political obligation, Michael Otsuka argues against the belief, prevalent on both the left and the right of the political spectrum, that the fundamental principles of libertarianism conflict with the ideal of economic equality. This allows him to defend ‚Äúlibertarianism without inequality‚Äù ‚Äì a radical and provocative normative construction that is both more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and more libertarian than mainstream ([[Centre-left|left-of-centre]]) [[Social liberalism|liberal]] egalitarianism."&lt;ref name="Ian Carter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1418|title=Libertarianism without Inequality|last=Carter|first=Ian|date=March 9, 2004|publisher=University of Notre Dame|page=1|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] intellectual historian [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] has said, "Michael Otsuka endeavors to combine two fundamental principles of political philosophy, usually considered polar opposites. In my view, his ingenious attempt does not succeed; but his failure has much to teach us."&lt;ref name="David Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://mises.org/library/libertarianism-without-inequality-michael-otsuka|last=Gordon|first=David|date=Fall 2003|title=Is Inequality Indefensible?|journal=The Mises Review|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|volume=9|issue=3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Hinton has said the book is a notable contribution to [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Timothy Hinton"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30043660|last=Hinton|first=Timothy|date=Jan 2005|journal=The Philosophical Review|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=114|issue=1|pages=142‚Äì44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''logovisual technology''' was introduced c. 2000 (Blake, Varney 1999) as a generic description for methods that structure texts to aid thinking.  It arose in relation to a particular history of research and development with applications in education and management.

The structuring of texts considered in LVT is based on distinguishing three kinds of element. These are:

* Elementary units of meaning
* Their combinations
* Their framing

==History==
The particular history began in the 1960s with the invention of [[structural communication]] by [[John G. Bennett]] and his colleagues. Structural Communication was devised to simulate the process of a small group tutorial in higher education. It introduced the generation and use of 'semantic units' relevant to a topic: a given text was articulated into a set of discrete statements. Operations on this set then provided a means of two-way communication based on combinations of the discrete units. The combinations enabled communication of 'information about information' that lent itself to discourse on e.g. the structure of ideas. (Donald McKay defined 'structural information' as information about how to interpret messages ([[N. Katherine Hayles]], 1999).)

Technological implementation of the method was primitive in the 60s. At that time, there were no personal computers, so there were only cumbersome means of performing operations on the discrete units of meaning.

In the 1980s a 'magnetic technology' was introduced.  The 'semantic units' were written onto magnetic objects that could be attached and detached to any number of suitable surfaces. This enabled operations to be done physically. It also enabled them to be perfectly visible to a group of people, thus making it possible for members of a group to work together on the structuring of texts. This suited the needs of many kinds of management group and it was in this context that Centre for Management Creativity continued to develop the method.

In the 2000s a new step was made by recognising the significance of 'framing'; that is, the form of the spaces in which units of meaning were placed and transferred between. Framing lent itself to computer technology in the guise of screens of display. The explicit use of frames enabled the method to go more deeply into the operations of writing and even change what might be considered as writing.

==Intellectual technology==
The position taken is that 'thinking' cannot be directly addressed by any technology, only the tangible operations or productions that stem from it, [[writing]] in particular. LVT is an intellectual technology (Warfield, 1976) that aims to streamline mental operations by facilitating recurrent actions of writing. By isolating such recurrent actions, and making them simpler and easier to execute, it is supposed that the [[mind]] is freed to be more creative.

"It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], An Introduction to Mathematics

An intellectual technology makes certain operations explicit and therefore amenable to becoming more efficient. Such operations occur without any such technology in the ordinary process of thinking but are only implicit and therefore often confused and liable to interfere with each other. As an intellectual technology, LVT follows the principle of performing only one action at any one time. It separates operations into distinct times and places. [[John N. Warfield]] has described this separation conjecture as follows (Societal Systems, p.&amp;nbsp;63):

"Modeling may often be done by groups of individuals, contributing their own special knowledge to the development of a model. But human behavior in groups often involves a random mixing and overlapping of idea actions. Such random mixing does not lend itself to methodology that seeks to strengthen, sharpen, and facilitate each individual idea action. Instead the burden of attaining productivity tends to fall heavily on group leadership. This often creates an unmanageable situation which frustrates productivity. The separation conjecture speaks to this situation as follows: GREATER INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY BOTH GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH CONSCIOUS SEPARATION OF MENTAL ACTIVITY INTO DISTINCT IDEA ACTIONS, EACH BEING CARRIED OUT WITH METHODOLOGY ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE TO IT. Separation facilitates the development of associations and transformations needed for model development and application."
	
An intellectual technology can be seen as a special variant of the idea of [[artificial intelligence]], but only in the sense of a facilitating mechanism for the thinking of humans rather than as an independent entity that 'thinks' in its own terms. LVT in particular bears some affinity to the [[Turing Machine]] and can be considered as analogous with it. In brief, a Turing machine is based on a linear tape that moves back and forth under a reading and writing head; while in LVT use is made of surfaces (or frames) in which material can be written in two dimensions. Data in the form of units of meaning can be written into spaces and moved or copied from them into other spaces but this requires human operators.

LVT is thus a technology that refines and amplifies what humans do, taking the place of a [[facilitator]]. This possibility has been explored in other directions such as in research into 'dialogue games' (Ravenscroft &amp; Pilkington, 2000):

"Levin &amp; Moore (1997) used the term dialogue-game to characterise observable patterns in human dialogue, which they called "Metacommunication Structures for Natural Language Interaction". Examples of their games include Helping, Information-seeking, Information-probing and Instructing. A more prescriptive approach to dialogue games has been proposed by Mackenzie (1979), Carlson (1983) and Hintikka (1984), that have been reviewed by Walton (1984). This category of game assigns participant roles, specify goals of the interaction, and include rules that govern permissible dialogue moves for participants. Rules also specify the influence of moves on commitment stores, turn-taking and who has the initiative."

Dialogue games are one type of meaning game, games based on the meaning of elements that are constructed into new meanings by their conjunctions. One example of this corpus is known, after [[Herman Hesse]], as the [[Glass Bead Game]]. Another striking example is [[1000 blank white cards]] which can be viewed as an unconstrained form of LVT. Studies of the general principles of meaning games have been incorporated into LVT ([[A. G. E. Blake]], 2008).

==Formal operations of writing in LVT==
The formal operations of LVT derive from those discernible in any instance of 'writing from thinking'.

In ordinary writing, text is produced linearly on the horizontal and lines are contingently arranged in stacks, vertically. In poetry, lines have their own intrinsic length and are clearly separated vertically. In technical fields, it is a common practice to write ideas or statements vertically as in bullet points.

There are arbitrary constraints of size of page.

Chunks of text are divided up as in the conventions of the [[paragraph]]. There are useful devices such as headings that can title a chunk of text or a set of chunks.

These familiar structures are refined to enable the systemic approach of LVT.

The writing of text is subject to various types of order.

# Text is articulated into discrete units called 'molecules of meaning' (MMs) that can be treated as distinct objects.
# MMs are arrayed according to different types of order such as:
#* In series
#* In stacks
#* In [[finite set|sets]]
# MMs and/or their combinations (in orders) are placed in different frames. A frame is a bounded two-dimensional surface that can contain a number of MMs and has its own meaning.

'Writing' is not only the production of words but includes the movement of MMs from one frame to another. The meaning of any MM is dependent not only on what it states but also on what other MMs it is combined with and what kind of frame it is situated in. A frame is analogous to a [[frame of reference]] as used in physics.

The arbitrary character of the written page is replaced by a set of operations within a system that follows the intrinsic meaning of what is being said to produce an intentionally structured text. It is therefore akin to poetry and mathematics.

==Comprehension of text==
[[Reading (process)|Reading]] and writing have some correlation with [[intelligence]]. It appears, for example, that reading classical texts can at least temporarily increase intelligence because they are highly coherent in their composition. LVT focuses on the operations that create structure. It is a compositional technique that also aids intelligent reading.

The [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] of text or reading involves many levels from visual acuity to intellectual grasp of complex arguments. LVT takes into account that in any one 'moment' of an act of comprehension a reader can grasp only four or five items, but also makes use of the fact that the items can range from single characters to whole sections of text. What an 'item' ‚Äì in LVT terminology, an MM ‚Äì consists of can change from frame to frame.

The forming and handling of small groups of MMs on one level as one new kind of MM on another level is a critical operation. Such 'chunks' can be further chunked. The steps involved can be handled by the use of different frames.

In reading, there is both an immediate sense of a chunk on a certain level and also a 'background' sense of chunking on many levels. The background sense extends to what is sometimes called the [[wikt:Special:Search/synoptic|synoptic]] sense of the whole text. There is both a movement from the most immediate and detailed parts of the text to build towards the whole, and also from the most all-embracing view towards the detail or specifics. It is the synoptic view that provides for a frame of reference within which 'smaller' MMs can be located. The structure of the synoptic view is not identical with the sequential order of exposition. It might even be called 'unconscious'.

As reading proceeds, what has been read ceases to be immediate and becomes 'latent'. By rendering MMs visible and capable of being stored in various frames they are made more accessible than relying on memory for re-viewing in the various contexts of other MMs.

The pragmatics of dealing in effect with only four or five MMs at a time is followed through in all the operations of LVT.

The relations between MMs on the different levels are multiple in kind and can never be reduced to any precise set of defined operations. The movement of these relations through various mental operations can be identified with [[thinking]]. LVT, like any technology, can only deal with relations that can be made visible and operations that are made tangible. But by improving on what can be dealt with in such a way, there can be an enablement of [[higher order thinking skills]]. In this guise, LVT has begun to attract the attention of educationists.

LVT also incorporates visual and [[kinesthetic]] elements that can assist children who are not at ease with verbal intelligence alone. The intellectual chunking of MMs is paralleled with a physical separation and placement. An important component of the information processed through LVT is [[topological]].

==Transformations==
The critical constraint in the system is to operate within a given set of elements (MMs) such that the same elements are structured in a series of ways, or are transformed. The central thesis of LVT is that new meaning can be generated out of sets of discrete elements (MMs) through combination and framing. This constitutes a form of rewriting. The structure of LVT is analogous to some mathematical structures, but is less rigorous. [[Analogy]] and analogical thinking in general plays a major role in LVT by providing exemplars of ways of interpretation such as of text, images or diagrams.

At its core is the property of the mind to take a set of many items as one item, sometimes called [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Such an operation is analogous to a mapping or [[conceptual metaphor]] or a [[transform (mathematics)]] and contains the kind of identity that can be expressed as N = 1, where N is the number of distinct MMs contained in the set and the 1 is the singular MM that expresses the reason for the grouping. Hence the singular new MM can be used to signify the whole group it names in further operations.

The three main types of transformation utilised in LVT are:
# Originate. A given 'text' written in the ordinary continuous and linear manner is broken down and expressed clearly in a set of MMs. MMs are statements that are e.g. statements of fact, assertions, or propositions, etc. This distinguishes LVT from such practices as [[brainstorming]] and [[mindmapping]]. Often there is no apparent text but simply reference to 'memory' and 'imagination' or just 'thinking about something'. The idea of a text is used in a very generalised way.
# Combinate. The MMs are combined into sub-sets each of which can be identified with a distinct new meaning. The operation is called 'combinate' to emphasise its active character in organising ideas. It is distantly related to the mathematical structure of [[combinatorial hierarchy]] and more particularly to the study of multi-term systems introduced by John G. Bennett's [[systematics]].
# Integrate. These sub-sets are integrated together into a single [[composition (language)]]. The verb 'to integrate' is used analogously with mathematical or computer usage as in producing the area under a linear curve, or as in [[system integration]]. The sub-sets are formed into serial order to produce a 'curve' that contains their order and content.

These three correspond to structures used in ordinary writing though not identical:
# MMs correspond to sentences
# Combined MMs correspond to paragraphs
# Complete structures of MMs correspond to sections or chapters.

The arc of the total process begins in the relatively unstructured text and ends in a new version of the text. The final text can be written in standard form but will have underlying it a structure that renders it better formed.

==Integrative text==
Thinking in writing produces a series of ideas but also concerns connections of ideas transcendental to the series. The latter need to be recognised and articulated in their own right. It is often the relation of ideas that is more important than the ideas themselves.

This was addressed in the ancient method of [[ring composition]]. As explained by the anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]], the method involved [[narrative]] or [[expository writing]] as if arranged in a circle. The symmetry of the conceptual arrangement naturally divided the discourse into two halves that mirrored each other. The axis of division ran 'internally to the circle' from what Douglas and other scholars call the latch, which unites beginning and end to the turn, which is the pivot or central meaning of the whole. (An example is Homer's [[Iliad]] that 'turns' at the third night of the story). A reader capable of looking into the text as in such a circle was able to reflect on the cross-connections across the circle. Such connections could be made to contain the most significant ideas, though they would necessarily involve the active participation of the reader to make them appear.

In LVT, it is possible for people to rewrite their texts in such a form. This form enables them to reflect on 'inner connections' and generate new meanings; but also to experiment with and improve the [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] of the text in doing so. It is, therefore, a method of composition of structured texts.

There are parallels between LVT ring composition and ideas of [[dramatic structure]] such as the sequence of [[Gustav Freytag]]'s pyramid: exposition‚Äîrising action‚Äîclimax (or turning point)‚Äîfalling action‚Äîd√©nouement.

Integrative texts are also figured in systems diagrams but the literary form of ring composition is preferred because it highlights the inner connections and it does this in a simple way.

An integrative text can be used to generate new meanings. It becomes a thinking apparatus that is more than a summation of previous thoughts.

==Thinking in groups==
The LVT method can be used by an individual but also has utility for 'thinking in groups'. The reasons for this can be summarised:
# All members of the group work with the same 'common' language.
# Their thinking operations are rendered visible to each other.
# Texts are produced that can encode and store information about their [[dialogue]].

The LVT process promotes [[democracy]] in the guise of equal participation, [[transparency (humanities)]] and the allied concept of [[emergence]].

It contains free-floating conversation and association by enabling members of a group to verify that they are talking about the same thing; that is, to ground the conversation in shared, concrete and visible objects. It can be related to [[free association (psychology)]] but only in such contexts as social dreaming where the primary task is to generate new thinking.

Another link with psychology and the humanities is through the idea of the matrix as first described by [[S. H. Foulkes]] as:

"The hypothetical web of communication and relationship in a given group. It is the common shared ground that ultimately determines the meaning and significance of all events and upon which all communications and interpretations verbal and non-verbal rest."

The 'structured text' that can be produced by a group using LVT must be a representation of the matrix of the group. It is allied to reflective consciousness and self-knowledge, or [[metacognition]].

LVT is a form of [[Sensemaking (information science)|sensemaking]]. It enables the rewriting of the 'story of the situation' to better articulate meaningful connections between 'molecules of meaning' such as events and people in conditions of ambiguity that challenge current representations. Sensemaking is a two-way process between 'data' (as MMs) and frames of reference to articulate intelligent trajectories into the future.

==Language, vision and touch (LVT)==
The LVT framing of text forms a bridge between different modes of information-processing, such as first suggested by [[Roger Wolcott Sperry]] in terms of a contrast between left and right hemispheres of the brain. The left brain is dominantly linear, abstract, and verbal while the right is dominantly holistic, sensory, and pictorial. There may be conjectured to be three or more 'brains' to include a third, for example, devoted to handling physical objects in concrete space. The principle of three brains is encoded in the acronym LVT as 'language, vision and touch'.

The precise, distinct steps of LVT which can be given exact algorithms are in practice interleaved with aspects of right brain performance. In terms of left brain thinking, these aspects are 'random' and have no logic. They concern seeing patterns and their meanings and they cannot be reduced to set rules. 'Combinate' makes no sense to the left brain besides being an efficient means of reducing complexity. Its positive content is only understood in the right brain.

The framing of text involves an elementary kind of drawing in that the arrangement of MMs and their combinations is both aesthetic and expressive. It is not putting ideas into pictures but seeing their relations through making shapes combining them.

The 'third brain' of physical sensory-movement gives us access to the organised dynamism of physical and animate objects and such objects ‚Äì also their environments ‚Äì can provide templates of understanding or forms of Integration. In this mode, they take the role of amplifications such as arise in psychotherapy which provide structure to contain and augment what has emerged by free association.

In LVT, it is the 'third brain' that enables a constructive relation between left and right or linguistic and visual brains. In its strict sense, LVT does not allow for extension of the visual into a 'drawing one's thought' ([[Betty Edwards]], 1986) and such a process would have to be introduced independently: learning how to draw one's thoughts could contribute to fostering ability in combinating.

==Historical links==
Aspects of LVT are to be found in [[megalithic]] constructions, with their stones, alignments and circles which relate to patterns of number in the cosmos (Heath, 2005). This relates to LVT through the later textual device of ring composition. [[Ramon Llull]]'s wheels and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s [[characteristica universalis]], often considered to be forerunners of computer science, were also prime examples of technologies of combinating.

[[Frances Yates]]'s study of the 'theatre of memory' from classical to Renaissance times describes the organisation of knowledge through spatial visualisations. The [[Bektashi]] practice of making pictures out of calligraphy illustrates the principle of putting text into shapes. In a different mode, the [[Bauhaus]] school included exercises in sensory and spatial language.

'''Magical thinking''' is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]], denoting the [[non causa pro causa|fallacious attribution]] of [[causality|causal relationships]] between actions and events, with subtle differences in meaning between the two fields. In anthropology, it denotes the attribution of causality between entities [[Grouped Events|grouped]] with one another ([[coincidence]]) or similar to one another. 
In [[psychology]], the entities between which a causal relation has to be posited are more strictly delineated; here it denotes the belief that one's thoughts by themselves can bring about effects in the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Andrew M. |last= Colman |title= A Dictionary of Psychology |edition= 3rd |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the belief can cause a person to experience fear, seemingly not rationally justifiable to an observer outside the belief system, of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because of an assumed [[correlation]] between doing so and threatening calamities.

==Anthropology==
In [[religion]], [[folk religion]], and [[superstition|superstitious]] [[belief]]s, the posited causality is between religious [[ritual]], [[prayer]], [[sacrifice]], or the observance of a [[taboo]], and an expected benefit or recompense. The use of a lucky item or ritual, for example, is assumed to increase the probability that one will perform at a level so that one can achieve a desired goal or outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Hamerman|first= Eric J.|last2= Morewedge|first2= Carey K.|date= 2015-03-01|title= Reliance on Luck Identifying Which Achievement Goals Elicit Superstitious Behavior|url= http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/3/323|journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language= en|volume= 41|issue= 3|pages= 323‚Äì335|doi= 10.1177/0146167214565055|issn= 0146-1672|pmid= 25617118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have identified two possible principles as the formal causes of the attribution of false causal relationships:

* the [[Post hoc ergo propter hoc | temporal contiguity of two events]]
* "associative thinking", the association of entities based upon their semblance to one another

Prominent [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theorists identified associative thinking (a common feature of practitioners of magic) as a characteristic form of irrationality. As with all forms of magical thinking, association-based and similarities-based notions of causality are not always said to be the practice of magic by a magician. For example, the [[doctrine of signatures]] held that similarities between plant parts and body parts indicated their efficacy in treating diseases of those body parts, and was a part of Western medicine during the [[Middle age|Middle Ages]]. This association-based thinking is a vivid example of the general human application of the [[representativeness heuristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Nisbet | first1= D. | last2= Ross | first2= L. | year= 1980 |title= Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment | publisher= Prentice Hall | location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ | pages= 115‚Äì8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] coined the term "associative thinking", characterizing it as pre-logical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Glucklich |first = Ariel |title = The End of Magic |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1997 |pages = 32‚Äì3 |ref= {{Harvid|Glucklich|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date= May 2015}} in which the "magician's folly" is in mistaking an imagined connection with a real one. The magician believes that thematically linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Evans-Pritchard |first = E. E. |authorlink = E. E. Evans-Pritchard |title = Theories of Primitive Religion |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1977 |pages = 26‚Äì7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s account, members of the [[Azande]] tribe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Evans-Pritchard |first = E. E. |authorlink = E. E. Evans-Pritchard |title = Witchcraft, Magic, and Oracles Among the Azande |location = Oxford |publisher = [[Oxford University Press| Clarendon Press]] |year = 1937 |ref= {{harvid|Evans-Pritchard|1937}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that rubbing crocodile teeth on banana plants can invoke a fruitful crop. Because crocodile teeth are curved (like bananas) and grow back if they fall out, the Azande observe this similarity and want to impart this capacity of regeneration to their bananas. To them, the rubbing constitutes a means of transference.

[[Sir James Frazer]] (1854-1941) elaborated upon Tylor's principle by dividing magic into the categories of [[sympathetic magic#Similarity and contagion|sympathetic and contagious magic]]. The latter is based upon the [[law of contagion]] or contact, in which two things that were once connected retain this link and have the ability to affect their supposedly related objects, such as harming a person by harming a lock of his hair. Sympathetic magic and [[homeopathy]] operate upon the premise that "like affects like", or that one can impart characteristics of one object to a similar object. Frazer believed that some individuals think the entire world functions according to these mimetic, or homeopathic, principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Frazer | first= James | title= The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion | origyear= 1911 | year= 1915 | edition= 3rd | location= London | publisher= Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How Natives Think'' (1925), [[Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl]] describes a similar notion of mystical, "collective representations". He too sees magical thinking as fundamentally different from a [[Western world|Western]] style of thought. He asserts that in these representations, "primitive" people's "mental activity is too little differentiated for it to be possible to consider ideas or images of objects by themselves apart from the emotions and passions which evoke those ideas or are evoked by them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= L√©vy-Bruhl | first= Lucien | authorlink= Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl | title= How Natives Think | year= 1925 | publisher= Knopf  | page= 36 | ref={{Harvid|L√©vy-Bruhl|1925}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; L√©vy-Bruhl explains that natives commit the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' [[Deductive fallacy|fallacy]], in which people observe that x is followed by y, and conclude that x has caused y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|L√©vy-Bruhl|1925|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that this fallacy is institutionalized in native culture and is committed regularly and repeatedly.

Despite the view that magic is less than rational and entails an inferior concept of causality, in ''The Savage Mind'' (1966), [[Claude L√©vi-Strauss]] suggested that magical procedures are relatively effective in exerting control over the environment. This outlook has generated alternative theories of magical thinking, such as the symbolic and psychological approaches, and softened the contrast between "educated" and "primitive" thinking: "Magical thinking is no less characteristic of our own mundane intellectual activity than it is of Zande curing practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Richard A. |last1=Shweder |title= Likeness and likelihood in everyday thought: Magical thinking in judgments about personality |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 18 |issue= 4 |year= 1977 |pages= 637‚Äì58 (637) |jstor= 2741505 |doi=10.1086/201974}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The [[Azande]] practice of curing epilepsy by eating the burnt skull of a red bush monkey, based on the apparent similarity of epileptic movements and those of the monkeys, was discussed in {{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1937||page= 487}}.
}}

== Other forms ==
[[Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski]]'s ''Magic, Science and Religion'' (1954) discusses another type of magical thinking, in which words and sounds are thought to have the ability to directly affect the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 59‚Äì61, 205‚Äì12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of [[wish fulfillment]] thinking can result in the avoidance of talking about certain subjects ("speak of the devil and he'll appear"), the use of [[euphemisms]] instead of certain words, or the belief that to know the "true name" of something gives one power over it, or that certain chants, prayers, or mystical phrases will bring about physical changes in the world. More generally, it is magical thinking to take a [[symbol]] to be its referent or an [[analogy]] to represent an identity.

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that magical thinking was produced by [[cognitive development]]al factors. He described practitioners of magic as projecting their mental states onto the world around them, similar to a common phase in child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 53‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From toddlerhood to early school age, children will often link the outside world with their internal consciousness, e.g. "It is raining because I am sad."

== Symbolic approach to magic ==
Another theory of magical thinking is the symbolic approach. Leading thinkers of this category, including [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Stanley J. Tambiah]], believe that magic is meant to be expressive, rather than instrumental. As opposed to the direct, mimetic thinking of Frazer, Tambiah asserts that magic utilizes abstract analogies to express a desired state, along the lines of [[metonymy]] or [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Michael F. |title= Thinking About Magic |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 1993 |pages= 5‚Äì7 |ref={{Harvid|Brown|1993}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important question raised by this interpretation is how mere symbols could exert material effects. One possible answer lies in [[John L. Austin]]'s concept of "[[performativity]]," in which the act of saying something makes it true, such as in an inaugural or marital rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 60‚Äì2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories propose that magic is effective because symbols are able to affect internal psycho-physical states. They claim that the act of expressing a certain anxiety or desire can be reparative in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 49‚Äì53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological functions of magic ==
[[Image:Laying on of hands.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A healing ritual (the [[laying on of hands]])]]
Some scholars believe that [[Psychological theories of magic|magic is effective psychologically]]. They cite the [[Placebo|placebo effect]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Somatoform disorder|psychosomatic disease]] as prime examples of how our mental functions exert power over our bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|pp= 50‚Äì68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]] suggests that engaging in magical practices surrounding healing can relieve anxiety, which could have a significant positive physical effect. In the absence of advanced health care, such effects would play a relatively major role, thereby helping to explain the persistence and popularity of such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African traditional thought and western science: Part I. From tradition to science |journal= [[Africa (journal)|Africa]]: Journal of the [[International African Institute]] |year= 1967 |volume= 37 |issue= 1 |pages= 50‚Äì71 |jstor= 1157195 |ref= {{Harvid|Horton|1967a}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African traditional thought and western science: Part II. The 'closed' and 'open' predicaments |journal= [[Africa (journal)|Africa]]: Journal of the [[International African Institute]] |year= 1967 |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= 155‚Äì87 |jstor= 1158253 |ref= {{Harvid|Horton|1967b}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and few logical or scientific responses to such danger. Magic is used to restore a sense of control over circumstance. In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Keinan |first= Giora |title= The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 102‚Äì108|year = 2002 |doi=  10.1177/0146167202281009|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Keinan |first= Giora |title= The effects of stress and tolerance of ambiguity on magical thinking |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 67 |issue=  1 |pages= 48‚Äì55 |year= 1994 |doi=  10.1037/0022-3514.67.1.48 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential reason for the persistence of magic rituals is that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boyer |first= Pascal |authorlink= Pascal Boyer |last2= Li√©nard |first2= Pierre |title= Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume= 17 |issue= 4 |pages= 291‚Äì94 |year= 2008 |doi=  10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00592.x |accessdate= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.503.1537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer|Boyer]] and Li√©nard propose that in [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals ‚Äî a possible clinical model for certain forms of magical thinking ‚Äî focus shifts to the lowest level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface. The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; Alternatively, some cases of harmless "rituals" may have positive effects in bolstering intent, as may be the case with certain pre-game exercises in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why Rituals Work|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-rituals-work/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phenomenological approach ==
[[Ariel Glucklich]] tries to understand magic from a subjective perspective, attempting to comprehend magic on a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[wikt:experiential|experiential]]ly based level. Glucklich seeks to describe the attitude that magical practitioners feel which he calls "magical consciousness" or the "magical experience." He explains that it is based upon "the awareness of the interrelatedness of all things in the world by means of simple but refined sense perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glucklich|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenological model is that of [[Gilbert Lewis (anthropologist)|Gilbert Lewis]], who argues that "habit is unthinking." He believes that those practicing magic do not think of an explanatory theory behind their actions any more than the average person tries to grasp the pharmaceutical workings of aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Gilbert |title= The Look of Magic |publisher= University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the average person takes an aspirin, he does not know how the medicine chemically functions. He takes the pill with the premise that there is proof of efficacy. Similarly, many who avail themselves of magic do so without feeling the need to understand a [[causal]] theory behind it.

== Idiomatic difference ==
[[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]] maintains that the difference between the thinking of Western and of non-Western peoples is predominantly "[[idiomatic]]". He asserts that the members of both cultures use the same practical common-sense, and that both science and magic are ways beyond basic logic by which people formulate theories to explain whatever occurs. However, non-Western cultures use the idiom of magic and have community spiritual figures, and therefore non-Westerners turn to magical practices or to a specialist in that idiom. Horton sees the same logic and common-sense in all cultures, but notes that their contrasting [[ontological]] idioms lead to cultural practices which seem illogical to observers whose own culture has correspondingly contrasting norms. He explains, "[T]he layman's grounds for accepting the models propounded by the scientist are often no different from the young African villager's ground for accepting the models propounded by one of his elders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horton|1967b|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along similar lines, [[Michael F. Brown]] argues that the [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]] of Peru see magic as a type of technology, no more supernatural than their physical tools. Brown says that the Aguaruna utilize magic in an empirical manner; for example, they discard any magical stones which they have found to be ineffective. To Brown‚Äîas to Horton‚Äîmagical and scientific thinking differ merely in idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Michael F. |title= Tsewa's Gift: Magic and Meaning in an Amazonian Society |publisher= [[University of Alabama Press]] |year= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories blur the boundaries between [[Magic_(paranormal)#Theories_on_the_relationship_of_magic.2C_science.2C_art.2C_and_religion|magic, science, and religion]], and focus on the similarities in magical, technical, and spiritual practices. Brown even ironically writes that he is tempted to disclaim the existence of 'magic.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substantive difference ==
One theory of substantive difference is that of the open versus closed society. Horton describes this as one of the key dissimilarities between traditional thought and Western science. He suggests that the scientific worldview is distinguished from a magical one by the [[scientific method]] and by [[skepticism]], requiring the [[falsifiability]] of any scientific hypothesis. He notes that for native peoples "there is no developed awareness of alternatives to the established body of theoretical texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horton |first= Robin |authorlink= Robin W.G. Horton |title= African thought and western science |journal= Rationality |page= 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that all further differences between traditional and Western thought can be understood as a result of this factor. He says that because there are no alternatives in societies based on magical thought, a theory does not need to be objectively judged to be valid.

==In children==
Magical thinking is most prominent in children between ages 2 and 7. During this age, children strongly believe that their personal thoughts have a direct effect on the rest of the world. Therefore, if they experience something tragic that they do not understand, e.g. a death, their minds will create a reason to feel responsible. [[Jean Piaget]], a [[developmental psychologist]], came up with a theory of four [[Child development stages|developmental stages]]. Children between ages 2 and 7 would be classified under his [[preoperational stage]] of development. During this stage children are still developing their use of [[logical thinking]]. A child's thinking is dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has gone away, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore. Magical thinking would be evident here, since the child may believe that the family pet being gone is just temporary. Their young minds in this stage do not understand the finality of death and magical thinking may bridge the gap.

===Grieving children===
Children who evidence magical thinking often feel that they are responsible for an event or events occurring or are capable of reversing an event simply by thinking about it and wishing for a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nielson |first= D. |year= 2012 |title= Discussing death with pediatric patients: Implications for nurses |journal= Journal of Pediatric Nursing |volume= 27 |pages= e59-e64 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2011.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Make-believe and fantasy are an integral part of life at this age and are often used to explain the inexplicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Samide |first1= L. |last2= Stockton |first2= R. |year= 2002 |title= Letting go of grief: Bereavement groups for children in the school setting |journal= Journal for Specialists in Group Work |volume= 27 |pages= 192‚Äì204 |doi=10.1177/0193392202027002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Webb |first= N. |year= 2010 |chapter= The Child and Death |editor-first= N.B. |editor-last= Webb |title= Helping Bereaved Children: A Handbook for Practitioners |pages= 5‚Äì6 |location= New York |publisher= Guildford |ref= {{Harvid|Webb|2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Piaget, children within this age group are often "[[egocentric]]," believing that what they feel and experience is the same as everyone else's feelings and experiences.&lt;ref name = Biank&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Biank |first1= N. |last2= Werner-Lin |first2= A. |year= 2011 |title= Growing up with grief: Revisiting the death of a parent over the life course |journal= Omega |volume= 63 |pages= 271‚Äì90 |doi=10.2190/om.63.3.e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this age, there is often a lack of ability to understand that there may be other explanations for events outside of the realm of things they have already comprehended. What happens outside their understanding needs to be explained using what they already know, because of an inability to fully comprehend abstract concepts.&lt;ref name = Biank /&gt;

Magical thinking is found particularly in children's explanations of experiences about death, whether the death of a family member or pet, or their own illness or impending death. These experiences are often new for a young child, who at that point has no experience to give understanding of the ramifications of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2010|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child may feel that they are responsible for what has happened, simply because they were upset with the person who died, or perhaps played with the pet too roughly. There may also be the idea that if the child wishes it hard enough, or performs just the right act, the person or pet may choose to come back, and not be dead any longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schoen |first1= A. |last2= Burgoyen |first2= M. |last3= Schoen |first3= S. |year= 2004 |title= Are the developmental needs of children in America adequately addressed during the grief process? |journal= Journal of Instructional Psychology |volume= 31 |pages= 143‚Äì8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering their own illness or impending death, some children may feel that they are being punished for doing something wrong, or not doing something they should have, and therefore have become ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schonfeld |first= D. |year= 1993 |title= Talking with children about death |journal= Journal of Pediatric Health Care |volume= 7 |pages= 269‚Äì74 |doi=10.1016/s0891-5245(06)80008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child's ideas about an event are incorrect because of their magical thinking, there is a possibility that the conclusions the child makes could result in long-term beliefs and behaviours that create difficulty for the child as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sossin |first1= K. |last2= Cohen |first2= P. |year= 2011 |title= Children's play in the wake of loss and trauma |journal= Journal of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy |volume= 10 |pages= 255‚Äì72 |doi=10.1080/15289168.2011.600137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mahavakyas''' (''sing.:'' mahƒÅvƒÅkyam, ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç; ''plural:'' mahƒÅvƒÅkyƒÅni, ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§ø) are "The Great Sayings" of the [[Upanishads]], as characterized by the [[Advaita]] school of [[Vedanta]].

Most commonly, ''Mahavakyas'' are considered four in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1441|title=Meditation on Mahavakyas|website=www.sivanandaonline.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swamij.com/mahavakyas.htm|title=Mahavakyas: Great Contemplations of Advaita Vedanta|website=www.swamij.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four principal Mahavakyas==
Though there are many Mahavakyas, four of them, one from each of the four [[Vedas]], are often mentioned as "the Mahavakyas".{{sfn|Saraswati|1995|p=4}} According to the Vedanta-tradition, the subject matter and the essence of all Upanishads is the same, and all the Upanishadic Mahavakyas express this one universal message in the form of terse and concise statements.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In later Sanskrit usage, the term ''mahƒÅvƒÅkya'' came to mean "discourse", and specifically, discourse on a philosophically lofty topic.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.lisindia.net/Sanskrit/Sanskrit_struct.html Sanskrit Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition the four  Upanishadic statements indicate the ultimate [[unio mystica|unity]] of the individual ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) with Supreme ([[Brahman]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The Mahavakyas are:
#'''praj√±ƒÅnam brahma''' - "Praj√±ƒÅna{{refn|group=note|"Consciousness",{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=234}}&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu"&gt;[http://www.jiddu-krishnamurti.net/en/1969/1969-07-26-jiddu-krishnamurti-can-one-experience-the-infinite Jiddu Krishnamurti, ''Saanen 2nd Conversation with Swami Venkatesananda 26th July 1969'']&lt;/ref&gt; "intelligence",{{sfn|Sivaraman|1973|p=146}}{{sfn|Braue|1984|p=80}} "wisdom"&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy" /&gt;}} is Brahman"{{refn|group=note|"The Absolute",{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=234}}&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt; "infinite",&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt; "the Highest truth"&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt;}}, or "Brahman is [[Prajna (Vedic)|Praj√±ƒÅna]]"&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy"&gt;[http://hinduism.enacademic.com/479/mahavakyas Encyclopedy of Hinduism, ''Mahavakyas'']&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 of the [[Rig Veda]])

People who are initiated into [[sannyasa]] in [[Advaita Vedanta]] are being taught the four [principal] mahavakyas as four mantras, "to attain this highest of states in which the individual self dissolves inseparably in [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part5/chap30.htm kamakoti.org, ''The Upanisads'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Several translations, and word-orders of these translations, are possible:

'''Praj√±ƒÅnam''':
* ''j√±ƒÅ'' can be translated as "consciousness", "knowledge", or "understanding."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "j&amp;ntilde;a," p. 425 (retrieved 14 Aug. 2012 from "Cologne U." at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms are ''[[jnana|j√±ƒÅna]]'', ''praj√±ƒÅ'' and ''praj√±am'', "pure consciousness".{{sfn|Ra·πÖganƒÅthƒÅnanda|1991|p=109}} Although the common translation of ''j√±ƒÅnam''{{sfn|Ra·πÖganƒÅthƒÅnanda|1991|p=109}} is "consciousness", the term has a broader meaning of "knowing"; "becoming acquainted with",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam"&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+jnanam&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary, ''jnanam'']&lt;/ref&gt; "knowledge about anything",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt; "awareness",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt; "higher knowledge".&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt;

Most interpretations state: "Praj√±ƒÅnam (noun) is Brahman (adjective)". Some translations give a reverse order, stating "Brahman is Praj√±ƒÅnam",&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy" /&gt;  specifically "Brahman (noun) is Praj√±ƒÅnam (adjective)": "The Ultimate Reality is wisdom (or consciousness)".&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy" /&gt;

Sahu explains:
{{quote|''Prajnanam iti Brahman'' - wisdom is the soul/spirit. ''Prajnanam'' refers to the intuitive truth which can be verified/tested by reason. It is a higher function of the intellect that ascertains the ''Sat'' or Truth in the ''Sat-Chit-Ananda'' or truth-consciousness-bliss, i.e. the ''Brahman/Atman/Self''/person [...] A truly wise person [...] is known as ''Prajna'' - who has attained ''Brahman''hood itself; thus, testifying to the ''Vedic'' ''Maha Vakya'' (great saying or words of wisdom): ''Prajnanam iti Brahman''.{{sfn|Sahu|2004|p=41}}}}

And according to David Loy, 
{{quote|The knowledge of Brahman [...] is not intuition ''of'' Brahman but itself ''is'' Brahman.{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=62}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">'''Marit ayin''' ({{lang-he-n|◊û÷∑◊®÷∞◊ê÷¥◊ô◊™ ◊¢÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ü}} 'appearance to the eye'; [[Ashkenazic Hebrew|Ashkenazic transliteration]]: '''maris ayin'''), is a concept in [[halakha]] (Jewish law) which states that certain actions which might {{em|seem}} to observers to be in violation of [[Jewish law]], but in reality are fully permissible, are themselves not allowed due to rabbinic enactments that were put in place to prevent onlookers from arriving at a false conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Minchas Shlomo 2-3:53.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the [[Torah]] law, the blood of an animal is forbidden to eat, but the blood of a fish is permissible. However, according to the principle of marit ayin, it is forbidden to eat the blood of fish as an onlooker may believe the blood being eaten is from an animal and is thus allowed to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Keritut Pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

== In private ==
There is a disagreement in the [[Talmud]] as to whether the concept of marit ayin applies in private. [[Beit Shamai]] believes that marit ayin applies even in private, whereas Beit Hillel believes that marit ayin does not apply in private.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Beitzah Pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doesn‚Äôt always apply ==
According to Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] in his book ''Igrot Moshe'', marit ayin applies only when "Someone thinks that I violated something, or he thinks that I inappropriately ate something non-kosher. However, it does not include doing something permitted that people may mistakenly think is forbidden due to the fact that they do not know the [[halakhah|Jewish law]]."&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe O.C. 1:96.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a permitted act which an onlooker might come to believe is a forbidden act being performed, is a case of marit ayin and thus not allowed. However, an act which is allowed which an onlooker might believe is forbidden is not case of marit ayin.

== Judge your fellow favorably ==
There is a principle in Judaism called "dan l'kaf zechus" or judge your fellow favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Shavuot Pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of marit ayin seems to be in contradiction with this principle as if one is performing an action that may look forbidden, it shouldn‚Äôt be worried that an onlooker will think a forbidden action is being performed as we should judge him favorably that he will judge his fellow individual favorably that he is indeed not performing a wrongful act. However, the truth is that the rabbinic prohibition was not put into place because one may think his fellow man is committing a sin, but rather because he may mistakenly think that the action that he wrongly sees taking place is indeed permissible and thus commits the wrongful action himself in error.

== Changes over time ==
According to the [[Shulchan Aruch]], if something which was prohibited in the times of the Talmud because of marit ayin is no longer a concern due to modern day circumstances, the prohibition is cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe O.C. Pg. 243:2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the times of the Talmud having soy milk, or non-dairy creamer, during the same meal as meat would have been prohibited because it was likely to think that the person was in violation of the laws of kosher. However, since it is well known today that people use non-dairy creamer, there is no issue of marit ayin, and the prohibition is cancelled.

He is the host of ''[[The Savage Nation]]'', a [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] talk show that aired on [[Talk Radio Network]] across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20&amp;nbsp;million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.&lt;ref name="Hinckley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hinckley |first=David |title=Barack Obama critics, like Rush Limbaugh, top annual list of influential radio hosts |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_righties_lead_talk_allstar_team.html |access-date=June 26, 2011 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marinucci"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marinucci |first=Carla |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=39618 |title=Politics Blog : SF radio host Michael Savage, banned from Britain: "Will they ban my listeners too?" |publisher=SFGate |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by [[Cumulus Media Networks]]. He holds [[master's degree]]s from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] in medical [[botany]] and [[medical anthropology]], and a Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]]. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on [[nutrition]], [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], and [[homeopathy]]; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.

Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: [[border]]s, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative [[American nationalism|nationalism]], while critics have characterized them as "fostering [[extremism]]."&lt;ref name="least wanted"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8033060.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK 'least wanted' list published | date=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports the [[English-only movement]] and argues that [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] are degrading [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.

Since 2009, Savage has been [[List of people banned from entering the United Kingdom|barred from entering the United Kingdom]] for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."{{refn|&lt;ref name="least wanted" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage forbidden from Britain: "Britain...published its first list of people barred from entering the country" [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/05/michael-savage-banned-fro_n_196631.html The Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/05/michael_savage_banned_in_the_u.html Document quotes:] "Home Office name promoters of hate excluded from the United Kingdom," Savage "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering [[hatred]] which might lead to inter-community violence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC: "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8035114.stm%20 US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain]" May 6, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;}} &lt;!--  see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)]] "Provide an accessible overview"  " It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points‚Äîincluding any prominent controversies.

==Early life and education==
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt; in [[the Bronx]], New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,&lt;ref name="mother" /&gt; [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jewish]] emigrants from Russia.&lt;ref name="mother" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sfsavage"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ron |last=Russell |title=Inside the Savage Nation |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2006-07-19/news/inside-the-savage-nation/full |work=[[SF Weekly]] |date=July 19, 2006 |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="man behind"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=de la Vi√±a |title=The Man Behind the "Savage Nation": Neo-Conservative Host Once Embraced the Counterculture |url=http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/television/6336570.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801234541/http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/television/6336570.htm |archivedate=August 1, 2003 |work=[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]] |date=July 20, 2003 |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his childhood as difficult.&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;  His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.  Jerome died in 1969.  His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Savage|work=[[NNDB]]|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/588/000044456/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother died in 2003.&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths Savage, Rae|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/classified/paid-notice-deaths-savage-rae.html|access-date=July 12, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Jamaica High School (New York City)|Jamaica High School]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noteworthy alumni|url=http://www.jamaicahighschool.org/ALUM/notealum.htm|publisher=Jamaica High School (New York City)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904080202/http://www.jamaicahighschool.org/ALUM/notealum.htm|archivedate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Otterman|first=Sharon|title=Jamaica High May Close, but Memories Will Live On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/nyregion/24jamaica.html|access-date=July 21, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]], where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[biology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous [[psychedelic drug]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]] as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in [[Millbrook, New York]], to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt; Savage then studied at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], earning a [[Master of Science]] in [[botany]] in 1970 and a [[Master of Arts]] in [[anthropology]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|title=Medicinal plants of Tonga|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/36042/Weiner_1970_r.pdf|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=1970|format=Thesis (M.A.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Degrees Awarded in Anthropology: MAs - 1970 to 1979|url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|access-date=June 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825092120/http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|archivedate=August 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1978 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="UCBL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite5.berkeley.edu:8000/WebZ/FETCH?sessionid=01-49886-1724585769&amp;recno=14&amp;resultset=2&amp;format=F&amp;next=html/record.html&amp;bad=error/badfetch.html&amp;:entitytoprecno=14:entitycurrecno=14 |title="UC Berkeley Pathfinder" |access-date=October 5, 2006 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name=mrangry&gt;{{cite news | title = Michael Savage: Mr Angry | author=Guy Adams | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html | work=The Independent | publisher=Independent News &amp; Media PLC | location = London | date = May 9, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195310/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html|archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] was titled ''Nutritional Ethnomedicine in [[Fiji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|year=1978|title=Nutritional ethnomedicine in Fiji|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3287378|work=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume=41|issue=12|page=4468|format=Thesis (Ph.D.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shift in political opinions==
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |title=Michael Savage's long, strange trip |access-date=November 10, 2011 |last=Gilson |first=David |date=March 5, 2003 |publisher=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121163922/http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |archivedate=November 21, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended and traveled with [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapper |first=Jake |authorlink=Jake Tapper |date=September 2003 |title=The Savage Mind |work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Another acquaintance was poet and author [[Neeli Cherkovski]], who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]] in the mold of [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;

Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on [[welfare]] were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a [[social work]]er.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Savage |first = Michael |title = The Savage Nation |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] |year= 2002 |page = 181 |isbn = 0-7852-6353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.&lt;ref name="Playboy" /&gt; Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Savage |first = Michael A. |title = Maximum Immunity |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |year= 1986 |page = 207 |isbn = 0-395-37910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, ''Immigrants and Epidemics'', was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Hirsen |first = James L. |title = Savage Exposes 'The Enemy Within' |publisher=FirstLiberties.com |date = January 28, 2004|url = http://www.firstliberties.com/savage_exposes_enemy.html |access-date = September 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the [[UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar [[Orville Schell]]. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Savage later dropped the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Savage Talk" /&gt;

==Career as commentator==
{{Main|The Savage Nation}}

===Radio===
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about [[illegal immigration]] and [[epidemic]]s prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barbs"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people = Michael Savage |title = The Best of the Savage Nation ‚Äì Volume 2: Barbs on the Berries |medium = CD |publisher=Savage Productions |date= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] (a San Francisco news/[[talk radio]] station) as a fill-in host for the liberal [[Ray Taliaferro]] and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of [[Rush Limbaugh|Rush]] and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in [[Nielsen Audio|Arbitron]] ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.

In mid 2006, Savage had 8‚Äì10&amp;nbsp;million listeners per week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Top Talk Radio Audiences |publisher=Talkers Magazine  |date= September 2007 |url = http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114200439/http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archivedate = November 14, 2006|access-date = June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "...&amp;nbsp;hard edge combined with humor and education&amp;nbsp;... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of [[Plato]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Frankenstein]]."&lt;ref name="MSB" /&gt; Mark de la Vi√±a of the ''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Laura Schlessinger]], Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt;

By 2009, ''The Savage Nation'' had an audience of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.&lt;ref name="Hinckley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marinucci" /&gt; Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the ''New Yorker'' profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/03/090803fa_fact_sanneh?currentPage=all |title=Party of One: Michael Savage, Unexpurgated |work=The New Yorker |date=August 3, 2009|pages=50‚Äì57|volume=85|issue=23|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On September 10, 2009, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] (910&amp;nbsp;kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with [[John and Ken]] from sister station [[KFI]]-AM (640&amp;nbsp;kHz)/Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|title=Rothmann named as Ward's replacement|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/Rothmann-named-as-Ward-s-replacement-3285100.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 4, 2009|pages=Q40}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "...&amp;nbsp;in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Savage off the air in S.F.|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/article/Michael-Savage-off-the-air-in-S-F-3217723.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 11, 2009|pages=D4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914115152/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F09%2F11%2FBAEC19LCOS.DTL|archivedate=September 14, 2009|deadurl=no|access-date=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arbitron monthly ratings, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station [[KTRB]] picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/athletics/article/A-s-radio-flagship-goes-bust-3175177.php | work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Susan | last=Slusser | title=A's radio flagship goes bust | date=September 12, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105095606/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F11%2FSPLP1FCB39.DTL | archivedate=November 5, 2010 | deadurl=no | page=B5 | access-date=May 2, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for ''[[Playboy]]'' had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the ''Playboy'' writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the ''[[The Savage Nation|Savage Nation]]'' but a critic of the profile done by ''The New Yorker''. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" ''Playboy''{{'}}s readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. ''Playboy'' published the interview in June 2010.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochman |first=David |title=Michael Savage: Playboy interview |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |work=Playboy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511092038/http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |date=June 2010 |deadurl=no }} .&lt;/ref&gt; He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word ''Playboy'' interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of [[journalistic objectivity]], but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the ''New Yorker'' interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.

On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with [[Talk Radio Network]], his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Anthony|title=Michael Savage leaves radio show after legal win|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928071952/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|archivedate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via [[Ustream]] on September 30, 2012.

Savage was hired by [[MSNBC]] president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book ''[[The Savage Nation (book)|The Savage Nation]]'' and the objections of [[NBC]] employees including news anchor [[Tom Brokaw]], who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt; Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."&lt;ref name="FAIR" /&gt;

Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as [[prank call]]er Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "[[sodomy|sodomite]]", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

{{quote|Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get [[trichinosis]]. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on&amp;nbsp;... no more calls?&amp;nbsp;... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= MSNBC fires Michael Savage after anti-gay comments | date= July 7, 2003 | work=USA Today | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-07-talk-host-fired_x.htm | access-date = June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/08/1510241 |title=MSNBC Fires Shock Host Michael Savage After He Tells Caller, "Get AIDS and Die, You Pig" |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=July 8, 2003 |access-date=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165242/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F07%2F08%2F1510241 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fost |first=Dan |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/09/MN158024.DTL&amp;ao=all |title=Savage Says He's Sorry But Stays Fired |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 9, 2003 |access-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."&lt;ref name="MSB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Savage : The Compassionate Conservative |publisher=WOR |url=http://www.wor710.com/pages/10608313.php |access-date=November 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025112722/http://www.wor710.com/pages/10608313.php |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited [[Barry Goldwater]] as an influence.&lt;ref name="Savaged NR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klinghoffer|first=David|title=Savaged|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219016/savaged/david-klinghoffer|work=National Review|access-date=July 10, 2011|date=October 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage criticizes [[big government]] as well as [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and liberal activism, and accuses the [[Mainstream media|mainstream news media]] of [[Media bias|liberal bias]].  He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.&lt;ref name="Bush backers haven"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Bush backers find a haven in city known for liberals|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/11/03/MNGVB9KUI81.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 3, 2004|pages=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a strong advocate of [[wildlife preservation]], and has privately urged President Trump to support conservation in meetings at [[Mar-a-Lago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://michaelsavage.com/2017/12/29/michael-talks-about-his-personal-meetings-with-president-trump-over-this-week-at-mar-a-lago-2/|title=Michael talks about his personal meetings with President Trump over this week at Mar-a-Lago|date=2017-12-30|work=The Savage Nation|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed a series of pleas on his radio show for the President to support legislation that protected wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/please-mr-president-spare-the-elephants_us_5a2186f3e4b04dacbc9bd680|title=Please Mr. President, Spare the Elephants|last=Simms|first=Mary Lou|date=2017-12-02|website=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] |language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
Savage describes the [[European Union]] as "Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control." He equates Britain's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|vote to leave the Union]] with the Second World War, saying it was "in many ways the [[Battle of Britain]] all over again." Savage foresees that, after [[Brexit]], the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of "a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTcet3vbaiA|title=The Savage Nation ‚Äì Episode 19|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=|website=YouTube|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican presidential candidates ===
In 2003, Savage said that he voted in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] for [[George W. Bush]] "quite reluctantly, incidentally."&lt;ref name="TalkBack Live"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Are SUV Owners Supporting Terrorism?; California Redefines Rape|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/08/tl.00.html|series=TalkBack Live|serieslink=Talkback Live|network=CNN|airdate=January 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.&lt;ref name="Bush backers haven" /&gt; Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate [[Jerry Brown]] in the [[California Attorney General election, 2006|2006 California Attorney General election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Matier, Phil |author2=Ross, Andrew |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Has the mayor's new girlfriend, who is only 20, been drinking? |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/15/MNR.TMP |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 15, 2006 |pages=B1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309114412/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F10%2F15%2FMNR.TMP |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Savage subscribes to the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/01/michael-savage-promotes-white-nationalist-conspiracy-his-radio-show-wins-praise-racist |title=Michael Savage promotes white nationalist conspiracy on his radio show, wins praise from racist author |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] belief, which claims that [[white people]] are becoming extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide.

==Activism==
===Legal defense contributions===
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] accused of [[Haditha massacre|murdering civilians]] in [[Haditha|Haditha, Iraq]]; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homestead.com/prosites-prs/shackled.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164021/http://www.homestead.com/prosites-prs/shackled.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |title=Shackled Marine Update |access-date=September 21, 2007 |author=Jeremiah J.

==Awards and criticism==
===Awards===
On June 9, 2007, ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.&lt;ref name="newsblaze.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Savage Honored with Freedom of Speech Award |url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20070328082543nnnn.np/topstory.html |work=News Blaze |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''National Radio Hall of Fame'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Criticism===
In July 2005, former CBS reporter [[Bernard Goldberg]] ranked Savage as number 61 in his book ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top [[bile]]&amp;nbsp;... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dhingra | first =Philip | title =''Who is in Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America?

On April 17, 2006, Savage was seriously criticized worldwide after he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100&amp;nbsp;million of them, then there'll be 900&amp;nbsp;million of them.' I mean, would you rather die‚Äîwould you rather us die than them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2008/01/04/oped_resp_stillwell.DTL |title= SF Chronicle Free Speech vs Hate Speech |access-date= May 10, 2009 | first=Safaa | last=Ibrahim | date=January 3, 2008 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.&lt;ref name="Ref-4"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech|author=Leith, Sam|date=May 6, 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/07/radio-michael-savage-ban-britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the actor [[Robin Williams]]' [[suicide]], Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Media Matters for America]]|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/21/michael-savages-disgusting-rant-ptsd-and-depres/201248|title=Michael Savage's Disgusting Rant: PTSD And Depression Sufferers Are "Weak," "Narcissistic," "Losers"|date=October 21, 2014|author=Hananoki, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion prompted criticism,&lt;ref name=MM /&gt;

====Catholic Church and immigration====
In March 2006, Savage criticised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]] of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910220924/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title=Savage Remarks Anger Catholics |publisher=[[Newsmax Media]] |date=April 3, 2006 |access-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |title=Michael Savage's Catholicism |access-date=July 9, 2011 |date=March 30, 2006 |author=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120234511/http://catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |archivedate=November 20, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flags]] to counter pro-immigration rallies in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Myung Oak|title=Foreign flags create flap Mexican banners at recent rallies prompt backlash|publisher=''Rocky Mountain News''|date=March 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award====
When ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," [[C-SPAN]] opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.&lt;ref name="newsblaze.com" /&gt; Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2007/06/c-span-shares-lamb-skewers-on-air-004576?paginate=false|title=C-SPAN shares Lamb skewers on air|author=Mortman, Howard|work=Politico|date=June 21, 2007|access-date=August 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625212709/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=4AFF492C-3048-5C12-0025D780C6B9F45C|archivedate=June 25, 2007|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dispute with CAIR====
In early November 2007, the [[Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations]] (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need [[deportation]]", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html|title=Boycotted Radio Host Remains Unbowed|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg|date=December 17, 2007|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221095258/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html?ei=5088&amp;en=0052db888e9244dc&amp;ex=1355547600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=December 21, 2007|access-date=February 11, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting [[Hamas]].

On November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, [[Citrix Systems|Citrix Systems, Inc.]] pulled its advertisements from his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClellan|first=Steve|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/citrix-pulls-spots-savage-nation-91037/ |title=Citrix Pulls Spots From ‚ÄòSavage Nation‚Äô|work=Adweek|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage sued CAIR for [[copyright]] infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.&lt;ref&gt;Judi McLeod, [http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/927 "One for Savage, zero for CAIR"],  canadafreepress.com, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Curtis| first =Kim | title =Radio host Michael Savage sues Islamic organization over ads | publisher=[[The Press-Enterprise]]| date =December 3, 2007| url =http://www.pe.com/ap_news/California/CA_Radio_Host_Lawsuit_317999C.shtml| access-date =December 4, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2008, [[United States district court]] Judge [[Susan Illston]] dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egelko|first=Bob|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Suit-against-Savage-Nation-radio-host-tossed-3275816.php|title=Suit against 'Savage Nation' radio host tossed|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731003952/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F07%2F25%2FBA2111VQOI.DTL|archivedate=July 31, 2008|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center.

In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of [[autism]] diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/radio-host-michael-savage-incites-protests-autism-comments-article-1.350990|title=Radio host Michael Savage incites protests with autism comments|last=Sandoval|first=Edgar|last2=Kennedy|first2=Helen|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=July 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724233046/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/07/21/2008-07-21_radio_host_michael_savage_incites_protes.html|archivedate=July 24, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

In July 2008 the progressive pressure group [[Media Matters for America]] picketed the studios of [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in New York, along with parents of autistic children.&lt;ref name="Aronow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Lily|title=If Savage was smearing only misdiagnoses of autism, why did he previously call autism itself a "phony disease"?|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2008/07/23/if-savage-was-smearing-only-misdiagnoses-of-aut/144127|website=Media Matters|publisher=David Brock|access-date=August 6, 2016|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; WOR issued a statement saying, "We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners."&lt;ref name=NYDN /&gt; Also that day, the insurance company [[Aflac]] pulled its advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Savage Loses Advertisers|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2008|access-date=July 23, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/arts/23arts-SAVAGELOSESA_BRF.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Supertalk Mississippi]] radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with ''[[Dennis Miller#The Dennis Miller Show 2|The Dennis Miller Show]]''.&lt;ref name="STM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Station nixes 'Savage Nation'|last=Pettus|first=Gary|newspaper=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|date=July 22, 2008|access-date=July 22, 2008|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080722/NEWS/807220363/1001/news}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left [[Stalinism|Stalinists]]" who want him off of the air. He appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' with [[Glenn Beck]] as the substitute host for [[Larry King]], and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the [[overdiagnosis]] of children due to [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]]' drive to drug children for higher profits.&lt;ref name=NYDN /&gt; On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], [[The Home Depot]], and [[DirectBuy]], will discontinue their support for Savage's show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autism group: Advertisers dropping Savage |last=Rosen |first=Daniel |newspaper=Newsday |date=July 25, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726,0,3274609.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728100819/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726%2C0%2C3274609.story |archivedate=July 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage's syndicator, [[Talk Radio Network]], has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728072736/http://www.savageonautism.com/|archivedate=July 28, 2008|title=20 audio clips of Michael Savage's comments on Autism|publisher=Talk Radio Network|url=http://www.savageonautism.com|access-date=September 20, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banned from entering the United Kingdom====
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] that Savage was on a [[list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom]] as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering [[hatred]] which might lead to inter-community violence".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK 'least wanted' list published |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033060.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Who is on UK least wanted list' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033319.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5282245/US-talkshow-host-to-sue-Jacqui-Smith-over-ban-from-Britain.html US talkshow host Michael Savage to sue Jacqui Smith over ban from Britain] Alex Spillius, telegraph.co.uk, May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |title=Home Office name hate promoters excluded from the UK |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 6, 2009 |publisher=UK Home Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507181855/http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for [[defamation]], calling her a "lunatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8035114.stm |title=US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain |publisher=BBC News |work=|access-date=May 5, 2009 | date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a subsequent [[NPR]] talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After host [[Neal Conan]] pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic&amp;nbsp;... to link me up with [[White power skinhead|Nazi skinheads]] who are killing people in [[Russia]]&amp;nbsp;... to put me in league with [[Hamas]] murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Savage Banned in The UK |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=103819122 |work=[[NPR]] |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Kelland

You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Of the banning, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], wrote:
"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed&amp;nbsp;... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle&amp;nbsp;... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/5304788/Michael-Savage-poses-no-risk-to-British-security-so-why-wont-MPs-say-so.html Michael Savage poses no risk to British security so why won't MPs say so?] Boris Johnson, The Daily Telegraph, May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Catherine Bennett (journalist)|Catherine Bennett]] wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/10/michael-savage-radio-homeopathy-jacqui-smith Yes Jacqui, let's keep out those dangerous homeopaths] Catherine Bennett, ''The Guardian'', May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."&lt;ref name="Ref-4" /&gt;

====Veteran PTSD====
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything&amp;nbsp;... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world.

During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Jewish Synagogue [[Chabad house]] in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; In a 2003 interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=Radio Talk Show Host Michael Savage|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2003/09/16/radio-talk-show-host-michael-savage/print|work=The O'Reilly Factor|publisher=Fox News|access-date=July 17, 2011|date=September 16, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725060653/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2003/09/16/radio-talk-show-host-michael-savage/print|archivedate=July 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2012 book ''Trickle Down Tyranny'', Savage wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;I'm not religious.

Savage is noted as a supporter of wildlife conservation efforts, speaking out against the poaching of elephants in Africa. He has pleaded on his show and called upon President Donald J.

==Books==
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 ''New York Times'' Best Sellers and three additional books which made ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106021054/http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006150437/http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012104/http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 21, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.

His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]]. In them, he advocates [[nutrition]]al, [[Herbalism|herbal]], and [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as [[Malnutrition|poor diet]], [[Ageing|aging]], [[arthritis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cancer]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine addiction]], the [[common cold]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Weiner/e/B001HCYZ9W|title=Michael A. Weiner|website=www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written about [[tree planting]], [[Beer sommelier#Beer tasting|beer-tasting]], and [[Nutrition|nutritional cooking]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com" /&gt;

His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.

In 1991, Savage self-published ''The Death of the White Male'', an argument against [[affirmative action]], through Quantum Books.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web|title =Entry for: ''The death of the white male'' |work=[[WorldCat]].org |url =http://worldcat.org/oclc/54958700?tab=holdings |access-date =January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "[[reverse discrimination]]", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsor the Paul Revere Society |work=Paul Revere Society website |url=http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |access-date=January 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211084614/http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, Savage published ''The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture'', his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of ''The New York Times Best Seller list]'', earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal [[media bias]]", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay activists]], and liberals.

In January 2004, Savage published his second political book ''[[The Enemy Within (Savage book)|The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military]]''. His next book, ''[[Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder]]'', was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike ''The Savage Nation'', both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In April 2006, Savage released ''[[The Political Zoo]]''. The book contains [[Satire|satirical]] profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in [[caricature]] as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.

In October 2010, Savage released ''Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security''. Released through the [[HarperCollins]] imprint of [[William Morrow and Company]], Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this [[Marxism|Marxist]]/[[Leninism|Leninist]]-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."&lt;ref&gt;Boog, Jason.

June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, ''[[Abuse of Power]]'', was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in [[San Francisco]], mainly in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], as well as [[London]], and [[Tel Aviv]]. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie.

In 2014, Savage released ''Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth'', in which Savage writes in part, "We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/|last=Vernon|first=Wes|work=The Washington Times|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119203910/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/?page=all|archivedate=November 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Savage released another New York Times Best Seller titled ''Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture.'' It tells of how the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, "borders, language and culture," and the destruction the Obama Presidency brought to the country.

In 2016 Savage released "Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23874">The '''New Qing History''' is a [[school of thought]] that gained prominence in the United States in the mid-1990s by offering a wide-ranging [[Historical revisionism|revision of history]] of the Manchu [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grace Yen Shen, ''Unearthing the Nation: Modern Geology and Nationalism in Republican China'', (University of California Press, 2014), 200 note4.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier historians had emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to ‚Äú[[sinicization|sinicize]]‚Äù their conquerors, that is, to assimilate and make them Chinese in their thought and institutions. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began to learn Manchu and took advantage of newly opened [[Chinese language|Chinese]]- and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]-language archives. This research found that the Manchu rulers were savvy in manipulating their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as they did [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. According to some scholars, at the height of their power, the Qing regarded "China" as only a part, although a very important part, of [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|a much wider empire that extended into]] the [[Inner Asia]]n territories of [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] (today sometimes called [[Manchuria]]) and [[Xinjiang]], or Chinese (Eastern) Turkestan.{{sfnb|Waley-Cohen|2004| p = 194-197}}

Some scholars criticize the approach for exaggerating the Manchu character of the dynasty, and some in China accuse the American historians in the group of imposing American concerns with race and identity or even of imperialist misunderstanding to weaken China. Still others in China agree that this scholarship has opened new vistas for the study of Qing history.{{sfnb|Ding|2009| p = [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/CSH0009-4633430208#.VO0CxfnF-7s ]}}

The use of "New Qing History" as an approach is to be distinguished from the ''New Qing History'', a multi-volume history of the Qing dynasty that was authorized by the [[Chinese State Council]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Mao |first1 = Liping |last2 = Zhao |first2 =Ma  |title ="Writing History in the Digital Age": The New Qing History Project and the Digitization of Qing Archives |journal =History Compass |volume =10 |issue = 5 |pages =367‚Äì374 |date =2012 |language = |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1111/j.1478-0542.2012.00841.x |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Prominent scholars who have been associated with the New Qing History, including [[Evelyn Rawski]], [[Mark Elliott (historian)|Mark Elliott]], [[Pamela Kyle Crossley]], [[Laura Hostetler]], Philippe For√™t, and others, despite differing among themselves on important points, represent an "[[Inner Asia]]n" and "[[Eurasia]]n" turn, which conceived the Manchu-centered Qing as fundamentally different from most earlier dynasties but as similar to the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]], [[Mogul empire|Mogul]], and [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Empires across the Eurasian landmass. They argued that the Qing saw itself as a universal empire, a multi-national polity, which with China as only the most central and economically important component. They date the founding of the empire from 1636, when the dynasty was proclaimed, rather than from 1644, when the Qing took control of Beijing. The historians argued that "Manchu" identity was deliberately created only after the takeover of China and that the new racial identity was important but "fungible," easily exchanged for others. The first rulers of the dynasty played the Confucian role of [[Son of Heaven]] but at the same time, often behind the backs of their Han Chinese ministers, adopted other roles to rule other ethnic groups.

The military expansion of frontiers, which Han Chinese ministers often opposed, as it drained resources from China proper, showed that the Qing empire was not only a victim of imperialism but also practiced imperialism itself. Some of the historians followed Evelyn Rawski calling the Qing "Early Modern," rather than "late imperial," on the grounds that the Manchus created a centralized empire that the Ming could not have created.{{sfnb|Rowe|2009| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=KN7Awmzx2PAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20qing%20history%22&amp;f=false 4-10]}}

==Origins==
The origins of the New Qing History lie in Inner Asian Studies. A Harvard scholar, Joseph Fletcher, studied the languages and culture of Central Asia. He was among those to discredit the idea that nearly all Manchu documents were translations from Chinese and that they would add little to the record. He wrote in 1981, "Qing scholars who want to do first-class work in the archives must, from now on, learn Manchu and routinely compare the Manchu and Chinese sources for their topics of research." Beatrice Bartlett, a Yale historian who had studied Manchu with Fletcher, reported in an article, 'Books of Revelations', that the archives in Taiwan and Beijing revealed many secrets, which required knowledge of Manchu.

The [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] of the Yongzheng emperor operated only in Manchu until the 1730s, and many other important edicts and memorials did not have Chinese translations. Official use of the language, she argued, did not decline during the 19th century. She concluded that the archives of Manchu materials were more likely to be complete, as they were less likely to have been raided, weeded or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Both quoted in {{cite book | first = Gertrude | last = Roth Li | title = Manchu: A Textbook for Reading Documents | year = 2010 | publisher = National Foreign Language Resource Center | p =11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bArr1-E5mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Fletcher%20manchu%20language&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 29, 2017| isbn = 9780980045956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History took on distinct form in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Crossley and Rawski summarized the arguments for using Manchu-language materials, materials, which they and others had explored in the newly opened archives in Beijing and were beginning to use in their publications.{{sfnb|CrossleyRawski|1993}} Evelyn Rawski's presidential address, "Re-envisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History," at the annual meeting of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1996, particularly criticized the question of the "sinicization" of the Qing that had been raised by [[Ping-ti Ho]] in his 1967 article "The Significance of the Ch'ing Period in Chinese History." Rawski's thought was based on a Manchu-centric concept of history and indicated that the reason the Qing rulers could successfully govern China for nearly 300 years was not the result of sinicization, adopting the characteristics of Han Chinese rule and culture, but by their focus on retaining the characteristics of Manchu culture. They used such characteristics to strengthen relations with other nationalities to build a multiracial empire that included [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] and other nationalities.{{sfnb|Rawski|1996|}} For better governing his multiethnic empire, for instance, the Kangxi emperor located his summer residence in the [[Chengde Mountain Resort]], north of the Great Wall. That became the historical core of city of [[Chengde]], which the Qianlong emperor enlarged considerably, including a replica of the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;For√™t (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Ping-ti Ho published "In Defense of Sinicization: A Rebuttal of Evelyn Rawski's 'Re-envisioning the Qing'". He argued that the pattern of Chinese history was for a [[conquest dynasty]] to adopt Chinese ways of rule and culture and attacked Rawski for Manchu-centrism.{{sfnb|Ho|1998|}}

The school that is now known as the "New Qing History" developed after the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, [http://www.csstoday.com/Item/1243.aspx Beyond the culture: my comments on New Qing history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, historian Huang Pei published a monograph that developed the objections stated by Ho Ping-ti. {{sfnb|Huang|2011|}}

There are differences among the scholars in the loose group. For example, Rawski's ''Re-envisioning the Qing'' and Elliott‚Äôs ''The Manchu Way'' regard the Qing as a Manchu empire, with China being only one part. Nevertheless, Pamela Kyle Crossley sees the empire not as a Manchu empire but as a "simultaneous" system in which the rulership is not subordinate to the Chinese or any other single culture. She criticized the "Manchu-centered" school for romanticism and a reliance upon disproved theories about "[[Altaic]]" language and history, but she seems to include herself in the Qing empire school, which she calls "Qing Studies."&lt;ref&gt;"A Reserved View of the New Qing History"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, historian Richard J. Smith reported that an interpretive "middle ground" had emerged between the views of Rawski and Crossley, on one hand, and Ho and Huang, on the other. Smith himself had come to the conclusion that "the Qing empire" and "China" were not the same thing and that the Qing had to be placed in not only a Manchu context but one that included Inner Asia in general and that saw China in a global field. The less "sinocentric" view, Smith continued, which placed less emphasis on "sinicization," had won over most Western scholars on China, in spite of debates over "matters of degree."{{sfnb|Smith|2015| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=RhmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=smith+qing+dynasty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDlMmSqJjQAhXGJCYKHTFfAlQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20qing%20history&amp;f=false ix-xi]}}

==Responses==
The arguments put forward in the New Qing History inspired debate on a number of specific points.

The scholar Zhao Gang responded against the revisionist historians by noting that they claimed that the Qing used only "China" (‰∏≠Âúã) to encompass only Han people (Êº¢‰∫∫) and "[[China proper]]" and pointed out that in fact that China proper and Han people were not synonymous with "China" in the Qing view according to Mark Elliott's own work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han dynasty used Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) to refer only to Han areas, but the Qing dynasty reinvented the definition of Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) to refer to non-Han areas as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Gang cited Qing documents with Qing being used for the Manchu term Dulimbai Gurun (a direct translation of "‰∏≠Âúã", Zhongguo; "Middle Kingdom") in Manchu texts and Zhongguo in Chinese texts to refer to the entire Qing including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet as "China", [[Names of the Qing dynasty|in official documents, edicts, treaties]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in texts like the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]],{{sfnp|Zhao|2006|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 8 and 12]}} [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)#Convention of Kyakhta (1768)|Convention of Kyakhta]] (1768),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|1755 pronouncement by the Qianlong Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Manchu language memorial on the conquest of Dzungaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEHtUunnIIvksASBzIEQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun%20land&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;dq=steppes+mountains+rivers+Dzungar+unified+with+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5UHtUuvvCcu_sQStu4HYBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=steppes%20mountains%20rivers%20Dzungar%20unified%20with%20china&amp;f=false Elliott 2001], p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|Qianlong's arguments for the annexation of Xinjiang]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Qianlong's sinicization policies in parts of Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 18, 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Elliott wrote that it was under the Qing that "China" transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the "state claimed sovereignty," rather than only the [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] area and its people by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2658945?seq=36 Elliot 2000], p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Barabantseva has also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as "Chinese" (‰∏≠Âúã‰πã‰∫∫), and they used the term Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire but used "Hanren" (Êº¢‰∫∫) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3XFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Barabantseva 2010], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph W. Esherick]] observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the [[Lifan Yuan]] and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (‰∏≠Âúã) and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Esherick 2006], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other points===
Scholars have disagreed on whether or how much the Manchu rulers used new forms of imperial ritual to display new forms of empire or continued rituals from the Ming to show that they saw themselves as heirs of a Han Chinese empire. Roger Des Forges' review of [[David M. Robinson]]'s ''Martial Spectacles of the Ming Court'' criticized scholars of conquest dynasties and New Qing History and disagreed with the idea that  the "Royal hunt" was a differing factor between Han Chinese and [[conquest dynasties]]. He noted that the martial themed Ming dynasty [[Grand Review (China)|Grand Review]] was copied by the Qing and disagreed with those who sought to present it as a Qing feature. He praised Robinson in differing from scholars who selected [[History of the Ming dynasty#Universal rulership|certain Ming and Qing emperors]] to contrast their difference and for not conflating Han with "Chinese" and not translating the term "Zhongguo".&lt;ref&gt;Roger des Forges, [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v60p299.pdf (Review)] ''Journal of Chinese Studies'' No. 60 ‚Äì (January 2015) pp. 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History, according to Tristan G. Brown, writing in 2011, did not explore the example of Islam and Muslims to test their argument that the early Qing emperors aspired to be universal monarchs. Brown finds that an inscription by the Qianlong emperor showed that he wanted to incorporate both Xinjiang and Islam into his empire and that this inscription, along with the "inventive structural duality of Chinese-Islamic architecture with Central Asian Turkish-Islamic architectural forms," makes the "most compelling case" that New Qing History is also applicable to Chinese Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first =Tristan G. |last = Brown | journal = Journal of Chinese Studies| volume =53 |date = July 2011 |title = Towards an Understanding of Qianlong's Conception of Islam: A Study of the Dedication Inscriptions of the Fragrant Concubine's Mosque in the Imperial Capital|url = http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v53p137.pdf |pp = 138, 145| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In the journal ''Chinese Social Sciences Today'', an official publication of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Li Zhiting, a scholar working on the National Qing Dynasty Compilation Committee, charged that "'New Qing History' is academically absurd, and politically does damage to the unity of China...." He sought to "expose its mask of pseudo-academic scholarship, eliminating the deleterious effect it has had on scholarship in China." Li went on to charge that the "whole range of views [New Qing History scholars] express are cliches and stereotypes, little more than dusted off versions in a scholarly tone of the Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism of the 19th century." American scholars such as Evelyn Rawski, Pamela Crossley, Mark Elliott, and James Millward, Li continued, "view the history of China from an imperialist standpoint, with imperialist points of view and imperialist eyes, regarding 'traditional' China as an 'empire,' regarding the Qing dynasty as 'Qing dynasty imperialism.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Li |first = Zhiting ÊùéÊ≤ª‰∫≠| title = Scholars Criticize 'New Qing History': An Example of 'New Imperialist' History| journal = Chinese Social Sciences Today| date = April 20, 2015| ref = harv}} translated in {{Cite journal | url = http://cmp.hku.hk/2015/04/22/38664/ | last = | first = |title = A righteous view of history|journal  = China Media Project |date=April 2015| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In signal processing, the '''polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution''' is a [[quasiprobability distribution]] that generalizes the [[Wigner distribution function]]. It was proposed by Boualem Boashash and Peter O'Shea in 1994.

== Introduction ==

Many signals in nature and in engineering applications can be modeled as &lt;math&gt;z(t)=e^{j2\pi\phi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial phase and &lt;math&gt;j=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, it is important to detect signals of an arbitrary high-order polynomial phase. However, the conventional Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution have the limitation being based on the second-order statistics. Hence, the polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution was proposed as a generalized form of the conventional Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution, which is able to deal with signals with nonlinear phase.

== Definition ==

The polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution &lt;math&gt;W^g_z(t, f)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; W^g_z(t, f)=\mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}\left[K^g_z(t, \tau)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Fourier transform]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K^g_z(t, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial kernel given by

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(t, \tau)=\prod_{k=-\frac{q}{2}}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the input signal and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is an even number.
The above expression for the kernel may be rewritten in symmetric form as

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(t, \tau)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(t+c_{-k}\tau\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}} &lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time version of the polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution is given by the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(n, m)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(n+c_{k}m\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(n+c_{-k}m\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n=t{f}_s, m={\tau}{f}_{s},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling frequency.
The conventional [[Wigner distribution function|Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution]] is a special case of the polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution with &lt;math&gt;q=2, b_{-1}=-1, b_1=1, b_0=0, c_{-1}=-\frac{1}{2}, c_0=0, c_1=\frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

One of the simplest generalizations of the usual Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution kernel can be achieved by taking &lt;math&gt;q=4&lt;/math&gt;. The set of coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; must be found to completely specify the new kernel. For example, we set

:&lt;math&gt; b_1=-b_{-1}=2, b_2=b_{-2}=1, b_0=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_1=-c_{-1}=0.675, c_2=-c_{-2}=-0.85&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting discrete-time kernel is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(n, m)=\left[z\left(n+0.675m\right)z^*\left(n-0.675m\right)\right]^2z^*\left(n+0.85m\right)z\left(n-0.85m\right) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Design of a Practical Polynomial Kernel ===
Given a signal &lt;math&gt;z(t)=e^{j2\pi\phi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)=\sum_{i=0}^p a_i t^i&lt;/math&gt;is a polynomial function, its instantaneous frequency (IF) is &lt;math&gt;\phi'(t) = \sum_{i=1}^p ia_it^{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a practical polynomial kernel &lt;math&gt;K^g_z(t, \tau)&lt;/math&gt;, the set of coefficients &lt;math&gt;q, b_k&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt;should be chosen properly such that&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
K^g_z(t, \tau) &amp;=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(t+c_{-k}\tau\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}}\\
&amp;= \exp(j2\pi \sum_{i=1}^pia_it^{i-1}\tau)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
W_z^g(t,f) &amp;= \int_{-\infin}^{\infin} \exp(-j2\pi(f - \sum_{i=1}^p i a_i t^{i-1}) \tau)d\tau\\
&amp;\cong \delta (f - \sum_{i=1}^p i a_i t^{i-1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;q=2, b_{-1}=-1, b_0=0, b_1=1, p=2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;z\left(t+c_1\tau\right)z^*\left(t+c_{-1}\tau\right)=\exp(j2\pi \sum_{i=1}^2 i a_i t^{i-1}\tau)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2(t+c_1)^2 + a_1(t+c_1) - a_2(t + c_{-1})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-1}) = 2a_2t\tau + a_1\tau&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_1 - c_{-1} = 1, c_1 + c_{-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_1=\frac{1}{2}, c_{-1}=-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;q=4, b_{-2}=b_{-1}=-1, b_0=0, b_2=b_1=1, p=3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;a_3(t + c_1)^3 + a_2(t+c_1)^2 + a_1(t+c_1) \\
&amp;a_3(t + c_2)^3 + a_2(t+c_2)^2 + a_1(t+c_2) \\
&amp;- a_3(t + c_{-1})^3 - a_2(t + c_{-1})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-1}) \\
&amp;- a_3(t + c_{-2})^3 - a_2(t + c_{-2})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-2}) \\
&amp;= 3a_3t^2\tau + 2a_2t\tau + a_1\tau
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow 
\begin{cases} 
c_1 + c_2 - c_{-1} - c_{-2} = 1 \\ 
c_1^2 + c_2^2 - c_{-1}^2 - c_{-2}^2 = 0 \\ 
c_1^3 + c_2^3 - c_{-1}^3 - c_{-2}^3 = 0 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Applications ==

Nonlinear FM signals are common both in nature and in engineering applications. For example, the sonar system of some bats use hyperbolic FM and quadratic FM signals for echo location. In radar, certain pulse-compression schemes employ linear FM and quadratic signals. The [[Wigner distribution function|Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution]] has optimal concentration in the time-frequency plane for linear [[Frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] signals. However, for nonlinear frequency modulated signals, optimal concentration is not obtained, and smeared spectral representations result. The polynomial Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution can be designed to cope with such problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30355">‚ÄòNet positive‚Äô, from '''Positive Development''' (PD) theory, is a new paradigm in [[sustainable development]] and design.  PD theory (taught and published from 2003)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2003) ‚ÄòRetrofitting: Beyond Zero Waste‚Äô, in ''KLM-UC International Conference Proceedings'', University of Canberra, ACT, Australia; Birkeland, J. (2004) ‚ÄòBuilding Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts‚Äô, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, Australia, http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland (accessed 2005);  Birkeland, J. (2005) ‚ÄòReversing Negative Impacts by Design‚Äô, in ''Sustainability for the ACT: the Future‚Äôs in our Hands'', Office of Sustainability, ACT, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; was first detailed in ''Positive Development'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development: From Vicious Circles to Virtuous Cycles through Built Environment Design‚Äô'', Earthscan, London.  (A two volume book updating net positive theory is forthcoming.)&lt;/ref&gt; A net positive system/structure would ‚Äògive back to nature and society more than it takes‚Äô over its life cycle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eco-positive impacts of development must keep pace with human consumption (or ecological footprint) and offset past losses of nature, as defined in ''Positive Development'' ''(Ibid)'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ‚Äòsustainable development‚Äô - in the real-world context of population growth, biodiversity losses, cumulative pollution, wealth disparities and social inequities - closes off future options.  To reverse direction, development must, among other sustainability criteria, increase nature beyond pre-human conditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;A sustainable building should aim to be better for nature/society than no building at all, as well as increase nature beyond native conditions.  A rule of reason would be applied as to whether the baseline is pre-industrial or pre-historic, depending on the location and circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; PD develops the tools to enable net positive design and development.

== Net Positive Sustainability ==
According to PD, the original precepts of sustainability (nature preservation and equity among current/future generations)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;These principles are common to most early definitions of sustainability and were endorsed at a national level as early as 1969 in the preamble to the National Environmental Protection Act in the United States. Among the first international documents to define sustainability was the IUCN/UNEP/WWF (1980) ''World Conservation Strategy'', re-published in 1991 as ''Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living'', The World Conservation Union, United Nations Environment Program and World Wide Fund for Nature, Earthscan, London, UK.  Here it meant improving life quality within the earth‚Äôs ecological carrying capacity. See also COAG (1992) The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, Australia.  For historical context, see Commoner, B. (1971) ''The Closing Circle: Nature, Man And Technology'', Knopf, New York and Porritt, J. (1985) ''Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology Explained'', Blackwell Publishers, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; require increasing future options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Social options do not mean more consumer products but rather substantive and positive life choices which requires increasing the ecological base and public estate.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, requires that development increase the life support system (nature).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;The idea that sustainability requires maintaining or increasing future option was discussed in Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society: Institutional Reform and Social Transformation'', University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. See also Norton, B.G. (2005) ''Sustainability: A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois for a comprehensive discussion on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; Green design always aimed for ecological restoration, social regeneration and economic revitalization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;For a typology of green building design, see Birkeland, J. (2013) ‚ÄòBusiness Opportunities through Positive Development‚Äô, in ''A New Dynamic: Effective Business in a Circular Economy'', in K. Webster, J. Bleriot, and C. Johnston (Eds), Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing, Isle of Wight, UK, pp. 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these essentially ‚Äòadd value‚Äô relative to ''current'' sites, buildings or practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;For a discussion of contemporary sustainable building design approaches, see Hes, D. and du Plessus, D. (2015) ''Designing for Hope: Pathways to Regenerative Sustainability'', Taylor &amp; Francis, New York. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not increase nature in absolute terms.  Positive development is defined as structures that increase universal life quality and future options by expanding the ‚Äòecological base‚Äô (ecosystems, ecological carrying capacity, biodiversity) and the ‚Äòpublic estate‚Äô (universal access to means of survival/wellbeing and social capital).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Birkeland, J.

== Terminology Clarification ==
The term net positive&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;The term also appears as ‚Äònet-positive‚Äô or ‚Äònetpositive‚Äô.  A special issue was dedicated to net-positive design.  See Cole, R. (2015) ‚ÄòNet-zero and Net-positive Design: a question of value‚Äô, in ''Building Research &amp; Information'' 43(1), pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly used by green designers, developers and businesses.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;For example, see Forum for the Future, WWF, and The Climate Group (2015) ''Net Positive: A New Way of Doing Business''. Available at http://www.theclimategroup.org/what-we-do/publications/net-positive-a-new-way-of-doing-business/ Accessed June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in context, it usually means just ‚Äògiving back‚Äô - that is, without fixed baselines&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Benchmarks are relative to the present, so eco-restoration is seen by some as net positive, yet this does not account for past biodiversity losses and increased human consumption.&lt;/ref&gt; - by optimizing material resources, energy and stakeholder benefits, etc.  This was the aim of 20th Century green building design.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;There are a wide range of 20th Century green design books, including:  Papanek, V. (1971) ''Design for the Real World: human ecology and social change'', Pantheon Books, New York; Johnson, R. (1979) ''The Green City'', MacMillan: S. Melbourne, Australia;  Todd, N. and J. Todd (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', N. Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.; Vale, B. and R. Vale (1975) ''The Autonomous House: Design and Planning for self-''sufficiency, Thames and Hudson Ltd, London;  Wann, D. (1996) ''Deep Design: Pathways to a Liveable Future'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  Lyle, J.T. (1994) ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'', Wiley &amp; Sons, New York;  van der Ryn, S, and Cowan, D. (1996)  ''Ecological Design'', Island Press, Washington, DC.  Mackenzie, D. (1991), ''Green Design: Design for the Environment'', Lawrence King, London;  Girardet, H. (1992), ''The Gaia Atlas of Cities: New Directions for Sustainable Urban Living'', Gaia books Ltd, London; and Yeang, K. (1999) ''The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable Intensive Buildings'', Prestel Verlag, Munich, Germany [Yeang has written numerous books on green design].&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental ethics and social justice remain central concerns in PD,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Social factors have always been a part of sustainable design paradigms, but the focus is generally on the (psychological, social, physiological, experiential, etc.) needs of building users, and less on using a building project to solve social inequities in the wider community.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, ‚Äòeco-positive‚Äô is increasingly used to underscore the ecological dimension. The term ‚Äònet‚Äô also causes some confusion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;See for example, Baggs, D. (2015) Buildings Alone will Never be Regenerative, in ''Sourceable - Industry News and Analysis'' https://sourceable.net/buildings-alone-will-never-be-regenerative/ June 29.  Accessed July 2015.  This claims net positive design only concerns resource balances and does not use a life cycle perspective, but this has no basis in PD literature.&lt;/ref&gt; In PD, ‚Äònet‚Äô means public benefits ''beyond'' neutral impacts - not just reducing the total negative impacts to zero by, for example, making tradeoffs.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;For an overview of zero energy building, see Kibert, C.J. and Fard, M.M. (2012) Differentiating among Low-energy, Low-carbon and Net Zero-energy Building Strategies for Policy Formulation, ''Building Research &amp; Information'', 40(5), pp. 625-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory Origins ==
PD theory built on eco-philosophies that emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;See for example, Merchant, C. (1980) ''The Death of Nature: Women, ecology, and the scientific revolution'', HarperCollins, New York; Warren, K. (1997), ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana;  Naess, A. (1989) ''Ecology, community, and lifestyle'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, UK; Warren, K. and Wells-Howe, B. (1994) ''Ecological Feminism'', Routledge, New York;  Salleh, A. (1997) ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', Zed Books, London;  Shiva, V. (1988) ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Development'', Zed Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for social transformation, they deconstructed the hierarchical cultures, dualistic thought patterns and linear-reductionist analyses of modernity. PD added a positive/negative overlay to explain why these theories did not contemplate increasing nature to offset consumption. Later, sustainability was absorbed into the dominant paradigm (DP) which assumed that current institutions could resolve the problems they fostered.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;See WCED (1987) ''Our Common Future'', Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  This seminal report couched sustainability within the dominant economic and policy making frameworks and did not engage with the sustainability literature critical of the dominant paradigm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PD, existing institutional and physical structures reduce future options and are thus terminal.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;''Planning for Sustainability, Ibid.'' Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was that, by converting negative systems into positive ones, genuinely sustainable planning, decision and design frameworks would materialize.

=== Design-decision Distinction ===
The distinction between decision-making and design is central to PD.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;See Birkeland, J. (2012) ‚ÄòDesign blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking‚Äô, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), pp. 163-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-making processes/tools divide, compare and choose.  They use bounded or ‚Äòclosed system‚Äô thinking which excludes considerations that are difficult to quantify.  Essentially, decision methods simplify issues and options to facilitate finding the best path from the present position or desired future.  Back-casting and scenario planning, while powerful tools, presume the future can be predicted and selected.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods decide now how future citizens must live.  They also reduce future options by narrowing resources, adaptability, space and biodiversity over time. Sustainability therefore requires rethinking decision-making and design tools from first principles.

=== Decision-making (reducing costs) ===
The reduction of the ecological base and public estate continues, PD argues, because new sustainability goals were spliced onto the old (anti-ecological) closed system models, methods and metrics of the DP.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given escalating human consumption, even global depopulation and ecological regeneration would not counterbalance total negative resource flows and ecological impacts. PD maintains that closed system models created and institutionalized zero-sum decision and measurement frameworks such as cost-benefit/risk-benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies and ‚Äòreverses‚Äô over a hundred systemic biases in governance, planning, decision and design frameworks by converting them into open system and design-based frameworks to facilitate eco-positive planning and design.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‚ÄòPositive Development and Assessment‚Äô, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environments'', 3(1), pp. 4-22;  Birkeland, J. (2015) ‚ÄòPlanning for Positive Development‚Äô, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design (multiplying benefits) ===
Whereas the internal logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries).  For example, building rating tools are based on limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains.  Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and rating tools are decision-based.  Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development.  Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;There are many critiques of green building rating tools.  Brandon, P.S., and Lombardi, P.L. (2011) ''Evaluating Sustainable Development in the Built Environment'' (2nd ed.) Chichester, West Sussex, Ames, Iowa, Wiley-Blackwell; Gu, Z., Wennersten, R., and Assefa, G. (2006) ‚ÄòAnalysis of the Most Widely Used Building Environmental Assessment Methods‚Äô, ''Environmental Sciences,'' 3(3), pp. 175-192;  Birkeland, J. (2004) ‚ÄòBuilding Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts‚Äô, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, [[Australia http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland|Australia &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (accessed 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Decision systems in governance (i.e. legislative, executive and judicial) resolve conflict by allocating rights and resources - not by increasing the ecological base and/or public estate.  Hence PD suggests different frameworks for environmental governance.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‚ÄòThe Case for a New Public Forum‚Äô, in Furnass, B., Whyte, J., Harris, J., and Baker, A. (Eds), ''Survival, Health and Wellbeing into the 21st Century'', Nature and Society Forum, pp. 111-114.  Birkeland, J. (1995) ‚ÄòEthics-Based Planning‚Äô, ''Australian Planner'' 33(1), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a modified constitution with a new decision sphere to deal with the unique ethical dimensions of biophysical development, planning and design.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1993) ‚ÄòTowards a New System of Environmental Governance‚Äô, in ''The Environmentalist'', 13(1), pp. 19-32;  Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society, Ibid''; Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Given real-world political barriers to change, PD also suggests default strategies to enable incremental reform by changing institutions from within.  PD contends that gaps can be avoided in new governance and planning systems by simply reversing each ecologically terminal convention into eco-positive ones.

== Planning ==
SMARTmode (systems mapping and redesign thinking) is a PD planning process&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 251-173.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes two dozen environment gap analyses to highlight sustainability issues that are almost never assessed in planning or design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‚ÄòPlanning for Positive Development‚Äô, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are forensic ‚Äòflows analyses‚Äô that identify (local/regional) social and ecological deficits that developments could ameliorate by design.  They can be undertaken scientifically using emerging multi-dimensional digital mapping tools,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. and Simpson, R., eds. (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth, Virtual Nations, Data Cities'', D_City, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically by design teams,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‚ÄòImproving the Design Review Process‚Äô, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‚ÄòSystems and Social Change for Sustainable and Resilient Cities‚Äô, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; or more subjectively in community ‚Äòcharrettes‚Äô (aka working bees) for workshopping planning criteria and design briefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, W. (2002) ‚ÄòPros and cons of design charrettes‚Äô, in J. Birkeland (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A Sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Until planners perform these analyses routinely, therefore, they can serve as design thinking exercises, guidelines and/or criteria.

== Design ==
While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required.  PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‚Äòlow-impact luxury‚Äô environments.&lt;ref&gt;Aesthetics or design quality does not equal high production costs, whereas high-tech equipment usually has high [[embodied energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‚Äò[[living machines]]‚Äô,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J. (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California;  J. Todd (2002) ‚ÄòLiving Technologies‚Äô, in Birkeland J. (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, pp. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mycology]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets, P. (2005) ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World'', Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äòalgaetecture‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;Algae Industry Magazine (2011), Algaeindustry.com. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‚Äòdesign for eco-services‚Äô,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‚ÄòDesign for Eco-services‚Äô, Part A - Environmental Services, ''Environment Design Guide 77'', and Part B - Building Services, ''Environmental Design Guide 78'', Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, pp. 1-13 and pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äògreen scaffolding‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‚ÄòResilient and Sustainable Buildings‚Äô, Pearson, L., Newton P., and Roberts P. (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 146-159.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äògreen space walls‚Äô,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ‚ÄòSpace Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development‚Äô, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22‚Äì25.

(Eds) ''The Natural Advantage of Nations'', London, Earthscan, pp. 367-8&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äòplaygardens‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2002) Playgardens and Community in ''Design for Sustainability; a Sourcebook of Eco-logical Solutions,'' Earthscan, London, pp. 109-112;  Birkeland, J. (1994) ‚ÄòEcofeminist Playgardens‚Äô, International Play Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Design for Eco-services ===
The term ‚Äòecosystem services‚Äô generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. (1997) ‚ÄòThe Value of the World‚ÄôsEcosystem Services and Natural Capital‚Äô, ''Nature'', vol 387, pp. 253‚Äì260;  Heal, G. (2000) ''Nature and the Marketplace: Capturing the Value of Ecosystem Services'', Island Press, Washington, DC; Folke, C. Jansson, √Ö., Larsson, J. and Costanza, R. (1997) ‚ÄòEcosystem Appropriation by Cities, Ambio Vol 26, pp. 167-172;  Daily, G. and K. Ellison (2002) ''The New Economy of Nature'', Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD uses the term ‚Äòeco-services‚Äô to include not only nature‚Äôs instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‚Äòbiophilic‚Äô values.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1993) ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'', in S. Kellert (Ed) Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD considers the value of nature to be ‚Äòinfinite‚Äô as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself.  To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development,&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, M. and Rees W. E. (1996) ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing the Human Impact on the Earth'', New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äòsurplus‚Äô natural and social capital&lt;ref&gt;Surplus in PD means ‚Äògiving back more than it takes‚Äô from a life cycle and whole system perspective, not sending energy or water back to the grid or mains.&lt;/ref&gt; - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

=== Carbon-neutral Design ===
Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics.  Moreover, calculations of ‚Äònet energy‚Äô seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation.  With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but it might be used for unsustainable purposes elsewhere. Nonetheless, a building could sequester more carbon than it emits over its life cycle with substantial building-integrated vegetation, using PD design principles.  A case study (conducted by a cross-disciplinary team) showed this would within under twelve years, well under its life span.&lt;ref&gt;Renger, C., Birkeland, J. and Midmore, D. (2015) ‚ÄòNet Positive Building Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Brisbane‚Äô, in ''Building Research and Information: Special issue'' on net positive design 43(1), pp. 11-24. See also Birkeland, J.L. (2008) ‚ÄòSpace Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development‚Äô, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22‚Äì25, http://trove.nla.gov.au/ accessed June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Reporting ===
The PD eco-positive design reporting process (EDR)&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‚ÄòImproving the Design Review Process‚Äô, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‚ÄòSystems and Social Change for Sustainable and resilient Cities‚Äô, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to avoid many shortcomings of decision-based approaches to design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 83-96. Rating tools often give credits for things that have financial gains like energy and water savings or worker health and productivity but do not increase the ecology, let alone offset biodiversity impacts. They do not credit actual net positive impacts.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to green building rating tools, the EDR aims to uncover opportunities to create net public gains.  Design teams answer questions based on PD design criteria&lt;ref&gt;''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and SMARTmode analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‚ÄòPlanning for Positive Development‚Äô, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257;  ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This forces education, collaboration and ‚Äòfrontloading‚Äô design (i.e. investing more in preliminary design stages).&lt;ref&gt;See Weizacker, E. van, Lovins, A. and Lovins, H. (1997) ''Factor 4: Doubling Wealth ‚Äì Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan, London, UK.  Hawken, P., Lovins, A and Lovins, H. (1999) ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', Earthscan, London, UK.  It is a widely cited claim that design is only about one percent of the total cost of the building, yet can save fifty to ninety percent of the total operating cost of a building.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing the research and reasoning behind decision and design concepts facilitates input from community, assessors and independent experts, and should therefore occur be undertaken in development project. Being affordable and flexible, it is also easily adapted to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;An example EDR process was created for Bogota based on a study of cultural, economic, social, ecological and other special needs.  This is not yet published.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Strategies ===
Eco-positive retrofitting is a priority PD strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‚ÄòEco-Retrofitting with Building Integrated Living‚Äô, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environment Conference Proceedings''. Delft, Netherlands. www.sasbe2009.com/ accessed May 2011; ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massive ongoing impacts of buildings, biophysical sustainability is impossible without retrofitting cities.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2013) ''Buildings and Climate Change: Summary for Decision Makers'', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi (by United Nations organizations and national building institutes).  UN-HABITAT (2011) ''Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements''. http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS2011_Full.pdf/ accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing buildings with greener ones costs too much in materials, money, energy and time, as new buildings represent only 1-3% of the building stock.  It is now accepted that retrofitting can be profitable in resource, energy, health savings and worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Romm, J. (1999) ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Emissions'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  EPA (1998) Market Values for Home Energy Efficiency (study by Nevin and Watson for the USA Environmental Protection Agency), Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; It can happen quickly and simultaneously, or when buildings are repurposed or refurbished anyway.  Green buildings may last a hundred years but few are designed for upgrading/adaptability, so they will soon need retrofitting to a higher standard.

== Design Assessment ==
Most rating tools prioritize resource efficiency and treat ‚Äòreductions in negative impacts‚Äô as if positive.  Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts.  Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social capital in the vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5466">{{for|the quotient of an [[abelian category]] by a [[Serre subcategory]]|Quotient of an abelian category}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''quotient category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] obtained from another one by identifying sets of [[morphism]]s. Formally, it is a [[quotient object]] in the [[category of small categories|category of (small) categories]], analogous to a [[quotient group]] or [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]], but in the categorical setting.

==Definition==

Let ''C'' be a category. A ''[[congruence relation]]'' ''R'' on ''C'' is given by: for each pair of objects ''X'', ''Y'' in ''C'', an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; on Hom(''X'',''Y''), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. That is, if
:&lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2 : X \to Y\,&lt;/math&gt;
are related in Hom(''X'', ''Y'') and
:&lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2 : Y \to Z\,&lt;/math&gt;
are related in Hom(''Y'', ''Z''), then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in Hom(''X'', ''Z'').

Given a congruence relation ''R'' on ''C'' we can define the '''quotient category''' ''C''/''R'' as the category whose objects are those of ''C'' and whose morphisms are [[equivalence class]]es of morphisms in ''C''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}/R}(X,Y) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/R_{X,Y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Composition of morphisms in ''C''/''R'' is [[well-defined]] since ''R'' is a congruence relation.

==Properties==

There is a natural quotient [[functor]] from ''C'' to ''C''/''R'' which sends each morphism to its equivalence class. This functor is bijective on objects and surjective on Hom-sets (i.e. it is a [[full functor]]).

Every functor ''F'' : ''C'' &amp;#x2192; ''D'' determines a congruence on ''C'' by saying ''f'' ~ ''g'' [[iff]] ''F''(''f'') = ''F''(''g''). The functor ''F'' then factors through the quotient functor ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''/~ in a unique manner. This may be regarded as the &amp;#x201C;[[first isomorphism theorem]]&amp;#x201D; for functors.

==Examples==

* [[Monoid]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s may be regarded as categories with one object. In this case the quotient category coincides with the notion of a [[quotient monoid]] or a [[quotient group]].
* The [[homotopy category of topological spaces]] '''hTop''' is a quotient category of '''Top''', the [[category of topological spaces]]. The equivalence classes of morphisms are [[homotopy class]]es of continuous maps.
*Let ''k'' be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] and consider the [[abelian category]] Mod(''k'') of all [[Vector space|vector spaces]] over ''k'' with ''k''-linear maps as morphisms. To "kill" all finite-dimensional spaces, we can call two linear maps ''f'',''g'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y'' congruent iff their difference has finite-dimensional image. In the resulting quotient category, all finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic to 0. [This is actually an example of a quotient of additive categories, see below.]

== Related concepts ==
===Quotients of additive categories modulo ideals===
If ''C'' is an [[additive category]] and we require the congruence relation ~ on ''C'' to be additive (i.e. if ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'' with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the quotient category ''C''/~ will also be additive, and the quotient functor ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''/~ will be an additive functor. 

The concept of an additive congruence relation is equivalent to the concept of a ''two-sided ideal of morphisms'': for any two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' we are given an additive subgroup ''I''(''X'',''Y'') of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''Y'') such that for all ''f'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''X'',''Y''), ''g'' &amp;isin; Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'', ''Z'') and ''h''&amp;isin; Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'', ''X''), we have ''gf'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''X'',''Z'') and ''fh'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''W'',''Y''). Two morphisms in Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''Y'') are congruent iff their difference is in ''I''(''X'',''Y'').

Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] may be viewed as an additive category with a single object, and the quotient of additive categories defined above coincides in this case with the notion of a [[quotient ring]] modulo a two-sided ideal.

===Localization of a category===
The [[localization of a category]] introduces new morphisms to turn several of the original category's morphisms into isomorphisms. This tends to increase the number of morphisms between objects, rather than decrease it as in the case of quotient categories. But in both constructions it often happens that two objects become isomorphic that weren't isomorphic in the original category. 

===Serre quotients of abelian categories===
The [[Quotient of an abelian category|Serre quotient]] of an [[abelian category]] by a [[Serre subcategory]] is a new abelian category which is similar to a quotient category but also in many cases has the character of a localization of the category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27970">'''Renewable heat''' is an application of [[renewable energy]] and it refers to the renewable generation of heat, rather than electrical power (e.g. replacing a fossil fuel boiler using [[concentrating solar thermal]] to feed radiators). Renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels, solar heating, geothermal heating, heat pumps and heat exchangers to recover lost heat. Significant attention is also applied to insulation.

Many colder countries consume more energy for heating than electrical power. For example, in 2005 the United Kingdom consumed 354&amp;nbsp;TWh&lt;ref&gt;Department of Trade and Industry report [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf UK Energy in Brief July 2007, Page 25] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233923/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; of electric power, but had a heat requirement of 907&amp;nbsp;TWh, the majority of which (81%) was met using gas. The residential sector alone consumed a massive 550&amp;nbsp;TWh of energy for heating, mainly in the form of gas. Almost half of the final energy consumed in the UK (49%) was in the form of heat, of which 70% was used by households and in commercial and public buildings. Households used heat mainly for space heating (69%) and heating water.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government Call for Evidence on Heat, Office of Climate Change, Jan 2008 [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf 'Heat Call for Evidence', Paragraphs 11 and 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233914/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation's approach to energy and environment policy. Few renewable technologies (whether for heat, electricity or transport) are competitive with fossil fuels without some form of carbon valuation or subsidy. In those countries, such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, where [[government intervention]] has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation (i.e. carbon and [[energy tax]]es), renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption. In those countries, such as Germany, Spain, the USA, and the UK, where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies, uses and scales, the  contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support, and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption.

== Leading renewable heat technologies ==

=== Solar heating ===
[[Solar heating]] is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure. The heat can be used for both [[space heating]] (see [[solar air heat]]) and [[water heating]] (see [[solar hot water]]). Solar heating design is divided into two groups:
* [[Passive solar]] heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect heat. [[Passive solar building design]] must also consider the storage and distribution of heat, which may be accomplished passively, or use air ducting to draw heat actively to the foundation of the building for storage. One such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to {{convert|24|C|F}} on a partially sunny winter day (-7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C or 19&amp;nbsp;¬∞F), and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building's heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarhouseproject.com/index.html |title=Solar House, Solar Home, Solar Homes, Solar Houses |publisher=Solarhouseproject.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home cost $125 per square foot (or 370&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at $1,351/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), similar to the cost of a traditional new home.
* [[Active solar]] heating uses [[pump]]s to move air or a liquid from the [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] into the building or storage area. Applications such as [[solar air heat]]ing and [[solar water heating]] typically capture solar heat in panels which can then be used for applications such as space heating and supplementation of residential water heaters. In contrast to [[photovoltaic panels]], which are used to generate electricity, solar heating panels are less expensive and capture a much higher proportion of the sun's energy.
Solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system, either conventional or renewable.

=== Geothermal heating ===
[[File:Hot Spring.jpg|thumb|right|Hot Springs located in Nevada.]]
[[Geothermal energy]] is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil. Geothermal energy is an enormous, underused heat and power resource that is clean (emits little or no greenhouse gases), reliable (average system availability of 95%), and homegrown (making populations less dependent on oil).&lt;ref name="EERE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|title=Geothermal Basics Overview|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|archivedate=2008-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth absorbs the sun's energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground. The ground temperature remains constant at a point of {{convert|42|to|100|F|C}} all year round depending on where you live on earth. A geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the Earth's surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings. The system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground, connected to pipes in a building. A pump circulates liquid through the circuit. In the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building. In the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |title=What is Geothermal? - Geothermal Resources Council |publisher=Geothermal.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004048/http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat pumps===
[[Heat pump]]s use work to move heat from one place to another, and can be used for both heating and air conditioning. Though capital intensive, heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity. Two common types of heat pump are [[air-source heat pump]]s (ASHP) and [[ground-source heat pump]]s (GSHP), depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground.  Air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about -15&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, while ground-source heat pumps are not affected. The efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the [[coefficient of performance]] (CoP): For every unit of electricity used to pump the heat, an air source heat pump generates 2.5 to 3 units of heat (i.e. it has a CoP of 2.5 to 3), whereas a GSHP generates 3 to 3.5 units of heat. Based on current fuel prices for the United Kingdom, assuming a CoP of 3-4, a GSHP is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric, oil, and solid fuel heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps Ground Source Heat Pumps: Costs, savings and financial support] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202165420/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps |date=December 2, 2016 }} Retrieved 2016-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps can be linked to an inter[[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (hot or cold), doubling the CoP from 4 to 8 by extracting heat from warmer ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/gshp.html |title=GSHP &amp;#124; Ground Source Heat Pumps &amp;#124; GSHPs &amp;#124; Ground Source Heating &amp;#124; Coefficient of Performance CoP &amp;#124; Ground source heat pump efficiency &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interseasonal heat transfer====
{{Main|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
A heat pump with Interseasonal Heat Transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html |title=Thermal Banks store heat between seasons &amp;#124; Seasonal Heat Storage &amp;#124; ThermalBanks from ICAX save carbon emissions &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage using Inter seasonal Heat Stores &amp;#124; Underground Thermal Energy Storage UTES &amp;#124; Reusable Heat |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter. This reduces the "Lift" needed and doubles the CoP of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground.

====CoP and lift====
A heat pump CoP increases as the temperature difference, or "Lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The CoP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g., underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g., the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional radiators require high water temperatures, affecting the choice of heat pump technology. Low temperature radiators provide an alternative to conventional radiators.

===Resistive electrical heating===
Renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and by burning biomass. In a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive, [[Electric heating|resistance heating]] is common. In countries like Denmark where electricity is expensive, it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/DEA_Heat_supply_in_denmark.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity, [[storage heater]]s consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day.

=== Wood-pellet heating ===
[[File:Lincoln stove.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Stove.]][[File:Pellets hand.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Pellets.]]
[[Wood-pellet heating]] and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid, typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal. Solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space, and the specialized heating systems can be expensive (though grant schemes are available in many European countries to offset this capital cost.) Low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in Europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than 3 to 5 years.  Because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios, or for premises connected to the gas grid (though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive.) There is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat, especially the fine particulates.

=== Wood-stove heating ===
Burning [[wood fuel]] in an open fire is both extremely inefficient (0-20%) and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion. In the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing, an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building.

Modern wood [[stove]] designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction. In the United States, new wood stoves are certified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and burn cleaner and more efficiently (the overall efficiency is 60-80%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/bns/reports/stakejun2008/B%28a%29P/WoodstoveFacsheet_08.pdf|title=Burn clean: Hot tips for a better fire|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- originally at 
http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf, and archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20090510060711/http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf should this link ever become stale --&gt; and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building.

"Cleaner" should not, however, be confused with clean. An Australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current Australian standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/atmosphere/airquality/publications/emission-factor.html |title=Measurement of real-world PM10 emission factors and emission profiles from woodheaters by in situ source monitoring and atmospheric verification methods |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that particle emissions averaged 9.4&amp;nbsp;g/kg wood burned (range 2.6 to 21.7).  A heater with average wood consumption of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6&amp;nbsp;kg of PM2.5, i.e. particles less than 2.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]]. This can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current [[European emission standards|Euro 5 standards]] (introduced September 2009) of 0.005&amp;nbsp;g/km. So one new wood heater emits as much PM2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000&amp;nbsp;km a year. A recent European study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |title=Assessment of the health impacts of exposure to PM2.5 at a European levelETC/ACC Technical Paper 2009/1 |publisher=Air-climate.eionet.europa.eu |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722210417/http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified PM2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant, causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths.  The next worst pollutant, ozone, is responsible for 21,000 premature deaths.

Because of the problems with pollution, the Australian Lung Foundation recommends using alternative means for climate control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lungfoundation.com.au/consultation-looks-at-reducing-emissions-from-wood-heaters/]{date=2014-06-01}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Lung Association "strongly recommends using cleaner, less toxic sources of heat. Converting a wood-burning fireplace or stove to use either natural gas or propane will eliminate exposure to the dangerous toxins wood burning generates including dioxin, arsenic and formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lungusa.org/press-room/press-releases/cleaner-alternatives-for-winter-heat.html |title=American Lung Association Cautions Against Wood-burning and Urges Cleaner Alternatives for Winter Heat - American Lung Association |publisher=Lungusa.org |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Renewable" should not be confused with "greenhouse neutral".  A recent peer-reviewed paper found that, even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply, [[methane emissions]] from a typical Australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global warming than heating the same house with gas.  However, because a large proportion of firewood sold in Australia is not from sustainable supplies, Australian households that use wood heating often cause more global warming than heating three similar homes with gas.&lt;ref&gt;"Australian wood heaters currently increase global warming and health costs", Dorothy L. Robinson, Atmospheric Poolution Research, Article in Press, {{doi|10.5094/APR.2011.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High efficiency stoves should meet the following design criteria:
* Well sealed and precisely calibrated to draw a low yet sufficient volume of air. Air-flow restriction is critical; a lower inflow of cold air cools the furnace less (a higher temperature is thus achieved). It also allows greater time for extraction of heat from the [[exhaust gas]], and draws less heat from the building.
* The furnace must be well insulated to increase combustion temperature, and thus completeness.
* A well insulated furnace radiates little heat. Thus heat must be extracted instead from the exhaust gas duct. Heat absorption efficiencies are higher when the heat-exchange duct is longer, and when the flow of exhaust gas is slower.
* In many designs, the heat-exchange duct is built of a very large mass of heat-absorbing brick or stone. This design causes the absorbed heat to be emitted over a longer period - typically a day.

===Renewable natural gas===
[[Renewable natural gas]] is defined as gas obtained from [[biomass]] which is upgraded to a quality similar to [[natural gas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgc.dk/publikationer/konference/jkj_sustain_gas.pdf|publisher=Dgc.dk|title='Sustainable Gas Enters the European Gas Distribution System'|accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Energy research Centre of the Netherlands, renewable natural gas is 'cheaper than alternatives where biomass is used in a combined heat and power plant or local combustion plant'.&lt;ref&gt;Energy research Centre of the Netherlands [http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2005/rx05187.pdf 'Heat from Biomass via Synthetic Natural Gas'] . Retrieved March 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy unit costs are lowered through 'favourable scale and operating hours', and end-user capital costs eliminated through distribution via the existing gas grid.

==Energy efficiency==
Renewable heat goes hand in hand with energy efficiency. Indeed, renewable heating projects depend heavily for their success on energy efficiency; in the case of solar heating to cut reliance on the requirement supplementary heating, in the case of wood fuel heating to cut the cost of wood purchased and volume stored, and in the case of heat pumps to reduce the size and investment in heat pump, heat sink and electricity costs.

Two main types of improvement can be made to a building's energy efficiency:

===Insulation===
Improvements to insulation can cut energy consumption greatly, making a space cheaper to heat and to cool. However existing housing can often be difficult or expensive to improve. Newer buildings can benefit from many of the techniques of [[superinsulation]]. Older buildings can benefit from several kinds of improvement:

* '''Solid wall insulation''': A building with solid walls can benefit from internal or external insulation. External wall insulation involves adding decorative weather-proof insulating panels or other treatment to the outside of the wall. Alternatively, internal wall insulation can be applied using ready-made insulation/plaster board laminates, or other methods. Thicknesses of internal or external insulation typically range between 50 and 100&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''Cavity wall insulation''': A building with cavity walls can benefit from insulation pumped into the cavity. This form of insulation is very cost effective{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.
* '''[[Programmable thermostat]]s''' allow heating and cooling of a room to be switched off depending the time, day of the week, and temperature. A bedroom, for example, does not need to be heated during the day, but a living room does not need to be heated during the night.
* '''Roof insulation'''
* '''Insulated windows and doors'''
* '''Draught proofing'''

=== Underfloor heating ===
[[Underfloor heating]] may sometimes be more energy efficient than traditional methods of heating:

* Water circulates within the system at low temperatures (35&amp;nbsp;¬∞C - 50&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) making gas boilers, wood fired boilers, and heat pumps significantly more efficient.
* Rooms with underfloor heating are cooler near the ceiling, where heat is not required, but warmer underfoot, where comfort is most required.
* Traditional radiators are frequently positioned underneath poorly insulated windows, heating them unnecessarily.

=== Waste-water heat recovery ===
[[File:Hot water heat recycling unit.jpg|thumb|right|Recycling heat.]]
It is possible to recover significant amounts of heat from waste hot water via [[hot water heat recycling]]. Major consumption of hot water is sinks, showers, baths, dishwashers, and clothes washers. On average 30% of a property's domestic hot water is used for showering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47685.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming fresh water is typically of a far lower temperature than the waste water from a shower. An inexpensive heat exchanger recovers up on average 40% of the heat that would normally be wasted, by warming incoming cold fresh water with heat from outgoing waste water.

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''risk aversion''' is the behavior of [[human]]s (especially [[consumer]]s and [[investor]]s), who, when exposed to [[uncertainty]], attempt to lower that uncertainty. It is the hesitation of a person to agree to a situation with an unknown payoff rather than another situation with a more predictable payoff but possibly lower [[expected value|expected payoff]]. For example, a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a [[bank]] account with a low but guaranteed interest rate, rather than into a [[stock]] that may have high expected returns, but also involves a chance of losing value.

A person is given the choice between two scenarios, one with a guaranteed payoff and one without. In the guaranteed scenario, the person receives $50. In the uncertain scenario, a coin is flipped to decide whether the person receives $100 or nothing. The expected payoff for both scenarios is $50, meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble. However, individuals may have different '''risk attitudes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mr Lev Virine|author2=Mr Michael Trumper|title=ProjectThink: Why Good Managers Make Poor Project Choices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NCjAgAAQBAJ|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hillson|author2=Ruth Murray-Webster|title=Understanding and Managing Risk Attitude|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeMdki1LYEUC|year=2007|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-566-08798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adhikari|first= Binay K|last2= Agrawal|first2= Anup |title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?|journal=[[Journal of Corporate Finance]] |volume=38|year=2016|pages=272‚Äì293|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person is said to be:

* '''risk averse''' (or '''risk avoiding''') - if they would accept a certain payment ([[certainty equivalent]]) of less than $50 (for example, $40), rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing.
* '''[[risk neutral]]''' - if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain $50 payment.
* '''[[risk loving]]''' (or '''risk seeking''') - if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than $50 (for example, $60).

The average payoff of the gamble, known as its [[expected value]], is $50. The smallest dollar amount that the individual would accept instead of the bet is called the [[certainty equivalent]], and the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent is called the [[risk premium]]. For risk-averse individuals, it is positive, for risk-neutral persons it is zero, and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative.

==Utility of money==
In [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] theory, an agent has a utility function ''u''(''c'') where ''c'' represents the value that he might receive in money or goods (in the above example ''c'' could be $0 or $40 or $100).

The utility function ''u''(''c'') is defined only [[up to]] positive [[affine transformation]] ‚Äì in other words, a constant could be added to the value of ''u''(''c'') for all ''c'', and/or ''u''(''c'') could be multiplied by a positive constant factor, without affecting the conclusions.

An agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is [[concave function|concave]].  For instance ''u''(0) could be 0, ''u''(100) might be 10, ''u''(40) might be 5, and for comparison ''u''(50) might be 6.

The expected utility of the above bet (with a 50% chance of receiving 100 and a 50% chance of receiving 0) is

:&lt;math&gt;E(u)=(u(0)+u(100))/2&lt;/math&gt;,

and if the person has the utility function with ''u''(0)=0, ''u''(40)=5, and ''u''(100)=10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5, which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40.  Hence the certainty equivalent is 40.

The risk premium is ($50 minus $40)=$10, or in proportional terms

:&lt;math&gt;(\$50-\$40)/\$40&lt;/math&gt;

or 25% (where $50 is the expected value of the risky bet: (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} 0 + \tfrac{1}{2} 100&lt;/math&gt;).  This risk premium means that the person would be willing to sacrifice as much as $10 in expected value in order to achieve perfect certainty about how much money will be received.  In other words, the person would be indifferent between the bet and a guarantee of $40, and would prefer anything over $40 to the bet.

In the case of a wealthier individual, the risk of losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility function would be likely to be almost linear, for instance if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4.0001 and u(50) might be 5.0001.

The utility function for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope implies that the person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is [[stochastic dominance#First-order stochastic dominance|first-order stochastically dominant]] over an alternative bet (that is, if the probability mass of the second bet is pushed to the right to form the first bet, then the first bet is preferred).  (ii) The concavity of the utility function implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is a [[mean-preserving spread|mean-preserving contraction]] of an alternative bet (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first bet is spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first bet is preferred).

==&lt;span id="Measures of risk aversion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Measures of risk aversion under expected utility theory==
There are multiple measures of the risk aversion expressed by a given utility function. Several functional forms often used for utility functions are expressed in terms of these measures.

===Absolute risk aversion===
The higher the curvature of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;, the higher the risk aversion. However, since expected utility functions are not uniquely defined (are defined only up to [[affine transformations]]), a measure that stays constant with respect to these transformations is needed. One such measure is the '''Arrow‚ÄìPratt measure of absolute risk aversion''' (ARA), after the economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]],&lt;ref name="Arrow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arrow |first=K. J. |year=1965 |title=The Theory of Risk Aversion|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnNEAAAAIAAJ|chapter=Aspects of the Theory of Risk Bearing |publisher=Yrjo Jahnssonin Saatio |location=Helsinki }} Reprinted in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkMoAQAAMAAJ ''Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing''], Markham Publ. Co., Chicago, 1971, 90‚Äì109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J. W. |title=Risk Aversion in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=32 |issue=1‚Äì2 |year=1964 |pages=122‚Äì136 |jstor=1913738 |doi=10.2307/1913738}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''coefficient of absolute risk aversion''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u'(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u''(c)&lt;/math&gt; denote the first and second derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

The following expressions relate to this term:
* [[Exponential utility]] of the form &lt;math&gt;u(c)=1-e^{-\alpha c}&lt;/math&gt; is unique in exhibiting ''constant absolute risk aversion'' (CARA): &lt;math&gt;A(c)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is constant with respect to ''c''.
* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]] (HARA) is the most general class of utility functions that are usually used in practice (specifically, CRRA (constant relative risk aversion, see below), CARA (constant absolute risk aversion), and quadratic utility all exhibit HARA and are often used because of their mathematical tractability). A utility function exhibits HARA if its absolute risk aversion is a [[hyperbolic function]], namely

:&lt;math&gt; A(c) = -\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}=\frac{1}{ac+b}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this differential equation (omitting additive and multiplicative constant terms, which do not affect the behavior implied by the utility function) is:

:&lt;math&gt; u(c) = \frac{(c-c_s)^{1-R}}{1-R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R=1/a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c_s = -b/a &lt;/math&gt;.
Note that when &lt;math&gt; a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CARA, as &lt;math&gt; A(c) = 1/b = const &lt;/math&gt;, and when &lt;math&gt; b=0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CRRA (see below), as &lt;math&gt; c A(c) = 1/a = const &lt;/math&gt;.
See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/zender/Fin7330/1-RiskAversion.doc |title=Zender's lecture notes |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Decreasing/increasing absolute risk aversion'' (DARA/IARA) is present if &lt;math&gt;A(c)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing/increasing. Using the above definition of ARA, the following inequality holds for DARA:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial A(c)}{\partial c} = -\frac{u'(c)u'''(c) - [u''(c)]^2}{[u'(c)]^2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

and this can hold only if &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, DARA implies that the utility function is positively skewed; that is, &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Haim |last=Levy |year=2006 |title=Stochastic Dominance: Investment Decision Making under Uncertainty |location=New York |publisher=Springer |edition=Second |isbn=0-387-29302-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, IARA can be derived with the opposite directions of inequalities, which permits but does not require a negatively skewed utility function (&lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;). An example of a DARA utility function is &lt;math&gt;u(c)=\log(c)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; A(c)=1/c&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;u(c)=c-\alpha c^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A(c)=2 \alpha/(1-2 \alpha c)&lt;/math&gt; would represent a quadratic utility function exhibiting IARA.
*Experimental and empirical evidence is mostly consistent with decreasing absolute risk aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friend |first=Irwin |last2=Blume |first2=Marshall |year=1975 |title=The Demand for Risky Assets |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=900‚Äì922 |jstor=1806628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contrary to what several empirical studies have assumed, wealth is not a good proxy for risk aversion when studying risk sharing in a principal-agent setting. Although &lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt; is monotonic in wealth under either DARA or IARA and constant in wealth under CARA, tests of contractual risk sharing relying on wealth as a proxy for absolute risk aversion are usually not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellemare |first=Marc F. |first2=Zachary S. |last2=Brown |title=On the (Mis)Use of Wealth as a Proxy for Risk Aversion |journal=[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]] |year=2010 |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=273‚Äì282 |doi=10.1093/ajae/aap006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative risk aversion===
The '''Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion''' (RRA) or '''coefficient of relative risk aversion''' is defined as&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon, Carl and Lawrence Blume|title=Mathematics for Economists|publisher=Viva Norton|isbn=978-81-309-1600-2|pages=363|edition=Student}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(c) = cA(c)=\frac{-cu''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Like for absolute risk aversion, the corresponding terms ''constant relative risk aversion'' (CRRA) and ''decreasing/increasing relative risk aversion'' (DRRA/IRRA) are used. This measure has the advantage that it is still a valid measure of risk aversion, even if the utility function changes from risk averse to risk loving as ''c'' varies, i.e. utility is not strictly convex/concave over all ''c''.  A constant RRA implies a decreasing ARA, but the reverse is not always true.  As a specific example of constant relative risk aversion, the utility function &lt;math&gt;u(c) = \log(c)&lt;/math&gt; implies RRA = 1.

In [[intertemporal choice]] problems, the [[elasticity of intertemporal substitution]] often cannot be disentangled from the coefficient of relative risk aversion.  The [[isoelastic utility]] function
:&lt;math&gt;u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\rho}-1}{1-\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits constant relative risk aversion with &lt;math&gt;R(c) = \rho &lt;/math&gt; and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{u(c)} = 1/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\rho = 1,&lt;/math&gt; using [[l'H√¥pital's rule]] shows that this simplifies to the case of ''log utility,'' ''u''(''c'') = log ''c'', and the [[income effect]] and [[substitution effect]] on saving exactly offset.

A time-varying relative risk aversion can be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benchimol |first=J. |year=2014 |title=Risk aversion in the Eurozone |journal=[[Research in Economics]] |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=39‚Äì56 |doi=10.1016/j.rie.2013.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications of increasing/decreasing absolute and relative risk aversion===

The most straightforward implications of increasing or decreasing absolute or relative risk aversion, and the ones that motivate a focus on these concepts, occur in the context of forming a portfolio with one risky asset and one risk-free asset.&lt;ref name="Arrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;  If the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''number of dollars'' of the risky asset held in the portfolio if ''absolute'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).  Thus economists avoid using utility functions such as the quadratic, which exhibit increasing absolute risk aversion, because they have an unrealistic behavioral implication.

Similarly, if the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''fraction'' of the portfolio held in the risky asset if ''relative'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).

In one [[economic model|model]] in [[monetary economics]], an increase in relative risk aversion increases the impact of  households' money holdings on the overall economy. In other words, the more the relative risk aversion increases, the more money demand shocks will impact the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Benchimol, J., Four√ßans, A. (2012), [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jmacro/v34y2012i1p95-111.html Money and risk in a DSGE framework : A Bayesian application to the Eurozone], [[Journal of Macroeconomics]], vol. 34, pp. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portfolio theory===

In [[modern portfolio theory]], risk aversion is measured as the additional expected reward an investor requires to accept additional risk. Here risk is measured as the [[standard deviation]] of the return on investment, i.e. the [[square root]] of its [[variance]]. In advanced portfolio theory, different kinds of risk are taken into consideration. They are measured as the [[n-th root]] of the n-th [[central moment]]. The symbol used for risk aversion is A or A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sqrt[n]{\mu_n}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion==
The notion of using expected utility theory to analyze risk aversion has come under criticism from [[behavioral economics]]. [[Matthew Rabin]] has showed that a risk-averse, expected-utility-maximizing individual who,

''from any initial wealth level [...] turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50% probability [...] will turn down 50-50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of money.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabin |first=Matthew |year=2000 |title=Risk Aversion and Expected-Utility Theory: A Calibration Theorem |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1281‚Äì1292 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility. One solution to the problem observed by Rabin is that proposed by [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]], where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than to consider only the final wealth.

Another limitation is the reflection effect which demonstrates the reversing of risk aversion. This effect was first presented by [[Kahneman]] and [[Tversky]] as a part of the [[prospect theory]], in the [[behavioral economics]] domain.
The reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative prospects as opposed to positive prospects. According to this effect, people tend to avoid risks under the gain domain, and to seek risks under the loss domain. Meaning, no risk aversion is expected under the loss domain.&lt;ref name="j1914185"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk|journal=Econometrica|date=1979|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263‚Äì291|jstor=1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the gain domain, most people prefer a certain gain of 3000, than a gain of 4000 with a risk of 80 percent. When posing the same problem under the loss domain - with negative values, most people prefer a loss of 4000 with 80 percent chance, over a certain loss of 3000.

The reflection effect (as well as the [[certainty effect]]) is inconsistent with the expected utility hypothesis. It is assumed that the psychological principle which stands behind this kind of behavior is the overweighting of certainty. Meaning, options which are perceived as certain, are over-weighted relative to uncertain options. This pattern is an indication of a risk seeking behavior in negative prospects and eliminates other explanations for the certainty effect such as aversion for uncertainty or variability.&lt;ref name="j1914185"/&gt;

The initial findings regarding the reflection effect faced criticism regarding its validity, as it was claimed that there are insufficient evidence to support the effect on the individual level. Subsequently, an extensive investigation revealed its possible limitations, suggesting that the effect is most prevalent when either small or large amounts and extreme probabilities are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hershey|first1=J. C.|last2=Schoemaker|first2=P.

==In the brain==
{{Main|Risk aversion (psychology)}}

Attitudes towards risk have attracted the interest of the field of [[neuroeconomics]] and [[behavioral economics]].  A 2009 study by Christopoulos et al. suggested that the activity of a specific brain area (right inferior frontal gyrus) correlates with risk aversion, with more risk averse participants (i.e. those having higher risk premia) also having higher responses to safer options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2009 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469‚Äì6472 |title= Neural Correlates of Value, Risk, and Risk Aversion Contributing to Decision Making under Risk. |vauthors=Christopoulos GI, Tobler PN, Bossaerts P, Dolan RJ, Schultz W |pmid= 16775134 |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result coincides with other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2006 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469‚Äì6472

==Public understanding and risk in social activities==
In the real world, many government agencies, e.g. [[Health and Safety Executive]], are fundamentally risk-averse in their mandate. This often means that they demand (with the power of legal enforcement) that risks be minimized, even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity.
It is important to consider the [[opportunity cost]] when mitigating a risk; the cost of not taking the risky action. Writing laws focused on the risk without the  balance of the utility may misrepresent society's goals. The public understanding of risk, which influences political decisions, is an area which has recently been recognised as deserving focus. In 2007 [[Cambridge University]] initiated the [[Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk]], a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder, [[David Spiegelhalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=CAM - the Cambridge Alumni Magazine |publisher=The University of Cambridge Development Office |volume=58 | date=2009|url=http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |page=3 |title=Don's Diary |first=David |last=Spiegelhalter |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309004415/http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's services such as [[school]]s and [[playground]]s have become the focus of much risk-averse planning, meaning that children are often prevented from benefiting from activities that they would otherwise have had. Many playgrounds have been fitted with impact-absorbing matting surfaces. However, these are only designed to save children from death in the case of direct falls on their heads and do not achieve their main goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No fear: Growing up in a Risk Averse society|first=Tim|last=Gill|year=2007|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|page=81|isbn=9781903080085|url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306114126/http://gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are expensive, meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways (such as building a playground closer to the child's home, reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it), and‚Äîsome argue‚Äîchildren may attempt more dangerous acts, with confidence in the artificial surface. Shiela Sage, an early years school advisor, observes "Children who are only ever kept in very safe places, are not the ones who are able to solve problems for themselves. Children need to have a certain amount of risk taking ... so they'll know how to get out of situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Early Years - The Outdoor Environment |publisher=Teachers TV |date=10 January 2006 |url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/214 |people=Sue Durant, Sheila Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[MMR vaccine|vaccine]] to protect children against the three common diseases measles, mumps and rubella was developed and recommended for all children in several countries including the UK. However, a [[MMR vaccine controversy|controversy]] arose around fraudulent allegations that it caused autism. This alleged causal link was thoroughly disproved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2002 |volume=347 |issue=19 |pages=1477‚Äì82 |title= A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism |vauthors=Madsen KM, Hviid A, Vestergaard M |pmid=12421889 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa021134 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the doctor who made the claims was expelled from the [[General Medical Council]]. Even years after the claims were disproved, some parents wanted to avert the risk of causing autism in their own children. They chose to spend significant amounts of their own money on alternatives from private doctors. These alternatives carried their own risks which were not balanced fairly, most often that the children were not properly immunized against the more common diseases of measles, mumps and rubella.

[[Mobile phone]]s may carry some small&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=2008-01-19|date= 2005-12-05|work= Online Q&amp;A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile telephones and their base stations|accessdate=2008-01-19|date=June 2000|work= Fact sheet N¬∞193|publisher= World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health risk]]. While most people would accept that unproven risk to gain the benefit of improved communication, others remain so risk averse that they do not. (The [[COSMOS cohort study]] continues to study the actual risks of mobile phones.)

One experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the TV show [[Deal or No Deal]] finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory. In the laboratory treatments, subjects made decisions in a standard, computerized laboratory setting as typically employed in behavioral experiments. In the limelight treatments, subjects made their choices in a simulated game show environment, which included a live audience, a game show host, and video cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baltussen |first=Guido |last2=van den Assem |first2=Martijn | last3=van Dolder |first3=Dennie |title=Risky Choice in the Limelight |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |ssrn=2057134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, studies on investor behavior find that investors trade more and more speculatively after switching from phone-based to online trading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Barber|first= Brad |last2= Odean |first2= Terrance |title=The Internet and the Investor |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2001|pages=41‚Äì54 |doi=10.1257/jep.15.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Barber|first= Brad |last2= Odean |first2= Terrance |title=Online Investors: Do the Slow Die First? |journal=[[Review of Financial Studies]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |year=2002|pages=455‚Äì488 |doi=10.1093/rfs/15.2.455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that investors tend to keep their core investments with traditional brokers and use a small fraction of their wealth to speculate online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Konana|first= Prabhudev |last2= Balasubramanian |first2= Sridhar |title=The Social‚ÄìEconomic‚ÄìPsychological model of technology adoption and usage: an application to online investing |journal=[[Decision Support Systems]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=2005|pages=505‚Äì524 |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rugby union]] and [[apartheid]]''' had a complex relationship. From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of [[rugby within South Africa]] drew frequent controversy. [[South African Rugby Board|South Africa]] remained a member of the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.

[[Halt All Racist Tours]] was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. South Africa toured [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]]. [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] were excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]]. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] to go under the status of '[[honorary whites]]'.

No other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with [[rugby league]] over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.

The issue affected not only black South Africans, but also [[MƒÅori people|indigenous New Zealanders]] and to a lesser extent [[indigenous Australians]]. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as {{nrut|Fiji}} would be frowned upon.

The famous Scottish rugby commentator, [[Bill McLaren]], devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, ''Talking of Rugby'', called "Barred from the International Feast". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's "''unacceptable racist policy''", but adds "''it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.''"&lt;ref name=mclaren&gt;McLaren, p145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]], documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity:

{{quote|The Springboks had fulfilled all of their touring commitments through the Fifties and Sixties but the oppressive, claustrophobic political pressures overwhelmed them during the Seventies. They have not been able to play in Britain, Ireland, France or Australia since 1974, and their only major tour abroad in the last ten years to New Zealand in 1981, was full of controversy, and mass demonstrations. There is no doubt that giant steps have been taken to make Rugby totally integrated in South Africa in recent years, and their supporters feel that no sooner have they fulfilled the conditions required of them by world opinion than the goalposts are moved.

Their opponents, who are against having any sporting links with a country which practises apartheid, accept that sport in South Africa has become increasingly integrated but claim it is impossible to have normal sport in an abnormal society.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112-3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|to New Zealand in 1981]].

==Governing bodies==
Like most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:

* The [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) for whites,&lt;ref name=Hopkins20&gt;Hopkins, p20&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[South African Rugby Football Federation|South African Rugby Federation]] (SARF) for "coloureds" i.e. people considered to be of mixed race.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;
* The [[South African African Rugby Board|South African Rugby Association]] (SARA) (originally the South African African Rugby Board) for blacks.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

There was also the [[South African Rugby Union (SACOS)|South African Rugby Union]] (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt; However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.

At the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

==British and Irish Lions==
The [[British and Irish Lions]] were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.

In the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]], [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]] and one final one in [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|1980]]. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|1997 tour]] when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.

The Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the [[South African Rugby Board]] announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's [[apartheid]] policies including a potential boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by [[Clive Rowlands]] and coached by [[Mick Doyle (rugby union)|Mick Doyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths|first=John|title=The Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career and Shane Williams' try-scoring rate|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/155605.html#|work=espnscrum.com|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the British and Irish Lions|year=2005|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-84596-030-0|pages=202|author=Clem Thomas|author-link=Clem Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MƒÅori and apartheid==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:NoMaorisNoTour.jpg|thumb|left|Early activism over the issue of sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa]] --&gt;
New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with [[South Africa]], especially through [[rugby union]]. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] players, since the [[apartheid]] political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that MƒÅori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being MƒÅori, this was agreed to, and MƒÅori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some MƒÅori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at MƒÅori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group [[Halt All Racist Tours]] was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which MƒÅori were central, and MƒÅori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by [[PƒÅkehƒÅ]] (white New Zealanders).

In 1973 a proposed [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race [[All Black]] team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and [[civil disobedience]]. Although PƒÅkehƒÅ continued to dominate the movement, MƒÅori were prominent within it, and in [[Auckland]] formed the [[patu]] squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.

During and after the Tour, many MƒÅori protesters questioned PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly PƒÅkehƒÅ prejudice and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

==1950s==
South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.

In April 2010 it was revealed by [[Muru Walters]] that in 1956 [[Ernest Corbett]], [[Minister of MƒÅori Affairs]], had told the [[New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team|MƒÅori All Blacks]] to deliberately lose to the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] "for the future of rugby". The MƒÅori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated MƒÅori rugby players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10638078|title=Rugby: Maori told to throw match against Boks|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==
Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd|Verwoerd]] barred a [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] player from touring South Africa with the [[All Blacks]], and the tour was cancelled. [[New Zealand]] made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.

In 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations.

In 1963, [[Lloyd McDermott]], the first Australian aborigine on the {{nrut|Australia}} team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to [[rugby league]] as a result.

[[B. J. Vorster]] took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a [[Cape Coloured|Coloured]] South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, "Dolly" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]] describes the scene at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1970s==
[[Image:Danie Craven statue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of [[Danie Craven]] in [[Stellenbosch]].]]
[[File:Chris Laidlaw (422399075).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Chris Laidlaw]], former All Black, politician and fierce critic of apartheid.]]

In March 1973, the Argentine government and the [[Union Argentina de Rugby]] had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to [[San Isidro Club]] to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to [[South Africa]] by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.

South Africa was the indirect cause of the [[1976 Olympic boycott]]. A [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa]] prompted African countries to demand that the [[New Zealand at the 1976 Summer Olympics|New Zealand Olympic team]] be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that [[rugby union]] was not an [[Olympic sport]] and the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] was not affiliated to the [[New Zealand Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Espy 181, pp.157‚Äì8&lt;/ref&gt; Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.

In February, 1977, [[Danie Craven]] flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour of South Africa in 1980.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, some, such as [[Chris Laidlaw]], later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Times have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf ‚Äì a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Laidlaw|Laidlaw, Chris]] ''From Twickers with Love: Rugby's Universal Message'' in Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. [[Bill McLaren]] thought apartheid was "unacceptable", but:

{{quote|...some of the actions adopted by those aiming to stop tours were despicable.

Bette [Bill McLaren's wife] and I were referred to as 'racist scum' on our way down to Mansfield Park to see the South African Barbarians play in 1979 ‚Äì a tour party comprising equal numbers of coloureds, blacks and whites. That, said the protesters, was just window dressing. When the Springboks last toured the UK, I was asked to provide commentary on their match against the Midland Counties (East) at Welford Road, [[Leicester]]. I remember having to walk the gauntlet up a narrow channel lined on each side by policemen holding back the mob. Those policemen were covered in spittle, had hats knocked off, were kicked in places where no man should be kicked, and yet took it all with stoic calm. I couldn't believe that people in the British Isles would behaved in that manner.... Constant noise outside the South Africans' hotels to try and prevent them sleeping was another unbelievable ploy that sickened decent people.&lt;ref name=Mclaren2&gt;McLaren, p137-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1980s==
Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches [[Rest of the World XV|in Cardiff]] and [[Overseas Unions rugby union team|in London]] marking the IRB centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starmer-Smith|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Starmer-Smith|title=Rugby - A Way of Life, An Illustrated History of Rugby|year=1986 |publisher=Lennard Books|isbn=0-7126-2662-X|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa was excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]].

In 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the [[Falklands War]].

The {{nrut|Soviet Union}} supposedly turned down its invitation to the [[1987 Rugby World Cup]], because of its distaste for the ''[[apartheid]]'' regime of [[South Africa]]. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa.&lt;ref name=GSE1&gt;Sorokin, px&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited.&lt;ref name=ThauSovRug2&gt;Thau, ''Soviet Rugby'', p 47&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose ''apartheid'' in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.&lt;ref name=Cambridge494&gt;Cambridge, p494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years, [[Albert Ferasse|Ferasse]] has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the {{nrut|France}} v. {{nrut|USSR}} match in [[Toulouse]] in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, P24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1981, {{nrut|South Africa}} was due to play the Mid-West in [[Chicago]]. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.&lt;ref name=RugbyDis1&gt;Cotton, p29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 a [[World XV]], sanctioned by the IRB and funded by [[South African Breweries]], played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at [[Newlands Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]] and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in [[Johannesburg]] .

====South Africa in New Zealand, 1981====
{{main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour}}
[[File:1981-springbok-tour-auckland-kingsland-station.jpg|thumb|right|Police officers guarding a barbed wire perimeter around [[Eden Park]] near [[Kingsland railway station, New Zealand|Kingsland railway station]] in New Zealand.]]

The 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260&gt;Griffiths, p260-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Two games had to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at [[Timaru]] was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

The final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the "Crazy [[Biggles]] Test". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; All-Black prop [[Gary Knight (rugby player)|Gary Knight]] was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

Musician [[Bruce Russell (musician)|Bruce Russell]] received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Luke|title=The Aesthetics of Distribution: a conversation with Bruce Russell|url=http://www.audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|work=The National Grid|accessdate=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209182453/http://audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|archive-date=9 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the [[University of Otago]] at the time.

It was a tight game, with [[Allan Hewson]], the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25‚Äì22.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The role of the [[NZ police]] also became more controversial as a result of the tour.

The [[NZRFU]] constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|Two lawyers successfully sued it]], claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.

====New Zealand Cavaliers====
A "rebel tour" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour ‚Äì A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.

The All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the [[apartheid]] r√©gime (1990‚Äì1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]] but often advertised in [[South Africa]] as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.

Of the 30 players who had been selected for the [[All Blacks|All Black]] tour, only [[David Kirk]] and [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments&amp;mdash;a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/cavaliers-rugby-tour-1985]

On their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the "Baby Blacks". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.

====[[South American Jaguars]]====
The Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.

While many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by [[Union Argentina de Rugby]], a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and [[Rhodesia]]n ones, due to the politics of those countries.  This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the ''Pumas'' to play a match in Rhodesia during the [[1971 Argentina rugby union tour of South Africa|tour in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf Union Argentina dr Rugby Memorias 1971] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101073132/http://uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf |date=2012-11-01 }} pag.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-apartheid era==

===[[1995 Rugby World Cup]]===
{{see also|Presidency of Nelson Mandela}}
After his election in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the [[South African national rugby union team|Springboks]], as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].

Prior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.

During the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]]. They then met [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Final|1995 Rugby World Cup Final]] at [[Ellis Park Stadium]]. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a [[drop goal]] from [[Joel Stransky]].

During the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the [[Webb Ellis Cup]] while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.

This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as [[F.W. de Klerk]] later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=525‚Äì527}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2008|archivedate=25 February 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlM6rLh?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}; {{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/portal/2007/10/19/ftmandela119.xml |title=How Nelson Mandela won the rugby World Cup |date=19 October 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 October 2008 |first=John |last=Carlin |archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlMWoPg?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634426/How-Nelson-Mandela-won-the-rugby-World-Cup.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, [[Winnie Mandela|Winnie]], accused the [[ANC]] of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=491, 496, 524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=517, 536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation'', that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid South Africa]]. Carlin sold the film rights to [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref name=KellerB-NYTBR-2008-08-17&gt;Keller, Bill. ‚Äì "Entering the Scrum". ‚Äì ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. ‚Äì 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the 2009 film [[Invictus (film)|''Invictus'']],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1057500/ ''The Human Factor'']. ‚Äì IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] and starring Freeman as [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Matt Damon]] as Pienaar.&lt;ref name=KellerB-NYTBR-2008-08-17 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Matt Dawson met Matt Damon and Francois Pienaar|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8492290.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sa·πÉsƒÅra.jpg|thumb|Symbolic depiction of Sa·πÉsƒÅra]]

'''''Sa·πÉsƒÅra''''' ('''transmigration''') in [[Jain philosophy]], refers to the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and [[reincarnation]]s in various realms of existence. {{IAST|[[Sa·πÉsƒÅra]]}} is described as mundane existence, full of suffering and misery and hence is considered undesirable and worth [[renunciation]]. The ''Sa·πÉsƒÅra'' is without any beginning and the [[Jƒ´va (Jainism)|soul]] finds itself in bondage with its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] since the beginning-less time. ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' is the only way to be liberated from ''sa·πÉsƒÅra''.

== Influx of karmas (''asrava'')==
According to the Jain text, [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|(There are two kinds of influx, namely) that of persons with passions, which extends transmigration, and that of persons free from passions, which prevents or shortens it.|''TattvƒÅrths≈´tra'' (6-4-81){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81}}}}

Activities that lead to the influx of karmas (''[[asrava]]'') which extends transmigration are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81-82}}
*Five senses
*Four passions (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasƒÅya]]'')
**Anger
**Ego
**Deceit
**Greed
*The non-observance of the five vows
*Non-observance of the twenty-five activities like Righteousness 

;''Sa·πÉsƒÅra bhavanƒÅ''

Jain texts prescribe meditation on twelve forms of reflection (''bhƒÅvanƒÅ'') for those who wish to stop the above described ''asrava''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}} One such reflection is ''Sa·πÉsƒÅra bhavanƒÅ''.
It has been described in one of the Jain text, ''[[SarvƒÅrthasiddhi]]'' as:{{quote|Transmigration is the attainment of another birth by the self owing to the ripening of karmas. The five kinds of whirling round have been described already. He, who wanders in the endless cycle of births and deaths, undergoing millions of afflictions in innumerable wombs and families, takes different relationships such as father, brother, son, grandson, etc, or mother, sister, wife, daughter and so on, being propelled by the mechanism of karmas. The master becomes servant and the servant master, just as an actor acts several parts on the stage. To be brief, sometimes one becomes one‚Äôs own son. There is no end to the transformations undergone by the self owing to the influence of karmas. Thus to reflect on the nature of mundane existence is contemplation on worldly existence. He who contemplates thus is alarmed at the miseries of transmigration and becomes disgusted with worldly existence. And he who is disgusted with it endeavours to free himself from it.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=246}}}}

[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th century Jain writer in his book ''The Practical Dharma'' wrote:
{{cquote|Endless is the cycle of transmigration; painful is every form of life; there is no happiness in any of the four conditions of existence; devas, human beings, animals and residents of hells are all involved in pain and misery of some kind or other; moksha alone is blissful and free from pain; the wise should, therefore, only aspire for moksha; all other conditions are temporary and painful."{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}}}}

Given a [[size pair]]  &lt;math&gt;(M,f)\ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold]] of dimension
&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\ &lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary real [[continuous function]]  defined
on it, the &lt;math&gt;i\ &lt;/math&gt;-th '' size functor'',&lt;ref name="CaFePo01"&gt;Francesca Cagliari, Massimo Ferri, Paola Pozzi, ''Size functions from a categorical viewpoint'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 67(3):225-235, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i=0,\ldots,n\ &lt;/math&gt;, denoted
by &lt;math&gt;F_i\ &lt;/math&gt;, is the [[functor]] in &lt;math&gt;Fun(\mathrm{Rord},\mathrm{Ab})\ &lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Rord}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of  ordered real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ab}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[Abelian groups]], defined in the following way. For &lt;math&gt;x\le y\ &lt;/math&gt;, setting  &lt;math&gt;M_x=\{p\in M:f(p)\le x\}\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_y=\{p\in M:f(p)\le y\}\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; equal to the inclusion from &lt;math&gt;M_x\ &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;M_y\ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; k_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; equal to the [[morphism]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Rord}\ &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x\ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y\ &lt;/math&gt;,

* for each &lt;math&gt;x\in\R\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_i(x)=H_i(M_x);\ &lt;/math&gt;
*   &lt;math&gt;F_i(k_{xy})=H_i(j_{xy}).\ &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the size functor  studies the
process of the birth and death of homology classes as the lower level set changes.
When &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; is smooth and compact and &lt;math&gt;f\ &lt;/math&gt; is a Morse function, the functor &lt;math&gt;F_0\ &lt;/math&gt; can be
described by oriented trees, called &lt;math&gt;H_0\ &lt;/math&gt; ‚àí trees.

The concept of size functor was introduced as an extension to [[homology theory]] and [[category theory]] of the idea of [[size function]].  The main motivation for introducing the size functor originated  by the observation that the [[size function]] &lt;math&gt;\ell_{(M,f)}(x, y)\ &lt;/math&gt; can be seen as the rank
of the image of &lt;math&gt;H_0(j_{xy}) : H_0(M_x) \rightarrow H_0(M_y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The concept of size functor is strictly related to the concept of [[persistent homology group]]
,&lt;ref name="EdLeZo02"&gt;[[Herbert Edelsbrunner]], David Letscher, Afra Zomorodian, ''Topological Persistence and Simplification'', Discrete and Computational Geometry, 28(4):511-533, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
studied in [[persistent homology]]. It is worth to point out that the &lt;math&gt;i\ &lt;/math&gt;-th persistent homology group coincides with the image of the [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(k_{xy})=H_i(j_{xy}): H_i(M_x) \rightarrow H_i(M_y)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12823">A '''social panic''' is a state where a [[Social group|social]] or [[community group]] reacts negatively and in an extreme or irrational manner to unexpected or unforeseen changes in their expected social [[status quo]]. According to ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'' by [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]],  the definition can be broken down to many different sections. The sections, which were identified by [[Erich Goode]] and [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]] in 1994, include concern, hostility, consensus, disproportionality, and volatility. Concern, which is not to be mistaken with fear, is about the possible or potential threat. Hostility occurs when an outrage occurs toward the people who were a part of the problem and agencies who are accountable.&lt;ref name="Critcher Chas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Critcher|first1=Chas|title=Moral Panic Analysis: Past, Present and Future|journal=Sociology Compass|date=July 2008|volume=2|issue=4|pages=1127‚Äì1144|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2008.00122.x|url=http://www.penelopeironstone.com/Critcher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people are seen as the enemy since their behavior is viewed as a danger to society. Consensus includes a distributed agreement that an actual threat is going to take place. This is where the media and other sources come in to aid in spreading of the panic. Disproportionality compares how people react and the actual seriousness of the condition. Volatility is when there is no longer any more panic.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Stanley|title=Folk devils and moral panics the creation of the mods and the rockers|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0203828259|edition=3rd|url=https://infodocks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/stanley_cohen_folk_devils_and_moral_panics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

==Causes==
* '''Grass Root Model''' describes that social panic commonly occurs first through the people in society. The feeling that something meaningful is threatened is dispersed throughout everyone in society. This sense of panic not only displays itself through the people but also through areas such as the media and political groups. The media serves as a way to present the [[public opinion]] about the reality of the situation. This theory states that the media can't report concern where none originally exists. The media and politicians are merely an outlet for displaying what people are expressing. Furthermore, the media can affect the way the public sees situations. An example of this theory is how people cause social panics due to nuclear power. After the [[Three Mile Island accident]], where there was a [[nuclear meltdown]],  people evacuated their homes even though no workers or residents living in that area were injured or killed. The only reason people in that area were aware of what was going on was due to the social panic that people caused when they reacted to the situation. This panic was caused by the general public, not by elites or interest group as in the models explained below.&lt;ref name="Goode Erich" /&gt;
* '''The Elite-Engineered Model''' explains that social panics are exaggerated or invented problems created by elites or people who are considered higher among others in society. These type of people produce fear among the other classes over an issue that is not considered dangerous to the society. The reason for these actions is to redirect the attention away from the problems that impact the elite or those in power. The people who are considered elite could be someone who runs a company or is very rich, as they may have connections with the media and are familiar with politicians that can make proposals in their favor. An example that illustrates this theory can be seen in the Russians, specifically the Czars, who turned the focus away from the anger of poverty by spreading a Jewish conspiracy. This caused mobs to form and kill Jewish communities. This capacity of the elites to control direction allows them to accomplish their own goals. They want to continue to benefit from the economic and political inequality.&lt;ref name="Victor Jeffrey S."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victor|first1=Jeffrey S.|title=Moral Panics and the Social Construction of Deviant Behavior: A Theory and Application to the Case of Ritual Child Abuse|journal=Sociological Perspectives|date=January 1998|volume=41|issue=3|pages=541‚Äì565|doi=10.2307/1389563|url=http://pascalfroissart.free.fr/3-cache/1998-victor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Interest-Group Model''' are made by people in [[interest group]]s who direct the public's focus on actions that are intended to be morally negative and be a danger to society. They want them to recognize a problem that affects them directly. Unlike in the Elite-Engineered model, the interest groups are the ones who create social panic. Interest groups believe they are providing a [[public service]] because they will benefit from what they are doing. They do this by using the media to influence public opinion. If they are successful in doing this, it will call attention to their particular interest group, gain the trust of society and wealth, and be more advanced than opposing interest groups. An example that demonstrates this theory is when politicians, in order to get reelected, used the issue of drug abuse in the United States to cause social panic. However, even though they wanted to remain in office they still believed that drug use was a problem they wanted to address to the public.&lt;ref name="Goode Erich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goode|first1=Erich|last2=Ben-Yehuda|first2=Nachman|title=Moral panics : the social construction of deviance|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4051-8934-7|pages=52‚Äì72|edition=2nd|url=http://www.penelopeironstone.com/GOODE3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The media==
The [[News media|media]] plays a crucial part in delivering social reaction. According to [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]], there are three processes that the media expresses: Exaggeration and distortion, prediction, and symbolization.

===Exaggeration and distortion===

In this process, the media can "over-report" with their choice of words. For example, the word "disturbance" can be used to mean having a noise complaint due to loud music next door and a group of people acting violently by throwing rocks and setting vehicles on fire. The wording of the stories can make a minor problem seem more serious than it really is. This can make people overreact in response to relatively minor problems and may lead them to believe that disturbances, acts of terrorism, riots, and instances have the same meaning.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

Furthermore, the headlines used by the media might cause society to act irrationally to a story about minor issues. They can be misleading and can report information that has nothing to do with the actual story. Negative words such as "violence" can be used when there was no violence involved. The media can also point to specific characteristics that are the reason for the crime that was committed. For example, a story can discuss a murder, but the headline might focus on the hoodie the culprit was wearing. Emphasizing the hoodie will draw attention to what the person was wearing instead of the murder that took place. This causes people to become paranoid and overreact when they see someone wearing clothing that looks suspicious.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Prediction===

This is where the media speculates that an incident might occur again. The media can report that an event will occur in the future, which is not always the case. People involved describe what should be done the next time it happens and what precautions should be taken. Predicting the future can cause people to constantly think about what could go wrong and lead to catastrophe. This can cause major stress and cause people to have social panics more often.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, there are certain situations where making predictions is necessary for security, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and other [[natural disaster]]s.

===Symbolization===

This involves stereotypes, words and images that possess symbolic powers that can cause different emotions. Symbolization can be described in three processes.  It includes words such as "deviant" and, as Cohen would say, "it becomes symbolic of a certain status."&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} By this he means that the word represents something meaningful. Then the object, which can include clothing, represents the word. Therefore, the object can also symbolize the status. Neutral words can symbolize an event or emotion. For example, people can have specific feelings connected to the word "[[Hiroshima]]" that remind them of the bombing that occurred there. Furthermore, the use of labels given to a person or word puts them in a certain group in society. Those individuals that are in that group are viewed and interpreted based on their label.

Symbolization, exaggeration and distortion are similar in the sense that they both use misleading headlines that creates negative symbols. For example, images can be posed to seem more dramatic or intense than they really are. Through both of these procedures, it is easy to cause people to come to conclusions that the news and photographs always display reality.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

==Reaction==

After the events of [[9/11]], people were left in fear of crisis occurring again. According to [[Robert Wuthnow]] in his book ''Be Very Afraid'', people have responded aggressively, spending large amounts of money in fighting [[terrorism]]. The United States has spent that billions and trillions on [[national security|defense]] and [[homeland security]] respectively. However, the problem lies in how we react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wuthnow, Robert|year=2010|title=Be very afraid: the cultural response to terror, pandemics, environmental devastation, nuclear annihilation, and other threats|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=9780199730872}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

Since people have become more defensive, the focus needs to be on the correct way to act instead of an improper response. As mentioned earlier, predicting about the endless possibilities about what can happen can be just dangerous as the threat itself. People don't believe they can defend themselves from future terrorist's attacks. Individuals were constantly reminded of the concern and fear they should be experiencing by the tremendous amount of media coverage and books being published after the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name="Rothe Dawn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothe|first1=Dawn|last2=Muzzatti|first2=Stephen L.|title=Enemies Everywhere: Terrorism, Moral Panic, and US Civil Society|journal=Critical Criminology|date=November 2004|volume=12|issue=3|pages=327‚Äì350|doi=10.1007/s10612-004-3879-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event caused "personal engagement" throughout the country. In Boston, people questioned others about ties they had with [[Osama bin Laden]]. These attacks were unlike any other attacks since people experienced them firsthand whether on the news or in person. The natural response of Americans during this time was to take action‚Äîfacing the fear of terrorism, whether by taking revenge or through urging caution.

==Criticism==
[[Angela McRobbie]] and [[Sarah Thornton]] claim that Stanley Cohen's work on moral panic is outdated and argue that more modern information is required. McRobbie suggests that idea of moral panic has become so common that the media knowingly and mindfully uses it. Thornton argues that the media originally caused moral panics inadvertently; however, the media now manipulates it on its own.&lt;ref name="North Wales"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deall Trosedd :: Understanding Crime: Moral Panics|url=http://www.14-19nw.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=8651|website=www.14-19nw.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yvonne Jewkes acknowledged problems and formed concepts about moral panic. To begin with, she described the term as vague and the failure to clarify the position of the public "as media audiences or a body of opinion".&lt;ref name="Critcher Chas" /&gt; She goes on to explain that the social panics are not gladly received by the government. There is also no proof that society has an extensive social anxiety surrounding them. Jewkew, as also mentioned by McRobbie, believes that moral panic is widely used by the media. She concluded that in order for this to become a "sound conceptual basis" it needs to be revised and carefully improved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16547">'''Socio-analysis''' is the activity of exploration, consultancy, and [[action research]] which combines and synthesises methodologies and theories derived from [[psychoanalysis]], group relations, social systems thinking, [[organisational behaviour]], and social dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Bain A., ‚ÄúOn Socio-Analysis‚Äù Socio-Analysis, Vol.1 No.1 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Socio-analysis offers a conception of individuals, groups, organisations, and global systems that takes into account conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] aspects and potentialities. From this conception are born methods of exploration which can increase capacities through making conscious what was [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] for individuals, groups, and organisations, and through releasing energy and ideas that help create individual and organizational direction, and meaning.

Socio-analysis has at its heart a query as to what is the psychological truth for an individual, group, organisation, or other social system, and how may this best be brought to light as a means for creative transformation and growth?

==Socio-analysis and wonder==

[[Anxiety]], its exploration, and understanding are of central concern to [[psychoanalysis]], which was founded to explore the mental problems of medical patients. While socio-analytic exploration frequently uncovers systemic pain, (of which anxiety is a part), the ‚Äúpain‚Äù is a guide to transformation of the system as a whole with all its potentialities for growth. Joshua Bain has suggested that the emphasis on anxiety is limiting, and that a more appropriate paradigm for socio-analysis is wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Bain J., ‚ÄúFrom Anxiety to Wonder: A New Paradigm for Socio-Analysis‚Äù in Centre for Socio-Analysis Newsletter No.1, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder was regarded by [[Plato]] as the beginning of [[philosophy]], and its link to exploration, creativity, and the growth of capacities of human beings, would seem to make it the appropriate starting point for socio-analysis  as well.&lt;ref name="Bain A. 2006"&gt;Bain A., ‚ÄúSources of Authority: The Double Threads of Anxiety and Wonder‚Äù in Dare to Think the Unthought Known?, Ed.  Ajeet N. Mathur, Aivoainut Oy, Tampere, Finland. March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

‚ÄúWonder is the special affection of a philosopher; for philosophy has no other starting point than this; and it is a happy genealogy which makes Iris the daughter of [[Thaumas]]‚Äù. [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]], 155D

The saying ‚ÄúWhen wonder ceases, knowledge begins‚Äù, which is attributed to
[[Sir Francis Bacon]], is especially apt for socio-analysis with its emphasis on always explore, rather than sit tight on what is supposedly known.

==Brief history==

Socio-analysis has its roots in the first Northfield Experiment carried out by [[Wilfred Bion]] and John Rickman, and reported in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R., and Rickman, J., "Intra-group Tensions in Therapy", Lancet, 27 November 1943&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Bion in the Bulletin of the [[Menninger Clinic]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R., "The Leaderless Group Project", Bull. Meninger Clinic, 10, 3: 77 - 8l.1946&lt;/ref&gt; Bion is generally regarded as the father of socio-analysis (although the word was not used in those days).

===Wilfred Bion===

[[Wilfred Bion]] was born in [[India]] in 1897 and educated at Bishop Stortford College in [[England]]. During the [[First World War]] he commanded a tank on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and was decorated for bravery: [[Distinguished Service Order]], and the [[Legion of Honour]]. After studying [[History]] at [[Oxford University]], and a stint teaching History at his old school, he began Medical training at [[University College Hospital]] in 1924 and qualified in 1930. He worked at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London before the [[Second World War]], and started a personal psychoanalysis with John Rickman. After the Second World War he contributed to the formation of the [[Tavistock Institute]].  He had a second psycho-analysis with [[Melanie Klein]], and trained and qualified as a psychoanalyst. Bion was, and is, regarded by many people as a genius who made fundamental contributions to psychoanalysis, and to the understanding of groups. His stance of always pointing to the unknown, whether with a patient or with a group or in himself, was the realization of his genius.

===Northfield experiments===

[[Northfield Hospital]] was a military hospital, situated in [[Birmingham]], in the [[English Midlands]], with the task of treating soldiers who had developed psychiatric problems, in order to get them back into the war. Together with John Rickman, Wilfred Bion introduced group meetings as the principal method of change for these patients.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.  Bion, Rickman, Foulkes and the Northfield Experiments. London: Jessica Kingsley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, S. "‚ÄòThe dangers of this atmosphere‚Äô: a Quaker connection in the Tavistock Clinic‚Äôs  development" History of the Human Sciences 2011; '''24'''(2): 82‚Äì102&lt;/ref&gt; This Experiment, together with the Second Northfield Experiment associated with the innovations of [[S. H. Foulkes]], Tom Main and Harold Bridger, contributed the following elements to the emerging discipline of socio-analysis:
*Attention to, and making hypotheses, and interpretations, about conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] functioning at the level of the group. A group was no longer regarded as simply an aggregate of individuals, but as having its own intrinsic dynamics that required understanding and interpretation.
*The concept of working therapeutically with the ‚Äúinstitution as a whole", or the ‚Äúwhole community". The idea of the ‚Äú[[therapeutic community]]‚Äù which burgeoned after the Second World War, e.g. at the [[Menninger Clinic]] in Kansas, and the Cassel Hospital in London has its origins in Main‚Äôs work at Northfield.&lt;ref&gt;Main, T."The Concept of the Therapeutic Community: Variations and Vicissitudes", Group Analysis, 10, Suppl.1977&lt;/ref&gt;
*The significance of creating "transitional space" for therapy, action projects, and development, so that people, (in this case patients), are enabled to take up their own authority for task. Bridger pioneered this approach at Northfield through his celebrated ‚ÄúClub‚Äù, a space for patients to make of it what they wished to, without the use of the space being determined by hospital or military staff. Bridger continued to develop this approach to working with groups and organisations of all kinds after the War.

===Socio-analytic role===

The Northfield Experiments heralded a socio-analytic consultant role: one of exploration of individual, group, and organisational phenomena which are linked dynamically. The socio-analyst, as exemplified by the role Bion took at Northfield, and after the War in his group explorations at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], works from a stance of ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù with the courage, and fortitude, to pursue psychological truth.

The socio-analyst, like the psychoanalyst, uses concepts such as the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], defences, [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], [[psychological projection|projection]], [[projective identification]], [[introjection]], and [[transference]], but the field for exploration, while including the individual, is wider than the psychoanalytic dyad ‚Äì e.g. a group, an organisation, a society, global systems.

Thus, for example, the socio-analyst uses concepts of group and organisational [[transference]], and pays particular attention to the way he/she is made to feel through client engagements, as a possible indication of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dynamics within the client system.

===Group relations theory and Tavistock conferences===

Bion‚Äôs exploration of [[group dynamics]] at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London after the war culminated in a seminal publication ‚ÄúExperiences in Groups‚Äù,&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R. Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, London, Tavistock, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; which describes and analyses three basic assumptions that can be observed in group behaviour at different times: basic assumption dependency, basic assumption fight / flight, and basic assumption pairing. Basic assumptions operate unconsciously within groups at the same time a group may be engaged in a conscious work task ‚Äì that Bion called a W group.&lt;ref&gt;Two other basic assumptions have contributed to understanding group behaviour: basic assumption ‚ÄúOneness‚Äù discovered by Pierre Turquet in 1974. Turquet P, ‚ÄúLeadership: The individual and the group‚Äù in Gibbard G. et al. eds. The Large Group: Therapy and Dynamics. San Francisco and London. Jossey Bass, 1974. And basic assumption Me discovered by Gordon Lawrence and Alastair Bain in 1992. Lawrence W., Bain A.,  &amp; Gould L., ‚ÄúThe Fifth Basic Assumption.‚Äù Free Associations, London, Vol. 6, Part 1 (no. 37), 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

These insights of Bion together with theories of [[Kurt Lewin]] led to the first Group Relations Conference in 1957 that was sponsored by the [[Tavistock Institute]] of Human Relations and [[Leicester University]], and directed by [[Eric Trist]].&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E., and Sofer, C., Exploration in Group Relations, Leicester, Leicester University Press, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;
Group Relations Conferences typically explore the effects of group and organisational dynamics on how individuals take up authority and leadership in this temporary institution, and in their work. The ‚ÄúLeicester‚Äù Conference as it came to be known under the leadership of A.K.Rice and colleagues such as Pierre Turquet, Eric Miller,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Miller as director of the ''Group Relations Program'' in the [[Tavistock Institute]] since 1969 developed the design of the so called [[Nazareth-Conferences]].

===Other influences===

Other influences on the nascent discipline of socio-analysis that emerged from the work of social scientists at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in the 1950s were [[action research]];&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, E., The Changing Culture of a Factory, London, Tavistock, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery of [[socio-technical systems]]  by [[Eric Trist]] and Ken Bamforth,&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E., and Bamforth, W., "Some Social and Psychological Consequences of the Long Wall Method of Coal-Getting", Human Relations, 4.1951&lt;/ref&gt; its development by Trist and [[Fred Emery|Emery]],&lt;ref&gt;Emery F. and Trist E., "The Causal Texture of Organizational Environments", Human Relations, 18. 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Rice and Miller;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, E., and Rice, K., Systems of Organisation, London, Tavistock, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elliott Jaques]]&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, E. "Social Systems as a Defence against Persecutory and Depressive Anxiety" in Klein, M. et. a1. (eds.), New Directions in Psycho-analysis, London, Tavistock, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isabel Menzies Lyth|Isabel Menzies]]'s concept of social systems being structured as a defence against anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Menzies, 1. The Functioning of Social Systems as a Defence Against Anxiety, London, Tavistock Institute of Human Relations,1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent innovations==

===Social dreaming===

A recent methodology for the exploration of social phenomena has been the discovery of social dreaming by Gordon Lawrence at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. ‚ÄúVentures in Social Dreaming: The First Experience‚Äù in Changes, Vol. 7, No.3, July 1989
Lawrence W. ed. Social Dreaming @ Work, London, Karnac, 1998.
Lawrence W. ed. Experiences in Social Dreaming, London, Karnac, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Social Dreaming is the activity of sharing dreams (night dreams), associations to the dreams, and connections between dreams, with others in a Matrix setting. The focus of social dreaming (unlike in psychoanalysis or dreaming groups) is not on the meaning of the dream for the individual dreamer, but regarding the dreams and associations as a way of exploring and making social meaning. Conferences to explore social dreaming have been held in Israel, the United States, Australia, India, and most European countries.

Up until 1996 the work that has been described in this article went under different labels.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Psycho-analytic Social Systems Thinking, Working in the Bion I Tavistock Tradition, Psychodynamic approaches to consultancy, System Psychodynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no one word that described the activities and the role. Alastair Bain suggested that the discipline should be called ‚ÄúSocio-Analysis‚Äù in 1996.

===Organisations===

The Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis pioneered a three-year professional training program in socio-analysis in 1999, and began publishing a Journal ‚ÄúSocio-Analysis‚Äù in 1999. While the Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis no longer exists the work of socio-analysis continues to be developed by the Centre for Socio-Analysis in Melbourne [http://www.acsa.net.au]. Other organisations which do socio-analytic or closely related work include the [[William Alanson White Institute]] in New York, the [[A.K. Rice Institute]] in the United States, the [[Tavistock Institute]] and [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London, the Grubb Institute [http://www.grubb.org.uk/] and OPUS [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~opusuk/], both in London, the Centre for Applied Research in Philadelphia, the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organisations [http://www.ispso.org/], the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the University of Wuppertal [http://www.wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de/Startseite.1566.0.html], and practitioners from many countries who work in the tradition of Wilfred Bion. The Journal ‚ÄúSocio-Analysis‚Äù is now published by Group Relations Australia.[http://www.grouprelations.org.au/]

===Organisational dreaming===

Current developments in socio-analysis include Bain‚Äôs discovery of Organisational Dreaming,&lt;ref&gt;Bain A.,‚ÄúOrganisational Dreaming‚Äù, in PACAWA Newsletter, February, 2006.
Bain A. ‚ÄúThe Organisation Containing and Being Contained by Dreams: The Organisation as a Container for Dreams (1)‚Äù in Infinite Possibilities of Social Dreaming in Systems, ed. Lawrence W., Karnac, London,2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
which is based on the observation that dreams are ‚Äúcontainer sensitive‚Äù, and that the dreams shared by people within an organisation during a project will reflect organisational realities that are the ‚Äúunexpressed known‚Äù within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Organisational Dreaming is a part of the generic Social Dreaming&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority, wonder and the sangha===

The work of the Centre for Socio-Analysis has also led to a formulation of ‚Äú[[authority]]‚Äù that is based in [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]] and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] (Buddhist notion of ‚Äúpeople on the path‚Äù) in contrast to usual understandings that are based on the individual, [[anxiety]], and [[hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Bain A. 2006"/&gt;

In [[continuum mechanics]], '''stress''' is a [[physical quantity]] that expresses the internal [[force]]s that neighboring [[particle]]s of a continuous material exert on each other, while [[deformation (mechanics)#Strain|strain]] is the measure of the deformation of the material. For example, when a [[solid]] vertical bar is supporting an overhead [[weight]], each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it. When a [[liquid]] is in a closed container under [[pressure]], each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles.  The container walls and the [[pressure]]-inducing surface (such as a piston) push against them in (Newtonian) [[reaction force|reaction]]. These macroscopic forces are actually the net result of a very large number of [[intermolecular force]]s and [[statistical mechanics|collision]]s between the particles in those [[molecule]]s. Stress is frequently represented by a lowercase Greek letter sigma (œÉ).

Strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms, such as ''stress'' as applied by external forces to the bulk material (like [[gravity]]) or to its surface (like [[contact force]]s, external pressure, or [[friction]]).  Any [[deformation (mechanics)|strain (deformation)]] of a solid material generates an internal ''elastic stress'', analogous to the reaction force of a [[spring (device)|spring]], that tends to restore the material to its original non-deformed state.  In liquids and [[gas]]es, only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress. However, if the deformation is gradually changing with time, even in fluids there will usually be some  ''viscous stress'', opposing that change.  Elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name ''mechanical stress''.
[[File:DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRESS.png|thumb|Mechanic stress]]

Significant stress may exist even when deformation is negligible or non-existent (a common assumption when modeling the flow of water). Stress may exist in the absence of external forces; such ''built-in stress'' is important, for example, in [[prestressed concrete]] and [[tempered glass]]. Stress may also be imposed on a material without the application of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|net forces]], for example by [[thermal expansion|changes in temperature]] or [[chemistry|chemical]] composition, or by external [[electromagnetic field]]s (as in [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] and [[magnetostriction|magnetostrictive]] materials).

The relation between mechanical stress, deformation, and the [[strain rate tensor|rate of change of deformation]] can be quite complicated, although a [[linear elasticity|linear approximation]] may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough. Stress that exceeds certain [[strength of materials|strength limits]] of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as [[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[cavitation]]) or even change its [[crystal structure]]  and [[chemistry|chemical composition]].

In some branches of [[engineering]], the term ''stress'' is occasionally used in a looser sense as a synonym of "internal force". For example, in the analysis of [[truss]]es, it may refer to the total traction or compression force acting on a beam, rather than the force divided by the area of its [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]].

==History==
[[File:Roman era stone arch bridge, Ticino, Switzerland cropped.JPG|right|thumb|[[Roman Empire|Roman]]-era bridge in [[Switzerland]]]]

&lt;!--[[File:Pantheon-Kuppel von innen.JPG|right|thumb|Cupola of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Rome]]]]--&gt;
Since ancient times humans have been consciously aware of stress inside materials. Until the 17th century, the understanding of stress was largely intuitive and empirical; and yet it resulted in some surprisingly sophisticated technology, like the [[composite bow]] and [[glass blowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=J.E.|title=Structures, or, Why things don't fall down|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0306812835|edition=2. Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over several millennia, architects and builders, in particular, learned how to put together carefully shaped wood beams and stone blocks to withstand, transmit, and distribute stress in the most effective manner, with ingenious devices such as the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]], [[arch]]es, [[cupola]]s, [[truss]]es and the [[flying buttress]]es of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]].

Ancient and medieval architects did develop some geometrical methods and simple formulas to compute the proper sizes of pillars and beams, but the scientific understanding of stress became possible only after the necessary tools were invented in the 17th and 18th centuries: [[Galileo Galilei]]'s rigorous [[experimental method]], [[Ren√© Descartes]]'s [[Cartesian coordinates|coordinates]] and [[analytic geometry]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws|laws of motion and equilibrium]] and [[calculus|calculus of infinitesimals]].&lt;ref name="Lubliner" /&gt;  With those tools, [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] was able to give the first rigorous and general mathematical model for stress in a homogeneous medium.{{citation needed|date = June 2014}}  Cauchy observed that the force across an imaginary surface was a linear function of its normal vector; and, moreover, that it must be a symmetric function (with zero total momentum).{{citation needed|date = June 2014}}

The understanding of stress in liquids started with Newton, who provided a differential formula for friction forces (shear stress) in parallel [[laminar flow]].

==Overview==

=== Definition ===
Stress is defined as the force across a "small" boundary per unit area of that boundary, for all orientations of the boundary.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; Being derived from a fundamental physical quantity (force) and a purely geometrical quantity (area), stress is also a fundamental quantity, like velocity, [[torque]] or [[energy]], that can be quantified and analyzed without explicit consideration of the nature of the material or of its physical causes.

Following the basic premises of continuum mechanics, stress is a [[macroscopic]] concept.  Namely, the particles considered in its definition and analysis should be just small enough to be treated as homogeneous in composition and state, but still large enough to ignore [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and the detailed motions of molecules.  Thus, the force between two particles is actually the average of a very large number of atomic forces between their molecules; and physical quantities like mass, velocity, and forces that act through the bulk of three-dimensional bodies, like gravity, are assumed to be smoothly distributed over them.&lt;ref name="Chadwick" /&gt;{{rp|p.90‚Äì106}} Depending on the context, one may also assume that the particles are large enough to allow the averaging out of other microscopic features, like the grains of a [[metal]] rod or the [[fiber]]s of a piece of [[wood]].

[[File:Cmec stress defn f02 t6.png|thumb|200px|right|The stress across a surface element (yellow disk) is the force that the material on one side (top ball) exerts on the material on the other side (bottom ball), divided by the area of the surface.]]
Quantitatively, the stress is expressed by the ''Cauchy traction vector'' ''T'' defined as the traction force ''F'' between adjacent parts of the material across an imaginary separating surface ''S'', divided by the area of ''S''.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;{{rp|p.41‚Äì50}} In a [[fluid]] at rest the force is perpendicular to the surface, and is the familiar [[hydrostatic pressure|pressure]].  In a [[solid]], or in a [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of viscous [[liquid]], the force ''F'' may not be perpendicular to ''S''; hence the stress across a surface must be regarded a vector quantity, not a scalar. Moreover, the direction and magnitude generally depend on the orientation of ''S''.  Thus the stress state of the material must be described by a [[tensor]], called the [[Cauchy stress tensor|(Cauchy) stress tensor]]; which is a [[linear map|linear function]] that relates the [[surface normal|normal vector]] ''n'' of a surface ''S'' to the stress ''T'' across ''S''.  With respect to any chosen [[Cartesian coordinates|coordinate system]], the Cauchy stress tensor can be represented as a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of 3√ó3 real numbers. Even within a [[homogeneous]] body, the stress tensor may vary from place to place, and may change over time; therefore, the stress within a material is, in general, a time-varying [[tensor field]].

=== Normal and shear stress ===
{{Further information|compression (physical)|Shear stress}}

In general, the stress ''T'' that a particle ''P'' applies on another particle ''Q'' across a surface ''S'' can have any direction relative to ''S''.  The vector ''T'' may be regarded as the sum of two components: the ''normal stress'' ([[Compression (physical)|compression]] or [[Tension (physics)|tension]]) perpendicular to the surface, and the ''[[shear stress]]'' that is parallel to the surface.

If the normal unit vector ''n'' of the surface (pointing from ''Q'' towards ''P'') is assumed fixed, the normal component can be expressed by a single number, the [[inner product|dot product]] {{nowrap|''T'' ¬∑ ''n''}}.  This number will be positive if ''P'' is "pulling" on ''Q'' (tensile stress), and negative if ''P'' is "pushing" against ''Q'' (compressive stress) The shear component is then the vector {{nowrap|''T'' ‚àí (''T'' ¬∑ ''n'')''n''}}.

=== Units ===
The dimension of stress is that of [[pressure]], and therefore its coordinates are commonly measured in the same units as pressure: namely, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]]s (Pa, that is, [[newton (force)|newton]]s per [[square metre]]) in the [[International System of Units|International System]], or [[pound-force|pounds]] per [[square inch]] (psi) in the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]]. Because mechanical stresses easily exceed a million Pascals, MPa, which stands for megapascal, is a common unit of stress.

=== Causes and effects ===
[[File:Vase-craquele-Emile-Galle-vers-1880-decor-mante-religieuse-cigale-1301.jpg|upright|thumb|Glass vase with the ''[[craquel√©]]'' effect. The cracks are the result of brief but intense stress created when the semi-molten piece is briefly dipped in water.&lt;ref name=lamglass/&gt;]]
Stress in a material body may be due to multiple physical causes, including external influences and internal physical processes. Some of these agents (like gravity, changes in [[temperature]] and [[phase (chemistry)|phase]], and electromagnetic fields) act on the bulk of the material, varying continuously with position and time.  Other agents (like external loads and friction, ambient pressure, and contact forces) may create stresses and forces that are concentrated on certain surfaces, lines, or points; and possibly also on very short time intervals (as in the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s due to collisions). In general, the stress distribution in the body is expressed as a [[piecewise]] [[continuous function]] of space and time.

Conversely, stress is usually correlated with various effects on the material, possibly including changes in physical properties like [[birefringence]], [[polarizability|polarization]], and [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]. The imposition of stress by an external agent usually creates some [[deformation (mechanics)|strain (deformation)]] in the material, even if it is too small to be detected. In a solid material, such strain will in turn generate an internal elastic stress, analogous to the reaction force of a stretched [[spring (device)|spring]], tending to restore the material to its original undeformed state. Fluid materials (liquids, [[gas]]es and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s) by definition can only oppose deformations that would change their volume. However, if the deformation is changing with time, even in fluids there will usually be some viscous stress, opposing that change.

The relation between stress and its effects and causes, including deformation and rate of change of deformation, can be quite complicated (although a [[linear elasticity|linear approximation]] may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough). Stress that exceeds certain [[strength of materials|strength limits]] of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as [[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[cavitation]]) or even change its [[crystal structure]]  and [[chemistry|chemical composition]].

==Simple stress==

In some situations, the stress within a body may adequately be described by a single number, or by a single vector (a number and a direction). Three such '''simple stress''' situations, that are often encountered in engineering design, are the ''uniaxial normal stress'', the ''simple shear stress'', and the ''isotropic normal stress''.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;

===Uniaxial normal stress===
[[File:Axial stress noavg.svg|240px|thumb|right|Idealized stress in a straight bar with uniform cross-section.]]
A common situation with a simple stress pattern is when a straight rod, with uniform material and cross section, is subjected to [[tension (physics)|tension]] by opposite forces of magnitude &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; along its axis. If the system is in [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and not changing with time, and the weight of the bar can be neglected, then through each transversal section of the bar the top part must pull on the bottom part with the same force, ''F'' with continuity through the full cross-sectional area'', A''. Therefore, the stress, œÉ throughout the bar, across any horizontal surface, can be expressed simply by the singly number œÉ, calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, ''F'' and cross sectional area, ''A''.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sigma=\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt; On the other hand, if one imagines the bar being cut along its length, parallel to the axis, there will be no force (hence no stress) between the two halves across the cut.

This type of stress may be called (simple) normal stress or uniaxial stress; specifically, (uniaxial, simple, etc.) tensile stress.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;  If the load is [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the bar, rather than stretching it, the analysis is the same except that the force ''F'' and the stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; change sign, and the stress is called compressive stress.

[[File:Normal stress.svg|240px|thumb|left|The ratio &lt;math&gt;\sigma = F/A&lt;/math&gt; may be only an average stress. The stress may be unevenly distributed over the cross section (''m''‚Äì''m''), especially near the attachment points (''n''‚Äì''n'').]]
This analysis assumes the stress is evenly distributed over the entire cross-section. In practice, depending on how the bar is attached at the ends and how it was manufactured, this assumption may not be valid. In that case, the value &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = ''F''/''A'' will be only the average stress, called ''engineering stress'' or ''nominal stress''. However, if the bar's length ''L'' is many times its diameter ''D'', and it has no gross defects or [[built-in stress]], then the stress can be assumed to be uniformly distributed over any cross-section that is more than a few times ''D'' from both ends. (This observation is known as the [[Saint-Venant's principle]]).

Normal stress occurs in many other situations besides axial tension and compression. If an elastic bar with uniform and symmetric cross-section is bent in one of its planes of symmetry, the resulting ''bending stress'' will still be normal (perpendicular to the cross-section), but will vary over the cross section: the outer part will be under tensile stress, while the inner part will be compressed. Another variant of normal stress is the ''hoop stress'' that occurs on the walls of a cylindrical [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]  or [[pressure vessel|vessel]] filled with pressurized fluid.

===Simple shear stress===

[[File:Shear stress.svg|240px|right|thumb|Shear stress in a horizontal bar loaded by two offset blocks.]]
Another simple type of stress occurs when a uniformly thick layer of elastic material like glue or rubber is firmly attached to two stiff bodies that are pulled in opposite directions by forces parallel to the layer; or a section of a soft metal bar that is being cut by the jaws of a [[snips|scissors-like tool]]. Let ''F'' be the magnitude of those forces, and ''M'' be the midplane of that layer. Just as in the normal stress case, the part of the layer on one side of ''M'' must pull the other part with the same force ''F''. Assuming that the direction of the forces is known, the stress across ''M'' can be expressed simply by the single number &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; , calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, ''F'' and the cross sectional area, ''A''.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\tau=\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;However, unlike normal stress, this ''simple shear stress'' is directed parallel to the cross-section considered, rather than perpendicular to it.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;  For any plane ''S'' that is perpendicular to the layer, the net internal force across ''S'', and hence the stress, will be zero.

As in the case of an axially loaded bar, in practice the shear stress may not be uniformly distributed over the layer; so, as before, the ratio ''F''/''A'' will only be an average ("nominal", "engineering") stress. However, that average is often sufficient for practical purposes.&lt;ref name="Pilkey" /&gt;{{rp|p.292}} Shear stress is observed also when a cylindrical bar such as a [[axle|shaft]] is subjected to opposite torques at its ends. In that case, the shear stress on each cross-section is parallel to the cross-section, but oriented tangentially relative to the axis, and increases with distance from the axis. Significant shear stress occurs in the middle plate (the "web") of [[I-beam]]s under bending loads, due to the web constraining the end plates ("flanges").

=== Isotropic stress ===
[[File:Isotropic stress noavg.svg|240px|right|thumb|Isotropic tensile stress. Top left: Each face of a cube of homogeneous material is pulled by a force with magnitude ''F'', applied evenly over the entire face whose area is ''A''.  The force across any section ''S'' of the cube must balance the forces applied below the section. In the three sections shown, the forces are ''F'' (top right), ''F''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (bottom left), and ''F''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}/2&lt;/math&gt; (bottom right); and the area of ''S'' is ''A'', ''A''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}/2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. So the stress across ''S'' is ''F''/''A'' in all three cases.]]
Another simple type of stress occurs when the material body is under equal compression or tension in all directions.  This is the case, for example, in a portion of liquid or gas at rest, whether enclosed in some container or as part of a larger mass of fluid; or inside a cube of elastic material that is being pressed or pulled on all six faces by equal perpendicular forces ‚Äî provided, in both cases, that the material is homogeneous, without built-in stress, and that the effect of gravity and other external forces can be neglected.

In these situations, the stress across any imaginary internal surface turns out to be equal in magnitude and always directed perpendicularly to the surface independently of the surface's orientation. This type of stress may be called ''isotropic normal'' or just ''isotropic''; if it is compressive, it is called ''hydrostatic pressure'' or just ''pressure''. Gases by definition cannot withstand tensile stresses, but some liquids may withstand surprisingly large amounts of isotropic tensile stress under some circumstances. see [[Z-tube]].

=== Cylinder stresses ===
Parts with [[rotational symmetry]], such as wheels, axles, pipes, and pillars, are very common in engineering. Often the stress patterns that occur in such parts have rotational or even [[cylindrical symmetry]]. The analysis of such [[cylinder stress]]es can take advantage of the symmetry to reduce the dimension of the domain and/or of the stress tensor.

== General stress ==
Often, mechanical bodies experience more than one type of stress at the same time; this is called ''combined stress''. In normal and shear stress, the magnitude of the stress is maximum for surfaces that are perpendicular to a certain direction &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and zero across any surfaces that are parallel to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. When the shear stress is zero only across surfaces that are perpendicular to one particular direction, the stress is called ''biaxial'', and can be viewed as the sum of two normal or shear stresses. In the most general case, called ''triaxial stress'', the stress is nonzero across every surface element.

=== The Cauchy stress tensor{{anchor|Cauchy stress tensor}} ===
{{Main article|Cauchy stress tensor}}
[[File:Components stress tensor cartesian.svg|270px|left|thumb|Components of stress in three dimensions]]
[[File:Cmec stress ball f02 t6.png|thumb|240px|right|Illustration of typical stresses (arrows) across various surface elements on the boundary of a particle (sphere), in a homogeneous material under uniform (but not isotropic) triaxial stress. The normal stresses on the principal axes are +5, +2, and ‚àí3 units.]]
Combined stresses cannot be described by a single vector. Even if the material is stressed in the same way throughout the volume of the body, the stress across any imaginary surface will depend on the orientation of that surface, in a non-trivial way.

However, Cauchy observed that the stress vector &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; across a surface will always be a [[linear function]] of the surface's [[surface normal|normal vector]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the unit-length vector that is perpendicular to it.  That is, &lt;math&gt;T = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where the function &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\alpha u + \beta v) = \alpha\boldsymbol{\sigma}(u) + \beta\boldsymbol{\sigma}(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for any vectors &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; and any real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
The function &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, now called the [[Cauchy stress tensor|(Cauchy) stress tensor]], completely describes the stress state of a uniformly stressed body. (Today, any linear connection between two physical vector quantities is called a [[tensor]], reflecting Cauchy's original use to describe the "tensions" (stresses) in a material.) In [[tensor calculus]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is classified as second-order tensor of [[type of a tensor|type (0,2)]].

Like any linear map between vectors, the stress tensor can be represented in any chosen [[Cartesian coordinate system]] by a 3√ó3 matrix of real numbers. Depending on whether the coordinates are numbered &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3&lt;/math&gt; or named &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma _{11} &amp; \sigma _{12} &amp; \sigma _{13} \\
    \sigma _{21} &amp; \sigma _{22} &amp; \sigma _{23} \\
    \sigma _{31} &amp; \sigma _{32} &amp; \sigma _{33} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \quad\quad\quad
&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;
  \quad\quad\quad
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma _{xx} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
    \sigma _{yx} &amp; \sigma _{yy} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
    \sigma _{zx} &amp; \sigma _{zy} &amp; \sigma _{zz} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The stress vector &lt;math&gt;T = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(n)&lt;/math&gt; across a surface with [[normal vector]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with coordinates &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2,n_3&lt;/math&gt; is then a matrix product &lt;math&gt;T = n\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}^T\cdot n^T&lt;/math&gt; (where T in upper index is transposition) (look on [[Cauchy stress tensor]]), that is
:&lt;math&gt; 
  \begin{bmatrix} T_1\\T_2 \\ T_3 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{31} \\
    \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{32} \\
    \sigma_{13} &amp; \sigma_{23} &amp; \sigma_{33} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} n_1\\n_2 \\ n_3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The linear relation between &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; follows from the fundamental laws of [[conservation of linear momentum]] and [[static equilibrium]] of forces, and is therefore mathematically exact, for any material and any stress situation. The components of the Cauchy stress tensor at every point in a material satisfy the equilibrium equations ([[Cauchy momentum equation|Cauchy‚Äôs equations of motion]] for zero acceleration). Moreover, the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]] implies that the stress tensor is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], that is &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{13} = \sigma_{31}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the stress state of the medium at any point and instant can be specified by only six independent parameters, rather than nine.  These may be written
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_x &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz} \\
    \tau_{xy} &amp; \sigma_y &amp; \tau_{yz} \\
    \tau_{xz} &amp; \tau_{yz} &amp; \sigma_z
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the elements &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''orthogonal normal stresses'' (relative to the chosen coordinate system), and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}, \tau_{xz},\tau_{yz}&lt;/math&gt; the ''orthogonal shear stresses''.

===Change of coordinates===

The Cauchy stress tensor obeys the tensor transformation law under a change in the system of coordinates. A graphical representation of this transformation law is the [[Mohr's circle]] of stress distribution.

As a symmetric 3√ó3 real matrix, the stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; has three mutually orthogonal unit-length [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]]s &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt; and three real [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma} e_i = \lambda_i e_i&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, in a coordinate system with axes &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt;, the stress tensor is a diagonal matrix, and has only the three normal components &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; the [[principal stresses]]. If the three eigenvalues are equal, the stress is an [[isotropic]] compression or tension, always perpendicular to any surface, there is no shear stress, and the tensor is a diagonal matrix in any coordinate frame.

===Stress as a tensor field===
In general, stress is not uniformly distributed over a material body, and may vary with time. Therefore, the stress tensor must be defined for each point and each moment, by considering an [[infinitesimal]] particle of the medium surrounding that point, and taking the average stresses in that particle as being the stresses at the point.

=== Stress in thin plates ===
[[File:W39504 stat Nbk2007.jpg|240px|thumb|right|A [[tank car]] made from bent and welded steel plates.]]
Man-made objects are often made from stock plates of various materials by operations that do not change their essentially two-dimensional character, like cutting, drilling, gentle bending and welding along the edges. The description of stress in such bodies can be simplified by modeling those parts as two-dimensional surfaces rather than three-dimensional bodies.

In that view, one redefines a "particle" as being an infinitesimal patch of the plate's surface, so that the boundary between adjacent particles becomes an infinitesimal line element; both are implicitly extended in the third dimension, normal to (straight through) the plate. "Stress" is then redefined as being a measure of the internal forces between two adjacent "particles" across their common line element, divided by the length of that line. Some components of the stress tensor can be ignored, but since particles are not infinitesimal in the third dimension one can no longer ignore the torque that a particle applies on its neighbors. That torque is modeled as a ''bending stress'' that tends to change the [[curvature]] of the plate. However, these simplifications may not hold at welds, at sharp bends and creases (where the [[radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] is comparable to the thickness of the plate).

=== Stress in thin beams ===
[[File:Sandy Hook NJ beach fisherman's pole.jpg|120px|thumb|right|For stress modeling, a [[fishing pole]] may be considered one-dimensional.]]
The analysis of stress can be considerably simplified also for thin bars, [[beam (engineering)|beam]]s or wires of uniform (or smoothly varying) composition and cross-section that are subjected to moderate bending and twisting. For those bodies, one may consider only cross-sections that are perpendicular to the bar's axis, and redefine a "particle" as being a piece of wire with infinitesimal length between two such cross sections. The ordinary stress is then reduced to a scalar (tension or compression of the bar), but one must take into account also a ''bending stress'' (that tries to change the bar's curvature, in some direction perpendicular to the axis) and a ''torsional stress'' (that tries to twist or un-twist it about its axis).

===Other descriptions of stress===
The Cauchy stress tensor is used for stress analysis of material bodies experiencing [[Infinitesimal strain theory|small deformations]] where the differences in stress distribution in most cases can be neglected. For large deformations, also called [[Finite strain theory|finite deformations]], other measures of stress, such as the [[Piola‚ÄìKirchoff stress tensor|first and second Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensors]], the [[Stress measures|Biot stress tensor]], and the [[Stress measures|Kirchhoff stress tensor]], are required.

Solids, liquids, and gases have [[stress field]]s. Static fluids support normal stress but will flow under [[shear stress]]. Moving [[viscosity|viscous fluids]] can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with [[ductile]] materials failing under shear and [[brittle]] materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]] materials have rate-dependent variations.

== Stress analysis ==
[[Stress analysis]] is a branch of [[applied physics]] that covers the determination of the internal distribution of internal forces in solid objects. It is an essential tool in [[engineering]] for the study and design of structures such as [[tunnel]]s, [[dam]]s, mechanical parts, and structural frames, under prescribed or expected loads.  It is also important in many other disciplines; for example, in [[geology]], to study phenomena like [[plate tectonics]], [[volcano|vulcanism]] and [[avalanche]]s; and in [[biology]], to understand the [[anatomy]] of living beings.

=== Goals and assumptions ===
Stress analysis is generally concerned with objects and structures that can be assumed to be in macroscopic [[static equilibrium]]. By [[Newton's laws of motion]], any external forces are being applied to such a system must be balanced by internal reaction forces,&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|p.97}} which are almost always surface contact forces between adjacent particles ‚Äî that is, as stress.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; Since every particle needs to be in equilibrium, this reaction stress will generally propagate from particle, creating a stress distribution throughout the body.

The typical problem in stress analysis is to determine these internal stresses, given the external forces that are acting on the system. The latter may be [[body force]]s (such as gravity or magnetic attraction), that act throughout the volume of a material;&lt;ref name="Irgens" /&gt;{{rp|p.42‚Äì81}} or concentrated loads (such as friction between an axle and a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], or the weight of a train wheel on a rail), that are imagined to act over a two-dimensional area, or along a line, or at single point.

In stress analysis one normally disregards the physical causes of the forces or the precise nature of the materials.  Instead, one assumes that the stresses are related to deformation (and, in non-static problems, to the rate of deformation) of the material by known [[constitutive equations]].&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
Stress analysis may be carried out experimentally, by applying loads to the actual artifact or to scale model, and measuring the resulting stresses, by any of several available methods. This approach is often used for safety certification and monitoring. However, most stress analysis is done by mathematical methods, especially during design.

The basic stress analysis problem can be formulated by [[Euler's laws|Euler's equations of motion]] for continuous bodies (which are consequences of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] for conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]) and the [[Euler-Cauchy stress principle]], together with the appropriate constitutive equations. Thus one obtains a system of [[partial differential equations]] involving the stress tensor field and the [[strain tensor]] field, as unknown functions to be determined. The external body forces appear as the independent ("right-hand side") term in the differential equations, while the concentrated forces appear as boundary conditions.  The basic stress analysis problem is therefore a [[boundary-value problem]].

Stress analysis for [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] structures is based on the [[theory of elasticity]] and [[infinitesimal strain theory]]. When the applied loads cause permanent deformation, one must use more complicated constitutive equations, that can account for the physical processes involved ([[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[phase transition|phase change]], etc.).

However, engineered structures are usually designed so that the maximum expected stresses are well within the range of [[linear elasticity]] (the generalization of [[Hooke‚Äôs law]] for continuous media); that is, the deformations caused by internal stresses are linearly related to them. In this case the differential equations that define the stress tensor are linear, and the problem becomes much easier. For one thing, the stress at any point will be a linear function of the loads, too. For small enough stresses, even non-linear systems can usually be assumed to be linear.

[[File:Loaded truss.svg|240px|right|thumb|Simplified model of a truss for stress analysis, assuming unidimensional elements under uniform axial tension or compression.]]
Stress analysis is simplified when the physical dimensions and the distribution of loads allow the structure to be treated as one- or two-dimensional. In the analysis of trusses, for example, the stress field may be assumed to be uniform and uniaxial over each member. Then the differential equations reduce to a finite set of equations (usually linear) with finitely many unknowns.
In other contexts one may be able to reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one, and/or replace the general stress and strain tensors by simpler models like uniaxial tension/compression, simple shear, etc.

Still, for two- or three-dimensional cases one must solve a partial differential equation problem.
Analytical or closed-form solutions to the differential equations can be obtained when the geometry,  constitutive relations, and boundary conditions are simple enough. Otherwise one must generally resort to numerical approximations such as the [[finite element method]], the [[finite difference method]], and the [[boundary element method]].

==Alternative measures of stress==
{{Main article|Stress measures}}
Other useful stress measures include the first and second [[Stress measures|Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensors]], the [[Stress measures#Biot stress|Biot stress tensor]], and the [[Stress measures#Kirchhoff stress|Kirchhoff stress tensor]].

===Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor===
In the case of [[finite deformation tensor|finite deformations]], the ''Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensors'' express the stress relative to the reference configuration. This is in contrast to the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] which expresses the stress relative to the present configuration. For infinitesimal deformations and rotations, the Cauchy and Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff tensors are identical.

Whereas the Cauchy stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; relates stresses in the current configuration, the deformation [[gradient]] and strain tensors are described by relating the motion to the reference configuration; thus not all tensors describing the state of the material are in either the reference or current configuration. Describing the stress, strain and deformation either in the reference or current configuration would make it easier to define constitutive models (for example, the Cauchy Stress tensor is variant to a pure rotation, while the deformation strain tensor is invariant; thus creating problems in defining a constitutive model that relates a varying tensor, in terms of an invariant one during pure rotation; as by definition constitutive models have to be invariant to pure rotations). The 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; is one possible solution to this problem. It defines a family of tensors, which describe the configuration of the body in either the current or the reference state.

The 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; relates forces in the ''present'' configuration with areas in the ''reference'' ("material") configuration.
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{P} = J~\boldsymbol{\sigma}~\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} ~&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deformation gradient]] and &lt;math&gt;J= \det\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] [[determinant]].

In terms of components with respect to an [[orthonormal basis]], the first Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_{iL} = J~\sigma_{ik}~F^{-1}_{Lk} = J~\sigma_{ik}~\cfrac{\partial X_L}{\partial x_k}~\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Because it relates different coordinate systems, the 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress is a [[two-point tensor]]. In general, it is not symmetric. The 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress is the 3D generalization of the 1D concept of [[engineering stress]].

If the material rotates without a change in stress state (rigid rotation), the components of the 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor will vary with material orientation.

The 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress is energy conjugate to the deformation gradient.

====2nd Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor====
Whereas the 1st Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress relates forces in the current configuration to areas in the reference configuration, the 2nd Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt; relates forces in the reference configuration to areas in the reference configuration. The force in the reference configuration is obtained via a mapping that preserves the relative relationship between the force direction and the area normal in the reference configuration.
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{S} = J~\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[index notation]] with respect to an orthonormal basis,
:&lt;math&gt;S_{IL}=J~F^{-1}_{Ik}~F^{-1}_{Lm}~\sigma_{km} = J~\cfrac{\partial X_I}{\partial x_k}~\cfrac{\partial X_L}{\partial x_m}~\sigma_{km} \!\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This tensor, a one-point tensor, is symmetric.

If the material rotates without a change in stress state (rigid rotation), the components of the 2nd Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor remain constant, irrespective of material orientation.

The 2nd Piola‚ÄìKirchhoff stress tensor is energy conjugate to the [[Finite deformation tensor|Green‚ÄìLagrange finite strain tensor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11497">In [[United States|American]] [[jurisprudence]], a '''suspect classification''' is any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] claim alleging [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.

== Federal classifications ==
[[Strict scrutiny]] is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a "suspect classification." The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.&lt;ref name="Wintemute"&gt;Wintemute, Robert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFhzZiPF2YC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22criteria+for+identifying+suspect+classifications%22&amp;ei=rbVkS72tA5X6Ndm15dcN&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22criteria%20for%20identifying%20suspect%20classifications%22&amp;f=false Sexual Orientation and Human Rights]'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the criteria that have been cited include:
* The group has historically been discriminated against or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Wintemute" /&gt;
* They possess an [[wikt:immutable|immutable]]&lt;ref name="Lyng"&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=477&amp;invol=635 Lyng v. Castillo]'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or highly visible trait.
* They are powerless&lt;ref name="Lyng" /&gt; to protect themselves via the political process. (The group is a "discrete" and "insular" minority.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[US v. Carolene Products Co.#Text of Footnote Four|U.S. v. Carolene Products]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]] 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspect class ===
The Supreme Court  established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 320 U.S. 81 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Hirabayashi v. United States |vol=320 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 81|court= United States Supreme Court=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', 323 U.S. 214 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Korematsu v. United States|vol=323 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 214|court= United States Supreme Court=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court recognizes [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[national origin]], [[religion]] and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under [[strict scrutiny]].

In ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in its Findings of Fact commented  that [[sexual orientation]] could be considered a suspect class but, on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Perry v. Schwarzenegger|vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint=122 |court=United States District Court for the Northern District of California|date=2010-08-05|url=http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2010/08/04/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL.pdf|quote= The trial record shows that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review to apply to legislative classifications based on sexual orientation. All classifications based on sexual orientation appear suspect, as the evidence shows that California would rarely, if ever, have a reason to categorize individuals based on their sexual orientation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska]] held the same in ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 368 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D.Neb. 2005)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235759/http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was reversed on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213233153/http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf |date=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such. 

==== Alienage ====
[[Alienage]], or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of [[U.S. state|state]] law, [[alien (law)|legal aliens]] are a suspect class (''[[Graham v. Richardson]]'', 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the [[United States Congress]] has the power to regulate [[immigration]], [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive [[rational basis scrutiny]]. State acts that affect [[alien (law)|unlawful immigrants]] are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', 457 U.S. 202 (1982).

=== Quasi-suspect class ===
[[Intermediate scrutiny]] is applied to groups that fall under a "quasi-suspect classification." Gender&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan|Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan]]'', 458 U.S. 718 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy of birth]] have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for 
Northern California]] discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management'', C 10-00257 (N.D. Cal. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Striking down Section 3 of [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] as unconstitutional in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'' (2012), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit Court of Appeals]] held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1afe4f62-fbf9-4e0d-a409-26ab7396971e/1/doc/12-2335_complete_opn.pdf ''Windsor v. United States''], 12-2335-cv(L), October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=David|title=The End of an Unjust Law: The Second Circuit Strikes Down DOMA and Sets the Stage for Supreme Court Review|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/22/the-end-of-an-unjust-law|publisher=Justia|date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court however has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class.

=== All others ===

[[Rational basis review|Rational basis scrutiny]] is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria‚Äî''e.g.'', [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.

== Levels of judicial review ==

=== Strict scrutiny ===
To satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest.

The practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], skin [[color]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], or [[Nationality|national]] origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with [[national security]], defense, or [[affirmative action]]. ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', regarding Japanese internment, and ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test.

Strict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any [[fundamental right]], regardless of the group involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Souter, David|first=US Supreme Court Justice|title=Vacco v. Quill - 521 U.S. 793 (1997)|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/793/case|work=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate scrutiny ===
When [[intermediate scrutiny]] is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes. [[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]], 102 S.Ct. 3331 (1982), [[Nguyen v. INS]], 121 S.Ct. 2053 (2001).

=== Rational basis ===
When [[rational basis review]] is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.

== Classifications under state law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] holdings impose a minimum standard to which each [[U.S. state|State]] must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the [[Supreme Court of California]] used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a [[California]] statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages.

[[California]] classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. [[Connecticut]] and [[Iowa]] classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Chuck, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IwNhIK9Fn1sC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+and+suspect+class&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qvlLLVJ3VE&amp;sig=LpvcmKqGjXX4N4YyC-YdTxy4GwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OmZmSqLcEJGKMpDG7aEB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Homosexuality and the Law: A Dictionary]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable design''' (also called environmentally sustainable design,  environmentally conscious design, etc.) is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of [[ecology|ecological]] [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"&gt;McLennan, J. F. (2004), The Philosophy of Sustainable Design&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit}}  Note: Social and economic factors are vitally important considerations, but are sub systems in the larger context of the Earth's eco-sphere. 

==Theory==
The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design".&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"/&gt; Manifestations of sustainable design require [[renewable resources]], impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment.

Great design is sustainable design: Rather than considering green building design as an externality, architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design. This includes better user experience and comfort, doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance, and maximizing the effectives of durable, quality materials. Rather than the well-known edict ‚Äúform follows function,‚Äù it‚Äôs time to think ‚Äúform follows environment.‚Äù &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.edgebuildings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/igen-2016-prashant-kapoor-red.pdf|title=  Architect and Interiors India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. A dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://engagebydesign.org/values/|title=  Sustainable Design Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual problems===

====Diminishing returns====
The principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the [[technology life cycle]] and in the useful life of any system as discussed in [[industrial ecology]] and [[life cycle assessment]].  Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits.  Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity, the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} (see also: [[law of diminishing returns]], [[marginal utility]] and [[Jevons paradox]].)

====Unsustainable investment====
A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], but may lead to a collapse.  This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by [[Joseph Tainter]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;JA Tainter 1988 The Collapse of Complex Societies Cambridge Univ. Press {{ISBN|978-0521386739}}&lt;/ref&gt; This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mayan Empire|Mayan]], among others. Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forest.mtu.edu/info/ecologyseries/Hollings%201973%20resilience.pdf Buzz Holling 1973 Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste prevention====
[[File:Floriade2012Design-GreenestBuildingNL.pdf|thumb|Plans for Floriade 2012 in Venlo, the Netherlands: "The Greenest Building in the Netherlands - no external fuel, electricity, water or sewage."]]
'''Negative Effects of Waste'''

About 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U.K. alone, for example, each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/waste/ Waste and recycling], DEFRA&lt;/ref&gt; And with reference to only household waste, between 1991/92 and 2007/08, each person in England generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1769 Household waste], Office for National Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal. All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment, public health, and local economies. Landfills have contaminated drinking water. Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air, soil, and water. The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology. Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts.

The toxics components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem. In the U.S., about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials, such as [[heavy metals]] like [[nickel]], [[lead]], [[cadmium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from batteries, and [[organic compounds]] found in pesticides and consumer products, such as [[air freshener]] sprays, [[nail polish]], cleaners, and other products.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, "[http://www.epa.gov/ncct/expocast/ Expocast]"&lt;/ref&gt; When burned or buried, toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment.

The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation. Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem. It does not mean doing without, but doing differently. For example, preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages; it just means using refillable bottles.

'''Waste prevention strategies'''
In planning for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste. A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through [[biodegradation]]. This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment. 

Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste &amp;mdash; materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors. The following waste prevention strategies apply to both, although different approaches will be needed for implementation:&lt;ref name=guiding&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch9.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design." Chapter 9: Waste Prevention].&lt;/ref&gt;

* use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic
* compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes
* reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling
* consuming less resources means creating less waste, therefore it reduces the impact on the environment.

===Sustainable design principles===
[[File:CalifAcadamyOfSciAug28-2008img0640.JPG|thumb|290px|The [[California Academy of Sciences]], San Francisco, California, is a sustainable building designed by Renzo Piano. It opened on September 27, 2008]]
[[File:(1)Central building Broadway Sydney-1.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], [[Sydney]]]]

While the practical application varies among disciplines
, some common principles are as follows:
* Low-impact materials: choose non-toxic, sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process
* Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy
* [[Emotionally durable design]]: reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products, through design
* Design for reuse and [[recycling]]: "Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife'."&lt;ref&gt;Anastas, P. L. and Zimmerman, J. B. (2003). "[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es032373g Through the 12 principles of green engineering]". Environmental Science and Technology. March 1. 95-101A.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design impact measures]] for total [[carbon footprint]] and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available.^&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts.  One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of {{convert|8,000|btu|abbr=on}} per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of 0.57&amp;nbsp;kg of CO2 per dollar (1995 dollars US) from DOE figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html US DOE 20 yr Global Product &amp; Energy Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100643/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html |date=2007-06-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sustainable design standards]] and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals.  There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions.
* [[Biomimicry]]: "redesigning industrial systems on biological lines ... enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles..."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hawken, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins (1999). Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution. Little, Brown. {{ISBN|978-0-316-35316-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Service substitution]]: shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions, e.g., from a private automobile to a [[carsharing]] service. Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption (e.g., per trip driven).&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Chris (2006). "Dematerializing Consumption through Service Substitution is a Design Challenge". Journal of Industrial Ecology. 4(1). {{doi|10.1162/108819800569230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Renewable resource]]: materials should come from nearby (local or [[bioregion]]al), sustainably managed renewable sources that can be [[compost]]ed when their usefulness has been exhausted.
* [[Robust eco-design]]: robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I., Katz R. and Bukchin J., "[http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Eco_Design.pdf Robust Eco-Design: A New Application for Quality Engineering]", IIE Transactions, Vol. 40 (10), p. 907 - 918.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill of Rights for the Planet====
A model of the new design principles necessary for [[sustainability]] is exemplified by the "Bill of Rights for the Planet" or "Hannover Principles" -  developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO 2000 that was held in [[Hannover, Germany]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}
:''The Bill of Rights'':
# Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy, supportive, diverse, and sustainable conditions.
# Recognize Interdependence. The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world, with broad and diverse implications at every scale. Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects.
# Respect relationships between spirit and matter. Consider all aspects of human settlement including community, dwelling, industry, and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness.
# Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being, the viability of natural systems, and their right to co-exist.
# Create safe objects of long-term value. Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products, processes, or standards.
# Eliminate the concept of waste. Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes, to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste.
# Rely on natural energy flows. Human designs should, like the living world, derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income. Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use.
# Understand the limitations of design. No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems. Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature. Treat nature as a model and mentor, not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled.
# Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge. Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues, patrons, manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility, and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity.

These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA) in June 1993 at the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Expo 93 in [[Chicago]]. Further, the AIA and UIA signed a "Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future." In summary, the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA, UIA, and their members are committed to:

* Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities
* Developing and continually improving practices, procedures, products, services, and standards for sustainable design
* Educating the building industry, clients, and the general public about the importance of sustainable design
* Working to change policies, regulations, and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice
* Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards.

In addition, the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design (ICED), a coalition of architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering organizations, developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design. ICED states: The ethics, education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future. . . . To achieve this vision we will join . . . as a multidisciplinary partnership."

These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive. The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch1.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Applications of this philosophy range from the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] &amp;mdash; small objects for everyday use, through to the [[macrocosm]] &amp;mdash; buildings, cities, and the Earth's physical surface. It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[engineering]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[fashion design]] and [[human-computer interaction]].

Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global [[environmental crisis|environmental crises]], the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to [[ecosystem]]s, and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="shu-yang"&gt;Fan Shu-Yang, Bill Freedman, and Raymond Cote (2004). "[http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;journal=er&amp;volume=12&amp;calyLang=eng&amp;articleFile=a04-005.pdf Principles and practice of ecological design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160329/http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet |date=2004-08-14 }}". Environmental Reviews. 12: 97‚Äì112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, eco architecture writer [[Bridgette Meinhold]] surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book, ‚ÄúUrgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World.‚Äù&lt;ref name=wwnorton&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Bridgette|title=Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Urgent_Architecture.html?id=ib-nuAAACAAJ|publisher=W.

The limits of sustainable design are reducing. Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency. As a result, the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts.  The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services, does not solve this problem. The basic dilemmas include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements; the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones; that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized, but are distributed throughout the economies; and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing.

==Examples==

===Beauty and sustainable design===
Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics, some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration. [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winner [[Frank Gehry]] has called green building "bogus,"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Arndt, "[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2010/04/architect_gehry.html/ Architect Gehry on LEED Buildings: Humbug]", Bloomberg Businessweek, April 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Design Awards]] winner [[Peter Eisenman]] has dismissed it as "having nothing to do with architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curatorialproject.com/interviews/petereisenmanii.html/ Intercontinental Curatorial Project, Interview with Peter Eisenman, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The American Prospect]]'' asked whether "well-designed green architecture" is an "oxymoron."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-195324010/green-building-blues-is-well-designed-green-architecture/ Kriston Capps, "Green Building Blues," ''The American Prospect,'' February 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided. A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect [[Lance Hosey]], whose book ''[[The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design]]'' (2012) was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty. Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful, but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed, creating things of even greater beauty. Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in ''The Shape of Green'' could "revolutionize what it means to be sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderonline.com/design/not-pretty-then-its-not-green_o/|title=Not Pretty? Then It‚Äôs Not Green|author=Claire Easley|work=Builder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs. Examples include [[One Central Park]] and the [[Science Faculty building, UTS]].

===Emotionally durable design===

According to [[Jonathan Chapman (academic)|Jonathan Chapman]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], USA, emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of [[natural resources]] by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ‚ÄòDesign for [Emotional] Durability‚Äô, ''Design Issues'', vol xxv, Issue 4, Autumn, pp29-35, 2009 {{doi|10.1162/desi.2009.25.4.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 9/1/15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences &amp; Empathy'', Chapman describes how "the process of consumption is, and has always been, motivated by complex emotional drivers, and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things; it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self, that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment, becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emotionally-Durable-Design-Objects-Experiences/dp/1844071812 Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences and Empathy]'', Earthscan, London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a product requires an attribute, or number of attributes, which extend beyond utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 09/01/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chapman, 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements:
* '''Narrative''': How users share a unique personal history with the product.
* '''Consciousness''': How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will.
* '''Attachment''': Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product?
* '''Fiction''': The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship.
* '''Surface''': How the product ages and develops character through time and use.

As a strategic approach, "emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible, well made, tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term."&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, E. (2009). [http://www.ijdesign.org/ojs/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/571/263 Contemporary ceramic design for meaningful interaction and emotional durability: A case study]. ''International Journal of Design'', 3(2), 87-92&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of [[Parsons The New School for Design]] in New York, ‚Äúemotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users, as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to, and in, design things.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Clark, H. &amp; Brody, D., Design Studies: A Reader, Berg, New York, US, 2009, p531 {{ISBN|9781847882363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable architecture===
{{Main|Sustainable architecture}}
[[File:Sustainable.jpg|thumb|Sustainable building design]]

Sustainable architecture is the design of [[sustainable building]]s. Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the [[life cycle assessment|lifecycle]] of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; [[alternative energy]] sources such as [[solar hot water]], appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power; [[rainwater harvesting]] for gardening, washing and [[aquifer]] recharge; and on-site [[waste management]] such as [[green roof]]s that filter and control stormwater runoff. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation.&lt;ref name="plainiotis"&gt;Ji Yan and Plainiotis Stellios (2006): Design for Sustainability. Beijing: China Architecture and Building Press. {{ISBN|7-112-08390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable architects design with [[sustainable living]] in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable vs [[green design]] is the challenge that designs not only reflect [[healthy building|healthy]] processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources. A test for sustainable design is &amp;mdash; can the design function for its intended use without [[fossil fuel]] &amp;mdash; unplugged. This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution.  As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested, architects will soon be able to create not only passive, null-emission buildings, but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design.  In 2004 the 59 home housing community, the [[Solar Settlement]], and a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} integrated retail, commercial and residential building, the [[Sonnenschiff|Sun Ship]], were completed by architect [[Rolf Disch]] in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The [[Solar Settlement]] is the first housing community worldwide in which every home, all 59, produce a positive energy balance.&lt;ref name="Rolf Disch Solararchitektur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosting.more-elements.com/MoccaMS/projects/plusenergie/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=266&amp;L=0&amp;host=2|title=Rolf Disch - SolarArchitektur|work=more-elements.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011: "[https://osr.ashrae.org/Public%20Review%20Draft%20Standards%20Lib/Gdl-10P-PPR2-Draft%20_chair-approved-rev_.pdf Interactions Affecting the Achievement of Acceptable Indoor Environments]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=Charter of the New Urbanism|work=cnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable landscape and garden design===
{{Main|Sustainable landscape architecture|Sustainable landscaping|Sustainable gardening}}
'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of sustainable design and [[energy-efficient landscaping]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space. Plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation.
Design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind, using local materials, and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce [[green waste]] hauling but to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[Soil carbon|carbon]] in the [[soil]].

Some designers and gardeners such as [[Beth Chatto]] also use [[drought]]-resistant plants in arid areas ([[xeriscaping]]) and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and [[habitat]]s for [[irrigation]]. Water from building roofs may be collected in [[rain garden]]s so that the [[groundwater]] is recharged, instead of rainfall becoming [[surface runoff]] and increasing the risk of [[flooding]].

Areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage [[bio-diversity]]. Native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways: by plants which provide food such as [[nectar]] and [[pollen]] for insects, or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees, or habitats such as [[pond]]s for [[amphibian]]s and aquatic insects. [[Pesticide]]s, especially [[Chemical pesticides|persistent pesticides]], must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife.

Soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to [[Groundcover|ground-cover plants]] and [[mulch]]es to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[earthworms]] and [[mycorrhiza]]; [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]] instead of [[Nitrogen fertilizer#Inorganic fertilizers (mineral fertilizer)|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]]; and sustainably harvested [[Seaweed#Other uses|seaweed extract]] to replace [[Plant nutrition#Micro-nutrients|micronutrients]].

Sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental, growing food, firewood and craft materials from beautiful places.

Sustainable landscape approaches and labels include [[organic farming]] and [[Organic horticulture|growing]], [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[Forest gardening|forest gardens]], [[agroecology]], [[vegan organic gardening]], ecological gardening and [[climate-friendly gardening]].

===Sustainable agriculture===
:''Main: [[Sustainable agriculture|Organic farming]]
[[Sustainable agriculture]] adheres to three main goals:
*Environmental Health,
*Economic Profitability,
*Social and Economic Equity.
A variety of philosophies, policies and practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture.

There are strenuous discussions &amp;mdash; among others by the [[agricultural]] sector and authorities &amp;mdash; if existing pesticide protocols and methods of [[soil conservation]] adequately protect [[topsoil]] and [[wildlife]]. Doubt has risen if these are sustainable, and if [[organic gardening|agrarian reforms]] would permit an efficient [[agriculture]] with fewer [[pesticide]]s, therefore reducing the damage to the [[ecosystem]].

For more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070421034222/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm "UC Davis: Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program"].&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, G (December 1997).

===Domestic machinery and furniture===
{{Main|Home appliances}}
[[Automobile]]s, [[home appliance]]s and [[furniture]]s can be designed for repair and disassembly (for recycling), and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel, aluminum and glass, and renewable materials, such as [[Zelfo]], [[wood]] and plastics from natural feedstocks. Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-[[sustainable products]]. Even mild design efforts can greatly increase the sustainable content of manufactured items.

====Improvements to heating, cooling, ventilation and water heating====

* [[Seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES)
* [[Solar air conditioning]]
* [[Solar hot water]]
{{div col end}}

===Energy sector===
{{Main|Solar energy|Alternative energy}}
{{See also|Solar thermal collector|Solar panel|Passive solar building design}}
Sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[hydro power|hydro]], [[bioenergy]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], and [[hydrogen]]. Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source; it has been in use for centuries in [[Europe]] and more recently in the [[United States]] and other nations. Wind energy is captured through the use of [[wind turbine]]s that generate and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages. Solar power can be harnessed through [[photovoltaics]], concentrating solar, or [[solar hot water]] and is also a rapidly growing energy source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repp.org/index.html "Renewable Energy Policy Project &amp; CREST Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology"]&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in the technology and modifications to photovoltaics cells provide a more in depth untouched method for creating and producing solar power. Researchers have found a potential way to use the photogalvanic effect to transform sunlight into electric energy. &lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.022 "Solar energy conversion and storage: Rhodamine B - Fructose photogalvanic cell"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability, potential, and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan. The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to [[sustainable development]] and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch7.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". Chapter 7: Energy Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for sustainable manufacturing===
Sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability. The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]] in order to condition the related [[sustainability]] on [[product life cycle]] and Factory operations.
* Designing sustainable production systems imply, on the one hand, the analysis and optimization of intra-factory aspects that are related to [[manufacturing plants]]. Such aspects can regard the [[resource consumption]] restrain, the  process [[efficiency]], the [[ergonomics]] for the factory workers, the elimination of [[hazardous substances]], the minimization of factory emissions and waste as well as internal emissions, the integrated management of information in the production facilities, and the technological updating of machines and plants.
* Other inter-factories aspects concern the sustainable design of manufactured products, product chain [[Dematerialization (products)|dematerialisation]], management of the background and foreground [[supply chains]], support of [[circular economy]] paradigm, and the [[labelling]] for sustainability.

===Water sector===
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Rainwater harvesting|Stormwater harvesting}}
[[File:Rain Water storage.JPG|thumb|A 35,003 litre rainwater harvesting tank in [[Kerala]]]]

Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner.

Beyond the use of certain technologies, Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts. Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption, that is not necessarily for drinking purposes, is of potable water quality. This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called "fit-for-purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|title=Water recycling &amp; alternative water sources|work=health.vic.gov.au|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107231100/http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|archivedate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This more rational use of water achieves several economies, that are not only related to water itself, but also the consumption of energy, as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons.

==Terminology==
In some countries the term ''sustainable design'' is known as [[ecodesign]], [[green design]] or [[environmental design]]. [[Victor Papanek]], embraced [[social design]] and social quality and ecological quality, but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term. ''Sustainable design'' and ''design for sustainability'' are more common terms, including the [[triple bottom line]] (people, planet and profit).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the EU, the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign. Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the [[circular economy]] package, that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of 2015. To this effect, an Ecothis.EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ecothis.eu campaign website|url=http://www.ecothis.eu|publisher=ecothis.eu|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable technologies==
Sustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/sustainability-theme1/sustainable-roadmap |title=Sustainable Roadmap - Open Innovation |first= |last= |work=connect.innovateuk.org |year=2012 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant overlap with [[appropriate technology]], which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. However, the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an "appropriate technology," as that term is commonly used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">'''Sworn testimony''' is evidence given by a witness who has made a commitment to tell the [[truth]]. If the witness is later found to have lied whilst bound by the commitment, they can often be charged with the crime of [[perjury]]. The types of commitment can include oaths, affirmations and promises which are explained in more detail below. The exact wording of the commitments vary from country to country.

==Types of commitment==

The commitment can come in different forms depending on the situation of the witness. The types of commitment used in the [[United Kingdom]] are:

*'''Oath''': A commitment made to the witness's [[deity]], or on their holy book.
*'''Affirmation''': A [[Secularism|secular]] variant of the oath where the witness does not have to mention a deity or holy book.
*'''Promise''': A commitment made by a witness under the age of 17, or of all witnesses if none of the accused are over the age of 17.

==Variations by country==

===Australia===

====Victoria====
''Oath:''

In a social context, '''trust''' has several connotations.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, D. H., and Chervany, N. L. (1996). [http://www.misrc.umn.edu/wpaper/wp96-04.htm The Meanings of Trust. Scientific report, University of Minnesota.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083112/http://www.misrc.umn.edu/wpaper/wp96-04.htm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Davis | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Schoorman | first3 = F.D. | year = 1995 | title = An integrative model of organizational trust | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 709‚Äì734 | doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Walter (2010). [http://www.ldv.ei.tum.de/en/research/fidens/interpersonal-trust/ "Interpersonal Trust ‚Äì Attempt of a Definition"]. Scientific report, Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. Retrieved 2011-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects: One party (trustor) is willing to rely on the actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired.

Trust can be attributed to relationships between people. It can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain. Some studies indicate that trust can be altered e.g. by the application of [[oxytocin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M. | last3 = Zak | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Fischbacher | first4 = U. | last5 = Fehr | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Oxytocin increases trust in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = | pages = 673‚Äì676 | doi=10.1038/nature03701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to the relationship between people and technology, the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute. The [[intentional stance]]&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1989) The Intentional Stance. Bradford Books.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies. However, rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Shneiderman, B. (2000) Designing trust into online experiences. Communications of the ACM Volume 43, Number 12, Pages 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to re-think how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust. This is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (2005) Risk: a sociological theory. AldineTransaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social sciences, the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research. In [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of [[belief]] in the [[honesty]], fairness, or [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] of another party. The term "[[confidence]]" is more appropriate for a belief in the [[Skill|competence]] of the other party. A failure in trust may be [[forgive]]n more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MNkr0r5QZIYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=failure+in+trust+lack+of+competence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1EVV5YjwI&amp;sig=N8bNpc6hakMIcLcRtHH3YJ872cM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji6eSMkJbXAhUkMJoKHZBVCWsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Trust: Forms, Foundations, Functions, Failures and Figures|first=B.|last=Nooteboom|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions. In all cases trust is a [[heuristic]] decision rule, allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning.

==Sociology==
When it comes to trust, sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems. Interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties, from the early works of Luhmann,&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1979) Trust and Power. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Barber&lt;ref&gt;Barber, B. (1983) The Logic and Limits of Trust. Rutgerts University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Giddens&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1984). The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration; Polity Press, Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; (see&lt;ref&gt;Sztompka, P. (1999) Trust: A Sociological Theory. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for a more detailed overview). This growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by on-going changes in society, characterised as late [[modernity]] and [[post-modernity]].

Trust is one of several [[social constructs]], an element of the social reality.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. R. (1995) The Construction of Social Reality. The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exist outside of our vision of the other. This image can be real or imaginary, but it is this one which permits the creation of the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Trust|last=Allison I. Carter|first=Linda R. Weber|publisher=Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other constructs, frequently discussed together with trust, are: control, confidence, risk, meaning and power. Trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors, both individuals and groups (social systems). Because trust is a social construct, it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Gambetta, D. (2000) Can We Trust Trust? In: Gambetta, D. (ed.) Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations, electronic edition, Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, chapter 13, pp. 213-237.&lt;/ref&gt;), i.e. whether social trust operates as expected.

Sviatoslav contends that society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience, and contingency of new possibilities. Without trust, all contingent possibilities should be always considered, leading to a paralysis of inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braynov|first=Sviatoslav|date=2002|title=Contracting with uncertain level of Trust|url=|journal=Computational Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures, the one that may deliver benefits. Once the bet is decided (i.e. trust is granted), the trustor suspends his or her disbelief, and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all. Because of it, trust acts as a reductor of social complexity, allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered (or even impossible to consider at all); specifically for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bachmann | first1 = R | year = 2001 | title = Trust, Power and Control in Transorganizational Relations | url = | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 337‚Äì365 | doi=10.1177/0170840601222007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology tends to focus on two distinct views: the macro view of social systems, and a micro view of individual social actors (where it borders with [[social psychology]]). Similarly, views on trust follow this dichotomy. Therefore, on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed, with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust. The behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, J. (1990) Foundations of Social Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; while actions of social actors are measurable, leading to statistical modelling of trust. This systemic approach can be contrasted&lt;ref&gt;Castelfranchi, C., Falcone, R. (2000) Trust Is Much More than Subjective Probability: Mental Components and Sources of Trust. Proc. of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences-Volume 6.&lt;/ref&gt; with studies on social actors and their decision-making process, in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain (and allow to model) the emergence of trust.

Sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors, and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee. Trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency, being an attractive alternative to control.&lt;ref&gt;Mollering, G. (2005) The Trust/Control Duality: An Integrative Perspective on Positive Expectations of Others. In: Int. Sociology, September 2005, Vol. 20(3): 283‚Äì305. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor, yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;Baier, A. (1986) Trust and antitrust. Ethics, vol. 96, pp. 231-260. Reprinted in: Moral Prejudices. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards post-modern society, but they also challenged traditional views on trust. Empirical studies&lt;ref&gt;Lacoh√©e, H., Cofta, P., Phippen, A., and Furnell, S. (2008) Understanding Public Perceptions: Trust and Engagement in ICT Mediated Services. International Engineering Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust. Trust is not attributable to artefacts, but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers, creators and operators of technology. Properties of technological artefacts form a message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bohmann | first1 = K | year = 1989 | title = About the Sense of Social Compatibility | url = | journal = [[AI &amp; Society]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 323‚Äì331 | doi=10.1007/bf01908622}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine trustworthiness of those agents.

The discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress. However, a conceptual re-thinking of technology-mediated social groups,&lt;ref&gt;Willson, M. A. (2006) Technically Together: Rethinking Community within Techno-society. Peter Lang Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; or the proposition of a unifying socio-technical view on trust,&lt;ref&gt;Cofta, P. (2007). Trust, Complexity and Control: Confidence in a Convergent World. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; from the perspective of social actors.

==Psychology==

In psychology, trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected. It starts at the family and grows to others. According to the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Erik Erikson]] development of basic trust is the [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|first state of psychosocial development]] occurring, or failing, during the first two years of life. Success results in feelings of security, trust, and optimism, while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Child Development Institute Parenting Today |url=http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/erickson.shtml |title=Stages of Social-Emotional Development In Children and Teenagers |publisher=Childdevelopmentinfo.com |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002220833/http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/erickson.shtml |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly resulting in [[attachment disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter. ''Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis''. Other Press Professional, 2010. Print. {{ISBN|1590514602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a [[personality trait]] and as such is one of the strongest predictors of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197‚Äì229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that trust increases subjective well-being because it enhances the quality of one's interpersonal relationships, and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=1999|volume=8|pages=141‚Äì144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/8/5/141.abstract|issue=5|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trust is integral to the idea of [[social influence]]: it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting. The notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others, [[Institutional trust|institution]]s (e.g. [[government agency|government agencies]]) and objects such as [[machine]]s. However, once again perception of honesty, competence and value similarity (slightly similar to benevolence) are essential. There are three different forms of trust. Trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy; trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person, and trust propensity being able to rely on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=main.showContent&amp;view=fulltext&amp;format=HTML&amp;id=2007-09571-002|title=PsycNET|website=Psycnet.apa.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once trust is lost, by obvious violation of one of these three determinants, it is very hard to regain. Thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust. Hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level.

Increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications:

* Barbara Misztal, in her book,&lt;ref name="BarbaraMisztal"&gt;Barbara Misztal, ''Trust in Modern Societies: The Search for the Bases of Social Order'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-1634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to combine all notions of trust together. She points out ''three basic things that trust does in the lives of people'': It makes social life ''predictable'', it creates a ''sense of [[community]]'', and it ''makes it easier for people to work together''.
* In the context of sexual trust Riki Robbins&lt;ref name="RikiRobbins"&gt;Riki Robbins, ''Betrayed!: How You Can Restore Sexual Trust and Rebuild Your Life'', Adams Media Corporation, {{ISBN|1-55850-848-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes four stages of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerself.com/Relationships/Four_Stages_of_Trust.htm |title=Four stages of trust |publisher=Innerself.com |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the context of [[Information theory]] Ed Gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as [[Power (philosophy)|power]], surveillance, and [[accountability]].&lt;ref name="Ed Gerck"&gt;Ed Gerck, ''Trust Points'', Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security by J. Feghhi, J. Feghhi and P. Williams, Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Gerck |url=http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm |title=Definition of trust |publisher=Mcwg.org |date=1998-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From a [[social identity]] perspective, the propensity to trust in strangers (see [[in-group favoritism]]) arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership,&lt;ref name=Platow2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Platow |first1=M. J. |last2=Foddy |first2=M. |last3=Yamagishi |first3=T. |last4=Lim |first4=L. |last5=Chow |first5=A. |year=2012 |title=Two experimental tests of trust in in-group strangers: The moderating role of common knowledge of group membership |url=|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=42 |issue=|pages=30‚Äì35 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; stereotypes,&lt;ref name=Foddy2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foddy |first1=M. |last2=Platow |first2=M.J. |last3=Yamagishi |first3=T. |year=2009 |title=Group-based trust in strangers: The role of stereotypes and expectations |url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=|pages=419‚Äì422 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02312.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the need to maintain the group's positive distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;

In addition to the social influence, in organizational settings, trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors, perceptions, and [[performance]]s of a person. Trust has a circular relationship with [[organizational justice]] perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which, in turn, promotes future perceptions of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeConick | first1 = J. B. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of organizational justice, perceived organizational support, and perceived supervisor support on marketing employees' level of trust | url = | journal = Journal of Business Research | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1349‚Äì1355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance. Through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a two-person sequential trust game, supporting evidence was found that having similar [[facial feature]]s (facial resemblance) enhanced trust in a subject‚Äôs respective partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Facial resemblance enhances trust|author=Lisa M. DeBruine|date=7 July 2002|journal=Trust|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2034|volume=269|pages=1307‚Äì1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust, facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner. In a series of tests, digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship. The results showed that within the context of a short term relationship, which is dependent on sexual desire, similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire. Within the context of a long term relationship, which is dependent on trust, similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual, leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBruine|first=Lisa|title=Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: context-specific effects of facial resemblance|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=3 November 2005|volume=272|issue=1566|pages=919‚Äì22|jstor=30047623|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3003|pmid=16024346|pmc=1564091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace. Working anywhere may be [[Workplace stress|stress]]ful and takes effort. By having a conveniently organized area to work on, concentration will increase as well as effort. Structure is not just a method of order. It increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable. A structured, ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level.

People may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual‚Äôs contribution.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of Trust in Organizational Settings, Kurt T. Dirks, Donald L. Ferrin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, where trust is absent, projects can fail, especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed. This is one facet of [[VPEC-T]] analysis: This thinking framework is used when studying information systems. Identifying and dealing with cases where information providers, information users, and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project.

One's social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement. Individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Roger.

An important key to treating [[sexual victimization]] of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child. Failure for the adults to validate the [[sexual abuse]] contributes to the child's difficulty towards trusting self and others.&lt;ref&gt;TIMMONS-MITCHELL, JANE.

===Social identity approach===
The [[social identity approach]] explains trust in strangers as a function of group-based stereotypes or [[ingroup favoritism|in-group favouring]] behaviours based on [[self-categorization theory|salient group memberships]]. With regard to ingroup favoritism, people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from in-group members in comparison to out-group members. This greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an in-group rather than out-group member.&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt; It has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an in-group stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;

There is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach. Allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand group-based trust in strangers.&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Foddy2008&gt;Foddy, M., &amp; Dawes, R. (2008). Group-based trust in social dilemmas. In A. Biel, D. Eek, T. Garling, &amp; M. Gustafsson (Eds.), New Issues and Paradigms in Research on Social Dilemmas (pp. 57-85). New York, USA: Springer Science and Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guth2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guth | first1 = W. | last2 = Levati | first2 = M.V. | last3 = Ploner | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Social identity and trust ‚Äì An experimental investigation | url = | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1293‚Äì1308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange. General social categories such as university affiliation, course majors, and even ad-hoc groups have been used to distinguish between in-group and out-group members. In unilateral studies of trust, the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an in-group or out-group member.&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt; They would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction, simulating Brewer‚Äôs notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about group-based trust and hence cooperation.&lt;ref name=Brewer1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M.B. | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of prejudice: Ingroup love or outgroup hate? | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 429‚Äì444 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out. In bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by Berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another.&lt;ref name=Berg1995&gt;Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., &amp; McCabe, K. (1995). Trust, reciprocity, and social history. Games and Economic Behaviour, 10, 122-142&lt;/ref&gt; Any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender. Trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money.&lt;ref name=Tanis2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tanis |first1=M. |last2=Postmes |first2=T. |year=2005 |title=A social identity approach to trust: Interpersonal perception, group membership and trusting behaviour |url=|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=|pages=413‚Äì424 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;

The above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties, trust is granted more readily to in-group members than out-group members.&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guth2006"/&gt; This occurred even when the in-group stereotype was comparatively less positive than an out-group‚Äôs (e.g. psychology versus nursing majors),&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; in the absence of personal identity cues,&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money (i.e. in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger).&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt; In contrast, when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; The group with the more positive stereotype was trusted (e.g. one‚Äôs university affiliation over another),&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; even over that of the in-group (e.g. nursing over psychology majors).&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; Another reason for in-group favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain in-group [[Social identity theory#Positive distinctiveness|positive distinctiveness]], particularly in the presence of social identity threat.&lt;ref name="Guth2006"/&gt; It should also be noted that trust in out-group strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed.&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance. Philosophers such as Annette Baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed, whilst reliance can only be disappointed (Baier 1986, 235).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baier, Annette|date=1986|title=Trust and Antitrust|journal=Ethics|volume=96 | issue = 2 |pages=231‚Äì260|jstor=2381376|doi=10.1086/292745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn McLeod explains Baier's argument by giving the following examples: we can rely on our clock to give the time, but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks, thus, we cannot say that we trusted it; we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person, because this is in fact an expression of distrust (McLeod 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entriesrust/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Carolyn|last=McLeod|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed.

The definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something&lt;ref&gt;"trust." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 25 May. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition, because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable. For example, to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years, is a confident expectation (whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals.) The trust is not about what we wish for, rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits. As a result, there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge.

==Economics==
{{see also|Consumer confidence}}
Trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize one's utility. In economic terms, trust can provide an explanation of a difference between [[Nash equilibrium]] and the observed equilibrium. Such an approach can be applied to individuals as well as societies.

Trust is also seen as an economic lubricant, reducing the cost of transactions between parties, enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities;&lt;ref name="Morgan 20‚Äì38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Robert|author2=Hunt, S. |authorlink2=Shelby D. Hunt |title=The Commitment-Trust Theory of Relationship Marketing|journal=The Journal of Marketing|date=July 1994|volume=58|issue=3|pages=20‚Äì38|doi=10.2307/1252308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zheng, J.|author2=Roehrich, J.K.|author3=Lewis, M.A.|date=2008|title=The dynamics of contractual and relational governance: Evidence from long-term public-private procurement arrangements|journal=Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management|volume=14 | issue = 1 |pages=43‚Äì54|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-41049112855&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=yXIvJQ7AsPq0YyDQfJmJLCa%3a2|doi=10.1016/j.pursup.2008.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; employment and prosperity. This observation &lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1996) Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity, Touchstone Books.&lt;/ref&gt; created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of [[social capital]] and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital. It has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development. Even though the original concept of 'high trust' and 'low trust' societies may not necessarily hold, it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy &lt;ref&gt;Zak, P. J., and Knack, S. (2001) Trust and growth. Economic Journal,111: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2667866 295]-321.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth.

Theoretical economical modelling &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braynov | first1 = S. | last2 = Sandholm | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Contracting With Uncertain Level Of Trust | url = | journal = Computational Intelligence | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 501‚Äì514 | doi=10.1111/1467-8640.00200}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party. Such a level of trust leads to efficient market. Trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities, trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation.

Economics is also interested in quantifying trust, usually in monetary terms. The level of correlation between increase in [[profit margin]] &lt;ref&gt;Resnick, P. (2006) The value of reputation on eBay: a controlled experiment. Experimental Economics, volume 9, Issue 2, Jun 2006, Page 79-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust.

Economic 'trust games' are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions. There are several games and game-like scenarios related to trust that have been tried, with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Keser, C. (2003) Experimental games for the design of reputation management systems. IBM Systems J., vol. 42, no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Games of trust are designed in a way that their Nash equilibrium differ from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit.

The classical version of the game of trust has been described in &lt;ref&gt;Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., and McCabe, K. (1995) Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History, Games and Economic Behavior 10, 122‚Äì142. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WFW-45NJFPR-14&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=07/31/1995&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=49474c64b2d97b84891f6009445ffd76&amp;searchtype=a Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; as an abstracted investment game, using the scenario of an investor and a broker. Investor can invest a fraction of his money, and broker can return only part of his gains. If both players follow their economical best interest, the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to re-pay anything. Thus the flow of money flow, its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust.

The game can be played as one-off, or as a repetitive one, between the same or different sets of players, to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships. Several other variants of this game exist. Reversing rules lead to the game of distrust, pre-declarations can be used to establish intentions of players,&lt;ref&gt;Airiau, S., and Sen, S. (2006) Learning to Commit in Repeated Games. In: Proc. of the Fifth Int. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS06).&lt;/ref&gt; while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players. The game can be also played by several players on the closed market,&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. E., Katok, E., and Ockenfels, A. (2003) How Effective are Electronic Reputation Mechanisms? An Experimental Investigation.&lt;/ref&gt; with or without information about reputation.

Other interesting games are e.g. binary-choice trust games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camerer | first1 = C. | last2 = Weigelt | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Experimental Tests of a Sequential Equilibrium Reputation Model | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1‚Äì36 | doi=10.2307/1911840| citeseerx = 10.1.1.458.4383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the gift-exchange game &lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Kirchsteiger, G., and Riedl, A. (1993) Does Fairness Prevent Market Clearing? An Experimental Investigation. Quarterly Journal of Economics 108(May), pp. 437-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other forms of social games. Specifically games based on the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] &lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, W. (1992) Prisoner's Dilemma. Doubleday, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity.

The work of [[Rachel Botsman]] is also very important about collaboration economy.

The popularisation of [[e-commerce]] opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust, and desire to understand customer decision to trust.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, D., H., Chervany, N. L. (2001) Conceptualizing Trust: A Typology and E-Commerce Customer Relationships Model. Proc. of the 34th Hawaii Int. Conf. on System Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, inter-personal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been dis-intermediated by the technology,&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1991) Modernity and Self-identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age. Polity Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and had to be improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Golbeck, J. (2008). Computing with Social Trust. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller, regardless of seller's actual trustworthiness (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, F. N. From Interactions to Transactions: Designing the Trust Experience for Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce. PhD Thesis, Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands).&lt;/ref&gt;) . Reputation-based systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness, generating significant interest in various models of reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, E., Dillion, T., Hussain, F. K. (2006) Trust and Reputation for Service-Oriented Environments: Technologies for Building Business Intelligence and Consumer Confidence. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems==
In [[systems]], a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on. If A trusts B, this means that a violation in those properties of B might compromise the correct operation of A. Observe that those properties of B trusted by A might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to B‚Äôs actual properties. This happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account. In consequence, trust should be placed to the extent of the component‚Äôs trustworthiness. The trustworthiness of a component is thus, not surprisingly, defined by how well it secures a set of functional and non-functional properties, deriving from its architecture, construction, and environment, and evaluated as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38179">The '''Violence Against Women Act of 1994''' ('''VAWA''') is a [[United States federal law]] (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], {{USBill|103|hr|3355}}) signed as {{USPL|103|322}} by [[US President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on September 13, 1994 (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. sections 13701 through 14040). The Act provided $1.6 billion toward investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. The Act also established the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

VAWA was drafted by the office of [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Delaware|DE]]) and co-written by Democrat [[Louise Slaughter]], the Representative from New York, with support from a broad coalition of advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/2014_vawa_report.pdf]|title=Report: 1 Is Too Many: Twenty Years Fighting Violence Against Women and Girls from The White House|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act passed through [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] with bipartisan support in 1994, clearing the [[United States House of Representatives]] by a vote of 235‚Äì195 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a vote of 61‚Äì38, although the following year House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut the Act's funding.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Washington Post]] | title = House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | first = Kenneth | last = Cooper | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | date = July 15, 1995 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | archivedate = July 24, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[United States v.

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that [[domestic violence]] is a public health policy and [[human rights]] concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|sexual violence]] induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M. C. et al. ''[http://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report]''. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with advocates and professionals from the battered women's movement, sexual assault advocates, victim services field, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar urging Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence [citation needed]. One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels [citation needed].  VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations that are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women.

Many grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in the U.S. Department of Justice have received appropriations from Congress:

* STOP Grants (State Formula Grants)
* Transitional Housing Grants
* Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforce Protection Orders
* Court Training and Improvement Grants
* Research on Violence Against Native American Women
* National Tribal [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry]]
* Stalker Reduction Database
* Federal Victim Assistants
* Sexual Assault Services Program
* Services for Rural Victims
* Civil Legal Assistance for Victims
* Elder Abuse Grant Program
* Protections and Services for Disabled Victims
* Combating Abuse in Public Housing
* National Resource Center on Workplace Responses
* Violence on College Campuses Grants
* Safe Havens Project
* Engaging Men and Youth in Prevention

==Debate and legal standing==
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was "repugnant" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen‚Äôs [[right to privacy]], and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: "Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate", dated September 29, 1994). The ACLU has, however, supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the "unconstitutional DNA provision" be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction |title=Tell Congress to Support the Violence Against Women Act|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116000141/https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction|archivedate=2005-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to [[violence against women]] and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|publisher=ACLU|date=July 27, 2005|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists oppose the bill. Janice Shaw Course, a senior fellow at [[Concerned Women for America]]'s Beverly LaHaye Institute called the Act a "boondoggle" which "ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims". She described the Act as creating a "climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as leading to violent, abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crouse |first=Janice Shaw |date=March 19, 2012 |title=The Violence Against Women Act Should Outrage Decent People |url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |work=U.S. News and World Report |type=Opinion |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103052355/https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |archivedate=November 3, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] denounced VAWA as a tool to "fill feminist coffers" and argued that the Act promoted "divorce, breakup of marriage and [[misandry|hatred of men]]".&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held part of VAWA unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' on federalism grounds. In that decision, only the civil rights remedy of VAWA was struck down. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 United States v.

In 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of "Underserved Populations" described as " Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] or by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] as appropriate".&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"&gt;Olivares, Mariela. 2014.

In 2011, the law expired.&lt;ref name="USAT021213" /&gt; In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolduan|first=Kate|title=House passes GOP version of Violence Against Women Act renewal|newspaper=CNN|location=Washington|date=16 May 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623034529/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the legislation have been passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and [[LGBT]] individuals. Another area of contention is the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. This provision is considered to have constitutional implications,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} as non-tribes people are under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government and are granted the protections of the U.S. Constitution, protections that tribal courts do not often have. The two bills were pending [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.

The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered undocumented individuals to claim [[visa (document)|temporary visas]], also known as [[U visa]]s.&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weisman | first = Jonathan | date = March 14, 2012 | title = Women Figure Anew in Senate's Latest Battle | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | archivedate = April 30, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U visa is restricted to 10,000 applicants annually whereas the number of applicants far exceeds these 10,000 for each fiscal year.&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"/&gt; In order to be considered for the U visa, one of the requirements for immigrant women is that they need to cooperate in the detention of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Susan. 2009.

In April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence). Reconciliation of the two bills was stymied by procedural measures, leaving the re-authorization in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | title = THE CAUCUS; G.O.P.

In 2013, the question of jurisdiction over offenses in Indian country continued to be at issue over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by [[tribal court]]s or afforded constitutional guarantees.&lt;ref name=NYT021013&gt;{{cite news|title=Measure to Protect Women Stuck on Tribal Land Issue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|author=Jonathan Weisman|quote=If a Native American is raped or assaulted by a non-Indian, she must plead for justice to already overburdened United States attorneys who are often hundreds of miles away.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211132940/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|archivedate=February 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persons who are covered under VAWA immigration provisions==
VAWA allows for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them.  The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:
* A wife or husband who has been abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder) spouse. The petition will also cover the petitioner‚Äôs children under age 21.
* A child abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. The petition can be filed by an abused child or by her parent on the child‚Äôs behalf. 
* A parent who has been abused by a U.S. citizen child who is at least 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAWA: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT|publisher=Givi Kutidze|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206032636/http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|archivedate=December 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage of male victims==
Although the title of the Act and the titles of its sections refer to victims of domestic violence as women, the operative text is gender-neutral, providing coverage for male victims as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994|number=H.R. 3355|language=English|date=1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230817/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|archivedate=2014-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual organizations have not been successful in using VAWA to provide equal coverage for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Robert|title=VAWA must be reformed for domestic violence rates to come down|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|work=The Hill|date=February 4, 2013|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202131901/http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has twice been amended in attempts to address this situation. The 2005 reauthorization added a non-exclusivity provision clarifying that the title should not be construed to prohibit male victims from receiving services under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005|number=H.R. 3402|language=English|date=2005|article=Sec. 3(b)(8)|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3402/text|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230616/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3402/text|archivedate=2014-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 reauthorization added a non-discrimination provision that prohibits organizations receiving funding under the Act from discriminating on the basis of sex, although the law allows an exception for "sex segregation or sex-specific programming" when it is deemed to be "necessary to the essential operations of a program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|number=S. 47|language=English|date=2013|article=Sec. 3(b)(4)|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s47/text|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716093330/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s47/text|archivedate=2016-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Brown, the Founder and Executive Director of the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women contends that the Act may not be sufficient to ensure equal access to services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving Our Men - The Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women|publisher=Laws.com|date=June 13, 2013|url=http://criminal.laws.com/criminal-news/saving-our-men-the-domestic-abuse-helpline-for-men-women-36561.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805042108/http://criminal.laws.com/criminal-news/saving-our-men-the-domestic-abuse-helpline-for-men-women-36561.html |archivedate=August 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">The '''World Organisation Against Torture''' (''Organisation Mondiale Contre la Torture''; '''OMCT''') is the world‚Äôs largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against [[arbitrary detention]], [[torture]], [[summary execution|summary]] and [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[forced disappearance]]s and other forms of [[violence]]. The global network consists of almost 300 local, national and regional organisations, which share the goal of eradicating torture and fostering respect of [[human rights]] for all.

The OMCT's ''Prevention of Torture'' programme helps its members prevent and report torture by strengthening their capacity through the SOS-Torture network to use [[United Nations]] [[human rights]] mechanisms. The programme submits alternative reports to UN Committees in collaboration with local [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, provides support for individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal fora and publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. OMCT is also [[Gender mainstreaming|mainstreaming]] women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs issues into the UN human rights mechanisms.

On 4 October 2007, former [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] became the new president of the OMCT Supporting Foundation.[http://www.omct.org/index.php?id=&amp;lang=eng&amp;actualPageNumber=1&amp;articleId=7286&amp;itemAdmin=article&amp;PHPSESSID=9d4fce0157f23ed08fa9ee8354df5124]

==Activities==
OMCT contributes to UN activities through three main activities.
===Reporting===
OMCT submits alternative reports to the UN [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] (CAT), the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) and the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), working with local NGOs. 
Reporting activities are designed to encourage national NGOs to report torture and follow up reports of torture through:
*the participation of local NGOs in drafting alternative reports and actively including them in relevant Committees‚Äô sessions, with the possibility of a follow-up meeting in the field;
*an integrated approach to questions relating to protection from torture and other ill-treatment of women and children, by involving organisations specialised in these issues in drafting alternative reports and in relevant Committees‚Äô sessions;
*greater dissemination of reports and of the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committees in English and in the preferred language of the relevant country, through the publication of the reports that have been submitted.

===Legal support===
OMCT supports individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal forums. Complaint mechanisms can be used to achieve a number of different objectives including: 
*protection for victims or persons under threat; 
*obtaining [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] and [[Damages|compensation]] for victims; 
*putting pressure on governments to end [[impunity]] in specific cases; and 
*achieving changes in legislation and State practice which lead to serious human rights violations. 
Many NGOs are not fully aware of how to use UN procedures to support their work in protecting victims from torture. OMCT hopes to encourage and assist partner NGOs that are already active in the struggle against torture to present individual complaints and other relevant information to the CAT, the HRC, and the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW).
===Practical guidance===
OMCT publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. This Handbook is conceived as a tool for action. It addresses the practical needs of anybody using international mechanisms and bodies to challenge torture practices.
