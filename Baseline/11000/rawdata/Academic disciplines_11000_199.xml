''''The All-Species Living Tree' Project''' is a collaboration between various academic groups/institutes, such as [[ARB Project|ARB]], SILVA rRNA database project, and [[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature|LPSN]], with the aim of assembling a database of [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] sequences of all validly published species of ''[[Bacteria]]'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.&lt;ref name=Yarza2008&gt;{{Cite journal

Currently there are over 10,950 species in the aligned dataset and several more are being added either as new species are discovered or species that are not represented in the database are sequenced. Initially the latter group consisted of 7% of species.

{{See also|Bacterial phyla}}
The tree was created by [[maximum likelihood]] analysis without bootstrap: consequently accuracy is traded off for size and many phylum level clades are not correctly resolved (such as the Firmicutes). (Eukaryotes not present in analysis). This 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree is based on the ARB-SILVA release LTPs 121 (June 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = ARB-SILVA release LTPs 121: overview| url=http://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_121/LTPs121_SSU_tree_overview.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = ARB-SILVA release LTPs 121: full tree| url=http://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_121/LTPs121_SSU_tree.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains all type species with validly published names.

'''ABH antigens secretion''', i.e.  presence ([[phenotype]]: ''secretor'' - '''''Se''''') or absence (''nonsecretor'': '''''se''''') of [[ABO blood group system]] [[antigen]]s in [[saliva]], [[milk]], [[sweat]], [[amnion|amniotic]] fluid, [[urine]], [[feces]] and other [[Anatomy|body]] fluids is one of the most famous [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in the field of [[blood]] antigens in body [[excretion]]s. On red blood [[cell (biology)|cells]] they are in the form of fat-soluble [[glycolipid]]s, and in secretions they occur as water-soluble [[glycoprotein]]s. Previous research has shown that the [[allele]] ''Se'' is completely dominant over the allele ''se''.&lt;ref name="mohr"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Estimation of linkage between the ''Lutheran'' and the ''Lewis'' blood groups. | author=Mohr, J. | journal=Acta path. microbiol.

Davis Co.,  Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene function==
Secretor locus is linked to the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of ''Lutheran'' blood antigens locus were found. Parental couples with the ability to determine the secretor status of the offsprings from  this linkage potentially allows prenatal diagnosis of [[myotonic dystrophy]] (''DM''). Se locus and the ''Hh'' (''[[FUT1]]'') locus may be closely linked were also suggested.

==Recessive phenotype distribution==
The secretion of water-soluble ''A'', ''B'' and ''H'' antigens was most widely studied in the saliva. A wide variation in the frequency of the recessive phenotype (nonsecretor: '''''se''''') was registered.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd W. C. (1950): Genetics and the races of man.

== Background ==

=== History ===
Agroecological methods have been practiced in Latin America for centuries, but the term agroecology in reference to the combination of [[agronomy]] and [[ecology]] was coined in 1928 by B.M. Bensin in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wezel A. et al. "Agroecology as a science, a movement and a practice. A review."''Agronomy for Sustainable Development.''Vol. 29, Iss. 4, (2009): 503–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1960s, it mainly focused on the scientific aspects of agronomy and ecology and remained relatively unknown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, due to the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of pesticides and the burgeoning [[environmental movement]] in the1970s, agroecology gained momentum globally and began to integrate a much wider range of issues on top of ecological ones, such as the social, political, economic implications of agroecosystems. In this context, the scientific aspect of agroecology began to engage in dialogue with traditional local farming practices and experimentation in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Pimbert, M. "Agroecology as an alternative vision to conventional development and climate-smart agriculture." ''Society for International Development,'' 58(2-3), (2015): 286-298. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between agronomists and traditional practitioners, often [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]], has been termed an "exchange of wisdoms." This recognizes that science is an important way of knowing and mode of discovery, while local knowledge systems developed over thousands of years have just as much to offer.

In Latin America specifically, agroecology spread more widely during the period of structural adjustment policies in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this time, many Latin American countries took up loans from the [[International Monetary Fund]] with strict conditions of [[Trade-liberalization|trade liberalization]] that allowed large transnational corporations to [[Land grabbing|grab]] huge swaths of [[Land grabbing|land]] and out-compete local markets.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;SOCLA, Sociedad Científica Latinoamericana de Agroecología“The role of Agroecology on the future of agriculture and the food system.” ''Latin American Scientific Society of Agroecology,'' (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; While many small farmers have been marginalized, many others have joined together to form cooperatives, social movements, and global organizations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosset, P. M., and M. E. Martínez-Torres. (2012). ''Rural social movements and agroecology: context, theory, and process.'' Ecology and Society 17(3): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ongoing work of these [[social movement]]s, agroecology has grown to mean more than just the combination of agronomy and ecology; it has come to involve many farmers, researchers, practitioners, and advocates, on a global scale, with a particularly strong presence in Latin America.

== Benefits ==
Traditional farming systems of Latin America were forged from a need to subsist on limited means. These techniques were developed from centuries of cultural and biological evolution by combining experiences and methods of other peasant farmers using locally available resources.&lt;ref name="Solis-Montero,Lislie 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solis-Montero | first1 = Lislie | last2 = Flores-Palacios | first2 = Alejandro | last3 = Cruz-Angon | first3 = Andrea | year = 2004 | title = Shade-Coffee Plantations as Refuges for Tropical Wild Orchids in Central Veracruz, Mexico | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00482.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 19| issue = 3| pages = 908–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its origins Latin American, agroecology represents a low impact form of agriculture. Modern agriculture had become a process of "artificialization of nature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altieri | first1 = Miguel A | year = 2000 | title = Multifunctional Dimensions of Ecologically-based Agriculture in Latin America | url = | journal = International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 62–75 | doi=10.1080/13504500009470029}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a monoculture of a very few crop species. Agroecology contrasts industrial agriculture in its use of [[polyculture]], lack of synthetic fertilizers, minimal machinery and incorporation of successional stages. Agroecology attempts to benefit both people and the environment by maximizing crop yield, but also preserving the natural environment. It is often practiced by forming agroecosystems which are communities of plants and animals interacting with their physical and chemical environment that have been planted and harvested by people.&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 2002"/&gt;

=== Economic benefits ===
Agroecological principles allow farmers to save many in several important ways: becoming independent from large corporations' inputs such as GMO seeds and fertilizers; having a more diversified and thus more resilient crop system where income does not depend on one single crop; using simple, cost-effective techniques to increase productivity; having solidarity markets with local communities and thus a steady source of income; having a democratized method of knowledge and seed exchange.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Altieri, M. (1999). Applying agroecology to enhance the productivity of peasant farming systems in Latin America. ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific examples of economically successful agroecological systems include stabilizing hillside farming in [[Honduras]]. [[World Neighbors]], an NGO, partnered with Honduran farmers to implement a program that helped practice soil conservation using techniques such as drainage and contour ditches, grass barriers, rock walls, and [[Organic fertilizer|organic fertilization]] (e.g., use of [[Poultry litter|chicken manure]] and [[intercropping]] with legumes).&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 1998" /&gt; These changes allowed for an increase in grain yield of three to four times more than in previous years as well as supplied 1,200 families with grain.

Another example, from the Andean region in Peru where a partnership of NGOs and locals lead to the  implementation of a Pre-Columbian indigenous technique called [[Waru Waru]]s. This technique involved raising the fields and surrounding them with dug out ditches filled with water, which regulates the soil temperature allowing for an extended growing season. In the district of Huatta, this method of using waru-warus have increased annual potato yields by 4-10 metric tons per hectare.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steinberg | first1 = Michael K | year = 1998 | title = Neotropical Kitchen Gardens as a Potential Research Landscape for Conservation Biologists | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 1150–152 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.98086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final example from the Andean region where some peasant communities in [[Cajamarca]] and NGOs planted more than 550,000 trees and reconstructed terraces as well as drainage and infiltration canals.This change allowed for about half the population in the area - 1,247 families - to have land under conservation measures. For these people, potato yields have increased from 5 to 8 tons per hectare and oca ([[wood sorrel]]) yields have jumped from 3 to 8 tons per hectare.&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 1998"/&gt; [[File:Intercropping coffee tomatoes.jpg|thumb|Intercropping coffee and tomatoes]]

=== Ecological benefits ===
The benefits of agroecology are not only economic, but also vitally important ecologically. There is evidence to indicate that the agroecosystems with overstory shade trees like coffee or cacao plantations can rival the biodiversity of natural forests.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = J.C. | year = 1980 | title = Seasonal and size patterns, trophic structure, and richness of coleoptera in the tropical arboreal ecosystem: the fauna of the tree Leubea seemannii Triana and Planch in the Canal Zone of Panama | url = | journal = Coleopterist Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 305–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estrada | first1 = A. | last2 = Coates-Estrada | first2 = R. | last3 = Merrit Jr | first3 = D. | year = 1993 | title = Bat species richness and abundance in tropical rainforest fragments and in agricultural habitats at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico | url = | journal = Ecography | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 309–318 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity is so high in these systems because the overstory is structurally and floristically complex&lt;ref name="Perfecto, Ivette 1996"/&gt; which allows for many different niches to be available resulting in refuges. It is possible that shade coffee plantations are already serving as refuges, as seen in Puerto Rico where tremendous deforestation has occurred and yet the avian extinction rate is relatively low.&lt;ref name="Perfecto, Ivette 1996"/&gt; Another system that is ecologically important is neotropical kitchen gardens. Kitchen gardens or home gardens are common in tropical and subtropical areas and they provide food and income for the family.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt; Some kitchen gardens like the Mopan Mayan of southern Belize contain dozens of tree and plant species of different stories mimicking a natural forest.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt; These patches, much like shade plantations, serve as refuges for flora and fauna such as in Belize where they are used by migratory birds.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt;

Agroecological farms and methods also contribute to reducing the effects of climate change as they have more plants and thus greater carbon sequestration as well as limited emissions from farm management and crop transportation. Agroecology in Latin America also includes many ecological areas such as water conservation, soil health, and maintaining seed diversity, among others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;La ViaCampesina's Brochure. Web. October 20. 2017. viacampesina.org https://viacampesina.org/en/la-via-campesina-organisational-brochure-edition-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social benefits ===
The principles of agroecology are also integrally cultural and social. Agroecology is the “transformation of rural realities through collective action” for the goal of food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus it is not just science and principles, but also a practice, which produces many social benefits as it is a combination of efforts between farmers, social movements, scientists, and NGOs, as well as occasionally local governments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Altieri, M &amp; Toledo V.M. (2011). The agroecological revolution in Latin America: rescuing nature, ensuring food sovereignty and empowering peasants. The Journal of Peasant Studies 38:3: 587–612&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Food sovereignty]] is a core component of agroecology that increases social power. The definition of food sovereignty as defined by [[Via Campesina|La Via Campesina]], the social movement that articulated it, is the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It develops a model of small scale sustainable production benefiting communities and their environment. Food sovereignty prioritizes local food production and consumption, giving a country the right to protect its local producers from cheap imports and to control its production. It includes the struggle for land and genuine agrarian reform that ensures that the rights to use and manage lands, territories, water, seeds, livestock, and biodiversity are in the hands of those who produce food and not of the corporate sector." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, when communities, NGOs and the public move beyond the view of food security, i.e. having enough to eat, and transition to the framework of food sovereignty, much more progress can be made in ensuring people's well-being.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Chappell MJ, Wittman H, Bacon CM et al. (2013). Food sovereignty: an alternative paradigm for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in Latin America. ''F1000Research'' 2:235.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers are no longer trapped in debt cycles as a result of constant expenditures on industrial agricultural inputs sold by a few large corporations. Rather they have control over how their food is produced, what is produced, and where it is sold, which must primarily be in local markets. Thus consumers also have close ties to the production process, in addition to always having a dependable source of food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A key component of the agroecological method used to achieve food sovereignty is campesino-a-campesino, or farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange, which is an effective way to strengthen social relations within and between communities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, the collaboration between researchers from universities and farmer research projects allows farmers to have greater social standing than in industrial agriculture where they are simply told what to do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, indigenous customs and knowledge are highly valued, whereas they have historically been considered irrelevant by most agronomists and "development experts".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Through the innovative agroecological techniques that produce a higher and more diverse overall crop yield than industrial agriculture, small-scale farmers are able to be self-sufficient and at the same time produce excess to sell in local "solidarity markets," i.e. places where they have loyal customers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is an effective form of poverty reduction because the greatest cause of poverty in rural Latin America is not having enough income from crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With agroecological methods such as crop diversification, crops are much more resistant to drastic and unexpected effects of climate change, thus farmers' livelihoods are less vulnerable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another important social benefit is the part of agroecology that emphasizes agrarian reform, i.e. transitioning back to small-scale farms where farmers own their land vs. being workers on large, corporate owned industrial farms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Social movements in Brazil such as the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST) have successfully re-acquired land for subsistence farmers and farmer cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fernandes, B.M. (2009). ''The MST and Agrarian Reform in Brazil.'' Socialism and Democracy. 23:3, 90-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of social movements ==
Social movements play a paramount role in the movement of agroecology in Latin America, which emerged in the scene of growing neoliberal globalization beginning in the 1970s. In this period, trans-national corporations began dominating the agricultural sector, causing artificial food shortages, excess dependence on imports and agricultural inputs, and exacerbating existing poverty.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was in response to these effects that many social movements in Latin America formed.

One of the most prominent movements is [[Via Campesina|La Via Campesina]], an umbrella organization that connects many local farmer groups and movements. It began in 1993 when farmer representatives from four continents convened in their first conference, with many representatives from Latin America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it is now present in 73 coutries all over the world, representing around 200 million farmers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; La Via Campesina was the first to define food sovereignty at the World Food Summit in 1996.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It began by demanding land for farmers through occupations, but soon expanded its goals to a much wider range of issues.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Rosset, Peter. (2013). ''Re-thinking agrarian reform, land and territory in La Via Campesina''. The Journal of Peasant Studies. 40:4, 721-775.&lt;/ref&gt; Now its main goals are: defending food sovereignty, struggle for land and agrarian reforms; promoting agroecology and defending local seeds; promoting peasant rights and struggle against criminalization of peasants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has also expanded its work to increasing communication and consensus with other users of land, conducting research, expanding its organizations that deal with legal support for occupations, and confronting negative stereotypes of occupations in the public eye.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They hold an International Conference every four years, which is "the movement’s highest body for political discussion and decision-making, where future actions and agendas are defined." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There have been such conferences since 1993, guiding the many other networks of action that members engage in around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another large movement is the [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra]], or MST in Brazil. MST has been and continues to be one of the largest peasant-lead forces that drive agrarian reform. During the time of Presidents Lula and Cardoso, who prioritized agribusiness, little progress was made.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; But MST’s alliance with La Via Campesina and its fight for agrarian reform explicitly tied to territorial issues still makes it a major driver in these questions: anywhere where there was successful reform, MST—the peasants themselves—were involved. Paradoxically, however, although MST and other organizations are relatively successful in acquiring land, simultaneously large agribusinesses are grabbing pieces of land from the Amazon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In general, there are several trends present in Latin American peasant social movements.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Vergara-Camus, L. (2013) ''Rural Social Movements in Latin America: In the Eye of the Storm.'' Journal of Agrarian Change, Vol. 13 No. 4, pp. 590–606.&lt;/ref&gt; First, peasants have developed a political consciousness and identity even across borders. Second, they share the conviction that small scale agroecological practices actually have higher efficiency, resilience to climate change, and increased food security and sovereignty. Third, they engage in five major battles against [[agribusiness]]es:

* control of nature for sustainable local use
* the right of smallholder farmers to produce for livelihood and communities around them not for profit
* the fight for food sovereignty
* keeping GMO seeds out and allowing their own control of genetic diversity
* making production and market networks sustain the local needs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Role of research ==
Hand in hand with the work of social movements is the work of researchers at various universities throughout Latin America. There are now many agroecology departments throughout the continent, although they often struggle with limited funding and resources compared to large agronomy departments. One example of an organization that promotes agroecological research alongside dialogue with farmers is the [https://www.socla.co/en/ Sociedad Cientifica Latinoamericana de Agroecologia] (SOCLA), or Latin American Scientific Society of Agroecology. SOCLA organizes conferences every year in various locations in Latin America, where farmers, students, and researchers share knowledge, seeds, practices, and formulate strategies for the future.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Examples by method ==

=== Shade Coffee ===
[[Shade-grown coffee]] is an ecologically and economically important agroecosystem in which coffee plants are grown in the understory of a [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]]. The shade of the canopy over the coffee shrubs encourages natural ecological processes and [[species diversity]]. These shade coffee plantations are in many Latin American countries including Brazil, Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Shade coffee growers maintain complex coffee [[Agroforestry|agroforests]] in which they produce coffee and manage the area's [[Biota (ecology)|biota]].

Shade coffee differs from the industrial open sun coffee plantations that increase faster coffee growth and reduce costs but result in decreased biota resources, refuge, [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] and increased broken terrain and soil erosion.&lt;ref name="Franzen,M 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franzen | first1 = M. | last2 = Borgerhoff Mulder | first2 = M. | year = 2007 | title = Ecological, Economic And Social Perspectives On Cocoa Production Worldwide | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-007-9183-5 | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 16| issue = 13| pages = 3835–3849 | doi=10.1007/s10531-007-9183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been done in Latin America to prove the biological importance of shade coffee. In 1996, a scientific journal discussed the evolving industrial coffee plantation effects on Northern Latin American countries. Areas of high deforestation where traditional shade coffee methods are used have been found to be a crucial refuge for many biota. Another study in Veracruz, Mexico on shade coffee ecological relationships found that areas of lower [[cloud forest]] that are now coffee plantations are also a microclimate for native [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[pollinators]].&lt;ref name="Solis-Montero,Lislie 2004"/&gt;[[File:Coffee shadow trees costa rica.jpg|thumb|Coffee shadow trees Costa Rica]]

=== Cabrucas ===
A cabruca is an agroforestry system found in the Latin American countries of Belize, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Franzen,M 2007"/&gt; These cabrucas, largely run by smallholder farmers, are the production locations for cacao trees that grow underneath the canopy of mixed native trees. This forest canopy like the shade coffee has been found to provide a diverse ecosystem. An example of the biological importance of cabrucas can be found in Brazil’s main cacao production region Southern [[Bahia|Bahia, Brazil]]. A 2008 study of biodiversity conservation in cacao regions found that the cabrucas in Southern Bahia are used by a significant amount of native flora and fauna. Due to parts of the region experiencing high deforestation and fragmentation, these cabrucas are providing habitat, fragment connection, and [[Edge effects|edge effect]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassano | first1 = Camila R. | last2 = Schroth | first2 = Götz | last3 = Faria | first3 = Deborah | last4 = Delabie | first4 = Jacques H. C. | last5 = Bede | first5 = Lucio | year = 2008 | title = Landscape and Farm Scale Management to Enhance Biodiversity Conservation in the Cocoa Producing Region of Southern Bahia, Brazil | doi = 10.1007/s10531-008-9526-x | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 577–603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in Costa Rica on the role of these cacao plantations in maintaining [[Bird|avian]] diversity found that the plantations do not substitute for a forest but do provide a home for a large number of avian generalist species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reitsma | first1 = R. | last2 = Parrish | first2 = J. | last3 = McLarney | first3 = W. | year = 2001 | title =  The role of cacao plantations in maintaining forest avian diversity in southeastern Costa Rica | journal = Agroforestry Systems | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 185–193 | doi=10.1023/a:1013328621106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples by country ==

=== Cuba ===
Cuba is an extremely unique example of successful agroecological transformation on a national level. In the beginning of the 20th century, Cuba was devastated socially and ecologically by industrial agro-inputs and chemicals and northern crop dumping, but the socialist revolution did not change that as large-scale industrial agriculture was still prioritized. Thus, once Cuba reached a crisis in the 1990s, it was determined to restructure its food system to emphasize smaller farms, local production, national and local self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Funes-Monzote, F.R., Monzote, M., Lantinga, E.A. Van Keulen, H. (2009). ''Conversion of specialised Dairy Farming Systems into sustainable Mixed Farming Systems in Cuba. Environment, Development and Sustainability.'' 11, 765-783.&lt;/ref&gt; What followed was what is now known as Cuba's agroecological revolution, where small-scale farmers now produce more than 65% domestic food using only 25% of the country's land, most using agroecological methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Its success lies in the dynamic grassroots organization of peasants with other peasants. These improvements in organization and adoption of agroecological methods over time have increased productivity dramatically, and thus also food sovereignty, as well as resilience to climate change.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Rosset, P.M. et al. (2011). ''The Campesino-to-Campesino agroecology movement of ANAP in Cuba: social process methodology in the construction of sustainable peasant agriculture and food sovereignty''. The Journal of Peasant Studies. 38:1, 161–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Animal Research Institute, Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Animal Research Institute, Headquarters.]]
'''Animal Research Institute''' is a research institute in [[Greece]]. It is part of the [[National Agricultural Research Foundation]].

==History==
[[Image:Alfalfa hay collection.jpg|thumb|Alfalfa hay collection.]]
[[Image:Florina (Pelagonia) sheep breed.jpg|thumb|Florina (Pelagonia) sheep breed.]]
[[Image:Chios sheep breed.jpg|thumb|Chios sheep breed.]]
The Animal Research Institute (ARI) was founded in 1952 as a unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and under the name ‘Animal Research Station’. In 1961 it became ‘Institute of Animal Breeding and Nutrition’ and in 1977 it took its present name. ARI has been part of the National Agricultural Research Foundation (N.AG.RE.F.) since 1990 and it is located on 3.5 square kilometres of farmland in Paralimni-[[Giannitsa]], Northern Greece.

==Objective==
The ARI is an institute oriented toward research on general and special zootechnics and includes a specialized scientific staff. The ARI promotes research and technological activities aiming at an integrated approach to deal with rural problems within the framework of national agricultural policy and the agricultural policy of the [[European Union]] (EU). The ARI supports and coordinates initiatives for development suggested by the [[Ministry of Rural Development and Food]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minagric.gr Ministry of Rural Development and Food]&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of universities in Greece|Greek Universities]] and Institutions, the agricultural cooperatives, product distributors, producers’ groups etc.

==Activities==
ARI’s activities cover cross-sectional scientific disciplines related to the animal production with ARI being responsible for their development. ARI is engaged in the research on animal production, especially in the spheres of animal nutrition and physiology, feeding techniques, nutrition and growth, technological systems of farm animal husbandry, genetics and breeding of farm animals, physiology of reproduction (in collaboration with the [[Veterinary Research Institute of Thessaloniki]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vri.gr Veterinary Research Institute of Thessaloniki]&lt;/ref&gt;), ethology of farm animals, improvement in the quality of animal products with respect to food safety and quality in human nutrition.

==Farm, facilities and animals==
Purpose–oriented farming serves as a base for experimental activities. The ARI’s area is 3.5 square kilometres of agricultural land, out of it 3.2&amp;nbsp;km² of arable land with cropping plan focused on preferential provisions of experiments and 0.3&amp;nbsp;km² with facilities for experiments with cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Today in ARI there are farmed cattle and sheep. The average number of animals is as follow: cattle in total 200, out of it 70 dairy cows, 1000 sheep in total, out of it 550 sheep of Chios breed and 450 sheep of Florina (Pelagonia) breed.

'''Applied psychology''' is the use of [[psychological]] methods and findings of scientific psychology to solve practical problems of human and animal behavior and experience. [[Mental health]], [[organizational psychology]], [[business management]], [[education]], [[health]], [[product design]], [[ergonomics]], and [[law]] are just a few of the areas that have been influenced by the application of psychological principles and findings. Some of the areas of applied psychology include [[clinical psychology]], [[counseling psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]], [[legal psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[occupational health psychology]], [[human factors]], [[forensic psychology]], [[engineering psychology]], [[school psychology]], [[sports psychology]], [[traffic psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[medical psychology]]. In addition, a number of specialized areas in the general field of psychology have applied branches (e.g., applied [[social psychology]], applied [[cognitive psychology]]). However, the lines between sub-branch specializations and major applied psychology categories are often blurred. For example, a [[human factor]]s psychologist might use a cognitive psychology theory. This could be described as human factor psychology or as applied cognitive psychology.

== History ==

The founder of applied psychology was [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. He came to America (Harvard) from Germany (Berlin, Laboratory of Stern), invited by William James, and, like many aspiring psychologists during the late 19th century, originally studied philosophy. Münsterberg had many interests in the field of psychology such as purposive psychology, social psychology and forensic psychology. In 1907 he wrote several magazine articles concerning legal aspects of testimony, confessions and courtroom procedures, which eventually developed into his book, ''On the Witness Stand''. The following year the Division of Applied Psychology was adjoined to the Harvard Psychological Laboratory. Within 9 years he had contributed eight books in English, applying psychology to education, industrial efficiency, business and teaching. Eventually Hugo Münsterberg and his contributions would define him as the creator of applied psychology. In 1920, the [[International Association of Applied Psychology]] (IAAP) was founded, as the first international scholarly society within the field of psychology.

Most professional psychologists in the U.S. worked in an academic setting until World War II. But during the war, the armed forces and the [[Office of Strategic Services]] hired psychologists in droves to work on issues such as troop morale and propaganda design.&lt;ref&gt;Cina, "Social Science For Whom?" (1981), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, psychologists found an expanding range of jobs outside of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, ''Fields of Applied Psychology'' (1979), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970, the number of college graduates with degrees in psychology has more than doubled, from 33,679 to 76,671 in 2002. The annual numbers of masters' and PhD degrees have also increased dramatically over the same period. All the while, degrees in the related fields of economics, sociology, and political science have remained constant.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonBerger&gt;Stewart I. Donaldson &amp; Dale E. Berger, "The Rise and Promise of Applied Psychology in the 21st Century", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional organizations have organized special events and meetings to promote the idea of applied psychology. In 1990, the [[American Psychological Society]] held a Behavioral Science Summit and formed the "Human Capital Initiative", spanning schools, workplace productivity, drugs, violence, and community health. The [[American Psychological Association]] declared 2000–2010 the [[Decade of Behavior]], with a similarly broad scope.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonBerger /&gt; Psychological methods are considered applicable to all aspects of human life and society.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo&gt;[[Philip G. Zimbardo]], "Does Psychology Make a Significant Difference in Our Lives?", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
Business advertisers have long consulted psychologists in assessing what types of messages will most effectively induce a person to buy a particular product. Using the psychological research methods and the findings in human's cognition, motivation, attitudes and decision making, those can help to design more persuasive advertisement. Their research includes the study of unconscious influences and brand loyalty.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl&gt;Kathy Pezdek, Kenneth A. Deffenbacher, Shirley Lam, &amp; Robert R. Hoffman, "Cognitive Psychology: Applications and Careers", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect of unconscious influences was controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology and Life|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical psychology==
[[Clinical psychology]] includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[mental health|well-being]] and personal development.&lt;ref name="apa1"&gt;American Psychological Association, Division 12, "[http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html About Clinical Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019125113/http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html |date=2015-10-19 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Central to its practice are [[psychological testing|psychological assessment]] and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]]—this area is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]]. In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health profession]].

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be done inside various therapy models, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. The four major perspectives are [[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral]], [[humanistic psychology|existential-humanistic]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]]. There has been a growing movement to integrate these various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding ethnicity, gender, spirituality, and sexual-orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is growing evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leichsenring | first1 = Falk | last2 = Leibing | first2 = Eric | year = 2003 | title = The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 7| pages = 1223–1233 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 | pmid=12832233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reisner | first1 = Andrew | year = 2005 | title = The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change | url = | journal = The Psychological Record | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 377–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[integrative psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].

Clinical psychologists do not usually [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a growing number of psychologists who do have prescribing privileges, in the field of [[medical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klusman | first1 = Lawrence | year = 2001 | title = Prescribing Psychologists and Patients' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 496–500 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.32.5.496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, when medication is warranted many psychologists will work in cooperation with psychiatrists so that clients get all their therapeutic needs met.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt; Clinical psychologists may also work as part of a team with other professionals, such as [[social work]]ers and [[nutrition]]ists.

==Counseling psychology==
[[Counseling psychology]] is an applied specialization within psychology, that involves both research and practice in a number of different areas or domains. According to Gelso and Fretz (2001), there are some central unifying themes among counseling psychologists. These include a focus on an individual’s strengths, relationships, their educational and career development, as well as a focus on normal personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Gelso, C.J., &amp; Fretz, B. (2001). ''Counseling Psychology'', (2nd ed.): Brooks Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling psychologists help people improve their well-being, reduce and manage stress, and improve overall functioning in their lives. The interventions used by Counseling Psychologists may be either brief or long-term in duration. Often they are problem focused and goal-directed. There is a guiding philosophy which places a value on [[individual differences]] and an emphasis on "prevention, development, and adjustment across the life-span."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div17.org/about/what-is-counseling-psychology/|title=What is Counseling Psychology - Society of Counseling Psychology, Division 17|author=|date=|website=www.div17.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013614/http://www.div17.org/about/what-is-counseling-psychology/|archivedate=2014-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational psychology==
[[Educational psychology]] is devoted to the study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, especially schools. Psychologists assess the effects of specific educational interventions: e.g., [[phonics]] versus [[whole language]] instruction in early reading attainment. They also study the question of why learning occurs differently in different situations.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl /&gt;

Another domain of educational psychology is the psychology of teaching. In some colleges, educational psychology courses are called "the psychology of learning and teaching". Educational psychology derives a great deal from [[basic science (psychology)|basic-science disciplines]] within psychology including [[cognitive science]] and [[behaviorism|behaviorially-oriented]] research on learning.

==Environmental psychology==
[[Environmental psychology]] is the psychological study of humans and their interactions with their environments. The types of environments studied are limitless, ranging from homes, offices, classrooms, factories, nature, and so on. However, across these different environments, there are several common themes of study that emerge within each one. Noise level and ambient temperature are clearly present in all environments and often subjects of discussion for environmental psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = C. A. | year = 1989 | title = Temperature and aggression: Ubiquitous effects of heat on occurrence of human violence | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 74–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowding and stressors are a few other aspects of environments studied by this sub-discipline of psychology.&lt;ref name="Ravizza, K. 2006 pp. 228"/&gt; When examining a particular environment, environmental psychology looks at the goals and purposes of the people in the using the environment, and tries to determine how well the environment is suiting the needs of the people using it. For example, a quiet environment is necessary for a classroom of students taking a test, but would not be needed or expected on a farm full of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = C. S. | year = 1979 | title = The physical environment of the school: A review of the research | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 577–610 | doi=10.3102/00346543049004577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and trends learned through environmental psychology can be used when setting up or rearranging spaces so that the space will best perform its intended function. The top common, more well known areas of psychology that drive this applied field include: cognitive, perception, learning, and social psychology.

==Forensic psychology and legal psychology==
[[Forensic psychology]] and [[legal psychology]] are the area concerned with the application of psychological methods and principles to legal questions and issues. Most typically, forensic psychology involves a clinical analysis of a particular individual and an assessment of some specific psycho-legal question. The psycho-legal question does not have to be criminal in nature. In fact, the forensic psychologist rarely gets involved in the actual criminal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huss | first1 = M. T. | year = 2001 | title = What is forensic psychology? It's not Silence of the Lambs! | url = | journal = Eye on Psi Chi | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 25–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Custody cases are a great example of non-criminal evaluations by forensic psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ackerman | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = M. C. | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.28.2.137 | title = Custody evaluation practices: A survey of experienced professionals (revisited) | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–145 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity and upholding of eyewitness testimony is an area of forensic psychology that does veer closer to criminal investigations, though does not directly involve the psychologist in the investigation process. Psychologists are often called to testify as [[expert witness]]es on issues such as the accuracy of memory, the reliability of police interrogation, and the appropriate course of action in [[child custody]] cases.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

Legal psychology refers to any application of psychological principles, methods or understanding to legal questions or issues. In addition to the applied practices, legal psychology also includes academic or empirical research on topics involving the relationship of law to human mental processes and behavior. However, inherent differences that arise when placing psychology in the legal context.&lt;ref&gt;Ogloff, J. R., and Finkelman, D. (1999). Psychology and law: An overview. In R. Roesch, ed., S. D. Hart, ed., &amp; J. R. P. Ogloff (Eds.), Psychology and law: The state of the discipline (pp. 1–20). New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology rarely makes absolute statements. Instead, psychologists traffic in the terms like level of confidence, percentages, and significance. Legal matters, on the other hand, look for absolutes: guilty or not guilty. This makes for a sticky union between psychology and the legal system. Some universities operate dual JD/PhD programs focusing on the intersection of these two areas.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

The Committee on Legal Issues of the American Psychological Association is known to file ''[[amicus curae]]'' briefs, as applications of psychological knowledge to high-profile court cases.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus&gt;Deborah Davis &amp; Elizabeth F. Loftus, "Psychologists in the Forensic World", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

A related field, [[police psychology]], involves consultation with police departments and participation in police training.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

== Health and medicine ==
[[Health psychology]] concerns itself with understanding how biology, behavior, and social context influence health and illness.&lt;ref&gt;APA, Division 38. ''[http://www.health-psych.org/articles/what_is.php What a Health Psychologist Does and How to Become One] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716132441/http://www.health-psych.org/articles/what_is.php |date=July 16, 2007 }}.'' Retrieved 03-04-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists generally work alongside other medical professionals in clinical settings, although many also teach and conduct research. Although its early beginnings can be traced to the kindred field of [[clinical psychology]], four different approaches to health psychology have been defined: clinical, public health, community and critical health psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M. et al. (2005). "Health Psychology: Theory, Research &amp; Practice." London, England: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|1-4129-0336-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens.  The focus of health psychologists tend to center on the health crisis facing the western world particularly in the US. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[behavior modification]] are techniques often employed by health psychologists. Psychologists also study patients' [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] with their doctors' orders.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

Health psychologists view a person's mental condition as heavily related to their physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, H. S., ed., &amp; Silver, R. C. (Eds.). (2007). Foundations of health psychology. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept in this field is [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], a mental phenomenon with well-known consequences for physical health.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Howard S. Friedman, "Applying Psychology to Promote Health", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===

[[Medical psychology]] involves the application of a range of psychological principles, theories and findings applied to the effective management of physical and mental disorders to improve the psychological and physical health of the patient.  The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) defines medical psychology as the branch of psychology that integrates somatic and psychotherapeutic modalities, into the management of mental illness, health rehabilitation and emotional, cognitive, behavioural and substance use disorders. According to Muse and Moore (2012), the medical psychologist's contributions in the areas of [[psychopharmacology]] which sets it apart from other  of psychotherapy and psychotherpists.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, B. &amp; Muse, M. (2012). Handbook of Clinical Psychopharmacology for Psychologists. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Occupational health psychology ===

[[Occupational health psychology]] (OHP) is a relatively new discipline that emerged from the confluence of health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and [[occupational safety and health|occupational health]].&lt;ref&gt;Everly, G.S., Jr. (1986). An introduction to occupational health psychology. In P.A. Keller &amp; L.G. Ritt (Eds.), ''Innovations in clinical practice: A source book, Vol. 5'' (pp. 331–338). Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP has its own journals and professional organizations. The field is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that give rise to health-related problems in people who work. These problems can involve physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosma | first1 = H. | last2 = Marmot | first2 = M.G. | last3 = Hemingway | first3 = H. | last4 = Nicholson | first4 = A.C. | last5 = Brunner | first5 = E. | last6 = Stansfeld | first6 = S.A. | year = 1997 | title = Low job control and risk of coronary heart disease in Whitehall II (prospective cohort) study | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 314 | issue = | pages = 558–565 | doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7080.558}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or mental health (e.g., depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tucker | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = J.L. | year = 2005 | title = The multilevel effects of occupational stressors on soldiers' well-being: Organizational attachment, and readiness | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 276–299 | doi=10.1037/1076-8998.10.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Human factors and ergonomics==
[[Human factors and ergonomics]] (HF&amp;E) is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools, machines, and objects in the environment. Many branches of psychology attempt to create models of and understand human behavior. These models are usually based on data collected from experiments. Human Factor psychologists however, take the same data and use it to design or adapt processes and objects that will compliment the human component of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Meister, D. (1999). The history of human factors and ergonomics. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than humans learning how to use and manipulate a piece of technology, human factors strives to design technology to be inline with the human behavior models designed by general psychology. This could be accounting for physical limitations of humans, as in ergonomics, or designing systems, especially computer systems, that work intuitively with humans, as does engineering psychology.

Ergonomics is applied primarily through office work and the transportation industry. Psychologists here take into account the physical limitations of the human body and attempt to reduce fatigue and stress by designing products and systems that work within the natural limitations of the human body. From simple things like the size of buttons and design of office chairs to layout of airplane cockpits, human factor psychologists, specializing in ergonomics, attempt to de-stress our everyday lives and sometimes even save them.

Human factor psychologists specializing in [[engineering psychology]] tend to take on slightly different projects than their ergonomic centered counterparts. These psychologists look at how a human and a process interact.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, S. N. (1997). The adolescence of engineering psychology. In S. M. Casey (Series Ed.), Human factors history monograph series (Vol. 1). Santa Monica, CA: Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Often engineering psychology may be centered on computers. However at the base level, a process is simply a series of inputs and outputs between a human and a machine. The human must have a clear method to input data and be able to easily access the information in output. The inability of rapid and accurate corrections can sometimes lead to drastic consequences, as summed up by many stories in Set Phasers on Stun.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, S.M. (1998). Set Phasers on Stun: And Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering psychologists wants to make the process of inputs and outputs as intuitive as possible for the user.

The goal of research in human factors is to understand the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior, and design items and systems that will interact accordingly with the limitations. Some may see human factors as intuitive or a list of dos and don'ts, but in reality, human factor research strives to find the make sense of large piles of data to bring precise applications to product designs and systems to help people work more naturally, intuitively with the items of their surroundings.

==Industrial and organizational psychology==
[[Industrial and organizational psychology]], or I-O psychology, focuses on the psychology of the workforce, customer, and consumer, including issues such as the psychology of recruitment, selecting employees from an applicant pool, training, [[performance appraisal]], [[job satisfaction]], [[work motivation]]. [[work behavior]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]] at work and [[management]]. In short, I-O psychology is the application of psychology to the workplace. A core aspect of this field is [[job analysis]], the detailed study of which behaviors a given job entails.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, ''Fields of Applied Psychology'' (1979), pp. 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the name of the title "Industrial Organizational Psychology" implies 2 split disciplines being chained together, it is near impossible to have one half without the other. If asked to generally define the differences, Industrial psychology focuses more on the [[Human Resources]] aspects of the field, and Organizational psychology focuses more on the personal interactions of the employees. When applying these principles however, they are not easily broken apart. For example, when developing requirements for a new job position, the recruiters are looking for an applicant with strong communication skills in multiple areas. The developing of the position requirements falls under the industrial psychology, human resource type work. and the requirement of communication skills is related to how the employee with interacts with co-workers. As seen here, it is hard to separate task of developing a qualifications list from the types of qualifications on the list. This is parallel to how the I and O are nearly inseparable in practice. Therefore, I-O psychologists are generally rounded in both industrial and organizational psychology though they will have some specialization. Other topics of interest for I-O psychologists include performance evaluation, training, and much more.

[[Military psychology]] includes research into the classification, training, and performance of soldiers.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl /&gt;

==School psychology==
[[School psychology]] is a field that applies principles of [[clinical psychology]] and [[educational psychology]] to the diagnosis and treatment of students' behavioral and learning problems. School psychologists are educated in [[child development|child and adolescent development]], [[learning]] theories, psychological and psycho-educational [[Psychological assessment|assessment]], [[personality psychology|personality theories]], therapeutic interventions, special education, psychology, consultation, child and adolescent psychopathology, and the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession.

According to Division 16 (Division of School Psychology) of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), school psychologists operate according to a scientific framework. They work to promote effectiveness and efficiency in the field. School psychologists conduct psychological assessments, provide brief interventions, and develop or help develop prevention programs. Additionally, they evaluate services with special focus on developmental processes of children within the school system, and other systems, such as families. School psychologists consult with [[teacher]]s, parents, and school personnel about learning, behavioral, social, and emotional problems. They may teach lessons on parenting skills (like school counselors), learning strategies, and other skills related to school [[mental health]]. In addition, they explain test results to parents and students. They provide individual, group, and in some cases family counseling (State Board of Education 2003; National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education, n.d.). School psychologists are actively involved in district and school crisis intervention teams. They also supervise graduate students in school psychology. School psychologists in many districts provide professional development to teachers and other school personnel on topics such as positive behavior intervention plans and achievement tests.

One salient application for school psychology in today's world is responding to the unique challenges of increasingly multicultural classrooms. For example, psychologists can contribute insight about the differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Greenfield, "Applying Developmental Psychology to Bridge Cultures in the Classroom", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

School psychologists are influential within the school system and are frequently consulted to solve problems. Practitioners should be able to provide consultation and collaborate with other members of the educational community and confidently make decisions based on empirical research.

== Social change ==
Psychologists have been employed to promote "green" behavior, i.e. [[sustainable development]]. In this case, their goal is [[behavior modification]], through strategies such as [[social marketing]]. Tactics include education, disseminating information, organizing social movements, passing laws, and altering taxes to influence decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Oskamp &amp; P. Wesley Schultz, "Using Psychological Science to Achieve Ecological Sustainability", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology has been applied on a world scale with the aim of [[population control]]. For example, one strategy towards television programming combines social models in a soap opera with informational messages during advertising time. This strategy successfully increased women's enrollment at family planning clinics in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo /&gt; The programming—which has been deployed around the world by Population Communications International and the Population Media Center—combines family planning messages with representations of female education and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Bandura]], "Going Global With Social Cognitive Theory: From Prospect to Paydirt", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport psychology==
[[Sport psychology]] is a specialization within [[psychology]] that seeks to understand psychological/mental factors that affect [[performance]] in [[sport]]s, [[physical activity]] and [[exercise]] and apply these to enhance individual and [[team]] performance. The sport psychology approach differs from the coaches and players perspective.&lt;ref name="Ravizza, K. 2006 pp. 228"&gt;Ravizza, K. (2006). Increasing awareness for sport performance. In J. M. Williams (Ed.), Applied sport psychology (pp. 228–239). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches tend to narrow their focus and energy towards the end-goal. They are concerned with the actions that lead to the win, as opposed to the sport psychologist who tries to focus the players thoughts on just achieving the win. Sport psychology trains players mentally to prepare them, whereas coaches tend to focus mostly on physical training. Sport psychology deals with increasing performance by managing emotions and minimizing the psychological effects of injury and poor performance. Some of the most important skills taught are goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk awareness and control, concentration, using rituals, attribution training, and periodization. The principles and theories may be applied to any human movement or performance tasks (e.g., playing a musical instrument, acting in a play, public speaking, motor skills). Usually, experts recommend that students be trained in both [[kinesiology]] (i.e., sport and exercise sciences, [[physical education]]) and [[psychotherapy|counseling]].

==Traffic psychology==
[[Traffic psychology]] is an applied discipline within psychology that looks at the relationship between psychological processes and cognitions and the actual behavior of road users. In general, traffic psychologists attempt to apply these principles and research findings, in order to provide solutions to problems such as traffic mobility and congestion, road accidents, speeding. Research psychologists also are involved with the education and the motivation of road users.&lt;ref name=Rothengatter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothengatter|first=T.|title=Psychological aspects of road user behavior.|journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review|year=1997|volume=46|issue=3|pages=223–234|doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01227.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenbeld|first=C.|author2=Levelt, P.B.M.|author3=Heidstra, J.|title=Psychological perspectives on changing driver attitude and behaviour.|journal=recherche-Transports-Securite|year=2000|volume=67|pages=65–81|doi=10.1016/s0761-8980(00)90108-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora generator starting to smoke.png|thumbnail|right|The diesel generator used in the aurora experiment beginning to smoke.]]

[[Idaho National Laboratory]] ran the '''Aurora Generator Test''' in 2007 to demonstrate how a [[cyberattack]] could destroy physical components of the electric grid.&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; The experiment used a computer program to rapidly open and close a [[diesel generator]]'s circuit breakers out of phase from the rest of the grid and cause it to explode. This vulnerability is referred to as the ''Aurora Vulnerability''.

This vulnerability is especially a concern because much grid equipment supports using [[Modbus]] and other legacy [[communications protocol]]s that were designed without security in mind. As such, they don't support [[authentication]], [[confidentiality]], or [[Replay attack|replay protection]], which means any attacker that can communicate with the device can control it and use the Aurora Vulnerability to destroy it. This is a serious concern, as the failure of even a single generator could cause widespread outages and possibly [[cascading failure]] of the entire power grid, like what occurred in the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]]. Additionally, even if there are no outages from the removal of a single component (N-1 resilience), there is a large window for a second attack or failure, as it could take more than a year to replace it, because many generators and transformers are custom-built for the substation.

The Aurora vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers. Some suggested methods include adding functionality in [[Protective relay|protective relays]] to ensure synchronism and adding a time delay for closing breakers.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt; Most modern day generators have many protections against out-of-sync generator breaker operations. Devices such as the IEEE 25 Sync Check relay as well as IEEE 46,47,50, and 53 are commonly used to prevent out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers from ever happening. In addition the majority of the generator relays used do not have any type of communication they inhibit generator breaker operation by not allowing breaker close circuit from operating.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Experiment ==
To prepare for the experiment, the researchers procured and installed a 2.25 MW generator and connected it to the substation. They also needed access to a programmable digital relay or another device that controls the breaker. That access could have been through a mechanical or digital interface.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 91"/&gt;

In the experiment, the researchers used a cyberattack to open and close the breakers out of sync, to maximize the stress. Each time the breakers were closed, the torque from the synchronization caused the generator to bounce and shake, eventually causing parts of the generator be to ripped apart and sent flying off.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; Some parts of the generator landed as far as 80 feet away from the generator.&lt;ref name="International Spy Museum, Master Script"/&gt;

The unit was destroyed in roughly three minutes. However, this was only because the researchers assessed the damage from each iteration of the attack. A real attack could have destroyed the unit much more quickly.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

The experiment was designated as unclassified, [[For Official Use Only|for official use only]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 134"/&gt; On September 27, 2007, CNN published an article based on the information and video DHS released to them,&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; and on July 3, 2014, DHS released many of the documents related to the experiment as part of an unrelated FOIA request.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA request"/&gt;

== Vulnerability ==
The Aurora vulnerability is caused by bypassing the [[Protective relay|protective relays]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; This would require knowledge of the switchgear for that particular plant and then access to that gear and then physical jumpers placed to enable this to happen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Proper security of electrical switchgear rooms will prevent this from happening. While certainly plausible this would be highly unlikely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

"A close, but imperfect, analogy would be to imagine the effect of shifting a car into Reverse while it is being driven on a highway, or the effect of revving the engine up while the car is in neutral and then shifting it into Drive."&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

"The Aurora attack is designed to open a circuit breaker, wait for the system or generator to slip out of synchronism, and reclose the breaker, all before the protection system recognizes and responds to the attack... Traditional generator protection elements typically actuate and block reclosing in about 15 cycles. Many variables affect this time, and every system needs to be analyzed to determine its specific vulnerability to the Aurora attack... Although the main focus of the Aurora attack is the potential 15-cycle window of opportunity immediately after the target breaker is opened, the overriding issue is how fast the generator moves away from system synchronism."&lt;ref name="Common Questions and Answers"/&gt;

== Mitigations ==

The Aurora vulnerability is caused by the out-of-sync closing of the protective relays. As such, any mechanism that prevents the out-of-sync closing would mitigate the vulnerability.

One mitigation technique is to add a synchronism-check function to all protective relays that potentially connect two systems together. To implement this, the function must prevent the relay from closing unless the voltage and frequency are within a pre-set range. Additionally, the synchronism-check could monitor the rate of change of the frequency and prevent closing above a set rate.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

There was some discussion as to whether Aurora hardware mitigation devices (HMD) can cause other failures. In May 2011, Quanta Technology published an article that used [[Real Time Digital Simulator|RTDS (Real Time Digital Simulator)]] testing to examine the "performance of multiple commercial relay devices available" of Aurora HMDs. To quote: "The relays were subject to different test categories to find out if their performance is dependable when they need to operate, and secure in response to typical power system transients such as faults, power swing and load switching... In general, there were technical shortcomings in the protection scheme’s design that were identified and documented using the real time testing results. RTDS testing showed that there is, as yet, no single solution that can be widely applied to any case, and that can present the required reliability level."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 2, Spring 2011"/&gt; A presentation from Quanta Technology and [[Dominion Resources|Dominion]] succinctly stated in their reliability assessment "HMDs are not dependable, nor secure."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology and Dominion July 2011 presentation"/&gt;

Joe Weiss, a cybersecurity and control system professional, disputed the findings from this report and claimed that it has misled utilities. He wrote: "This report has done a great deal of damage by implying that the Aurora mitigation devices will cause grid issues. Several utilities have used the Quanta report as a basis for not installing any Aurora mitigation devices. Unfortunately, the report has several very questionable assumptions. They include applying initial conditions that the hardware mitigation was not designed to address such as slower developing faults, or off nominal grid frequencies. Existing protection will address “slower” developing faults and off nominal grid frequencies (&lt;59 Hz or &gt;61 Hz). The Aurora hardware mitigation devices are for the very fast out-of-phase condition faults that are currently gaps in protection (i.e., not protected by any other device) of the grid."&lt;ref name="Unfettered Blog, September 4, 2013"/&gt;

[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. The black-body radiation graph is also compared with the classical model of Rayleigh and Jeans.]]

[[Image:PlanckianLocus.png|thumb|303px|The color ([[chromaticity]]) of black-body radiation depends on the temperature of the black body; the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of such colors, shown here in [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 ''x,y'' space]], is known as the [[Planckian locus]].]]

'''Black-body radiation''' is the [[thermal radiation|thermal]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] within or surrounding a body in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its environment, or emitted by a [[black body]] (an opaque and non-reflective body).  It has a specific spectrum and intensity that depends only on the body's temperature, which is assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Landsberg&gt;{{harvnb|Landsberg|1990}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as black-body radiation.  A perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains black-body radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall, provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium.

A black-body at room temperature appears black, as most of the energy it radiates is [[infra-red]] and cannot be perceived by the human eye. Because the human eye cannot perceive light waves at lower frequencies, a black body, viewed in the dark at the lowest just faintly visible temperature, subjectively appears grey, even though its objective physical spectrum peak is in the infrared range.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; When it becomes a little hotter, it appears dull red. As its temperature increases further it becomes yellow, white, and ultimately blue-white.

Although planets and stars are neither in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings nor perfect [[black body|black bodies]], black-body radiation is used as a first approximation for the energy they emit.&lt;ref name=Morison&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Astronomy and Cosmology |author=Ian Morison |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrV8vvJzgWkC&amp;pg=PA48 |page=48 |isbn=0-470-03333-9 |year=2008 |publisher=J Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black holes]] are near-perfect black bodies, in the sense that they absorb all the radiation that falls on them. It has been proposed that they emit black-body radiation (called [[Hawking radiation]]), with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole.&lt;ref name=Fabbri&gt;{{cite book |title=Modeling black hole evaporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUhZZtb6yA8C&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |author1=Alessandro Fabbri |author2=José Navarro-Salas |isbn=1-86094-527-9 |year=2005 |publisher=Imperial College Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black body'' was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;From (Kirchhoff, 1860) (''Annalen der Physik und Chemie''), p. 277:  ''"Der Beweis, welcher für die ausgesprochene Behauptung hier gegeben werden soll, … ''vollkommen schwarze'', oder kürzer ''schwarze'', nennen."''  (The proof, which shall be given here for the proposition stated [above], rests on the assumption that bodies are conceivable which in the case of infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all rays that fall on them, thus [they] neither reflect nor transmit rays.  I will call such bodies "completely black [bodies]" or more briefly "black [bodies]".)  See also (Kirchhoff, 1860) (''Philosophical Magazine''), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Black-body radiation is also called [[thermal radiation]], ''cavity radiation'', ''complete radiation'' or ''temperature radiation''.

==Spectrum==
Black-body radiation has a characteristic, continuous [[spectral energy distribution|frequency spectrum]] that depends only on the body's temperature,&lt;ref name=Kogure&gt;

{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt5sueHmtR4C&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41 |chapter=§2.3: Thermodynamic equilibrium and black-body radiation |title=The astrophysics of emission-line stars |author1=Tomokazu Kogure |author2=Kam-Ching Leung |isbn=0-387-34500-0 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  called the Planck spectrum or [[Planck's law]].  The spectrum is peaked at a characteristic frequency that shifts to higher frequencies with increasing temperature, and at [[room temperature]] most of the emission is in the [[infrared]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Wien, W. (1893). Eine neue Beziehung der Strahlung schwarzer Körper zum zweiten Hauptsatz der Wärmetheorie, ''Sitzungberichte der Königlich-Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften '' (Berlin), 1893, '''1''': 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lummer, O., Pringsheim, E. (1899). Die Vertheilung der Energie im Spectrum des schwarzen Körpers, ''Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gessellschaft'' (Leipzig), 1899, '''1''': 23–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 1914"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the temperature increases past about 500 degrees [[Celsius]], black bodies start to emit significant amounts of visible light. Viewed in the dark by the human eye, the first faint glow appears as a "ghostly" grey (the visible light is actually red, but low intensity light activates only the eye's grey-level sensors). With rising temperature, the glow becomes visible even when there is some background surrounding light: first as a dull red, then yellow, and eventually a "dazzling bluish-white" as the temperature rises.&lt;ref&gt;[[John William Draper|Draper, J.W.]] (1847). On the production of light by heat, ''London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', series 3, '''30''': 345–360.

The Sun, with an [[effective temperature]] of approximately 5800 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=482, 484}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the [[visible spectrum]], but with significant power in the ultraviolet as well.

Black-body radiation provides insight into the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] state of cavity radiation. If each [[Fourier mode]] of the equilibrium radiation in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode.  Since there are an infinite number of modes this implies infinite [[heat capacity]] (infinite energy at any non-zero temperature), as well as an unphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].  Instead, in quantum theory the [[quantum field theory|occupation numbers]] of the modes are quantized, cutting off the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe.  The study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of [[history of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]].

[[Image:Color temperature black body 800-12200K.svg|thumb|512px|Color of a black body from 800 K to 12200 K. This range of colors approximates the range of colors of stars of different temperatures, as seen or photographed in the night sky.]]

All normal ([[baryon]]ic) matter emits electromagnetic radiation when it has a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. The radiation represents a conversion of a body's internal energy into electromagnetic energy, and is therefore called [[thermal radiation]]. It is a [[spontaneous process]] of radiative distribution of [[entropy]].

Conversely all normal matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree. An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all [[wavelength]]s, is called a black body. When a black body is at a uniform temperature, its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature. Its emission is called black-body radiation.

The concept of the black body is an idealization, as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graphite]] and [[carbon black|lamp black]], with emissivities greater than 0.95, however, are good approximations to a black material. Experimentally, black-body radiation may be established best as the ultimately stable steady state equilibrium radiation in a cavity in a rigid body, at a uniform temperature, that is entirely opaque and is only partly reflective.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt;  A closed box of graphite walls at a constant temperature with a small hole on one side produces a good approximation to ideal black-body radiation emanating from the opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wien|1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black-body radiation has the unique absolutely stable distribution of radiative intensity that can persist in thermodynamic equilibrium in a cavity.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt; In equilibrium, for each frequency the total intensity of radiation that is emitted and reflected from a body (that is, the net amount of radiation leaving its surface, called the ''spectral radiance'') is determined solely by the equilibrium temperature, and does not depend upon the shape, material or structure of the body.&lt;ref name=Caniou&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-aFGcf6pOEC&amp;pg=PA107 |page=107 |chapter=§4.2.2: Calculation of Planck's law |title=Passive infrared detection: theory and applications |author=Joseph Caniou |isbn=0-7923-8532-2 |year=1999 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a black body (a perfect absorber) there is no reflected radiation, and so the spectral radiance is entirely due to emission.  In addition, a black body is a diffuse emitter (its emission is independent of direction). Consequently, black-body radiation may be viewed as the radiation from a black body at thermal equilibrium.

Black-body radiation becomes a visible glow of light if the temperature of the object is high enough. The [[Draper point]] is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red, about {{val|798|u=K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{val|1000|u=K}}, a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity (let us call it an oven), viewed from outside, looks red; at {{val|6000|u=K}}, it looks white. No matter how the oven is constructed, or of what material, as long as it is built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls, it will contain a good approximation to black-body radiation.  The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the ''black-body curve''. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.

Two bodies that are at the same temperature stay in mutual thermal equilibrium, so a body at temperature ''T'' surrounded by a cloud of light at temperature ''T'' on average will emit as much light into the cloud as it absorbs, following Prevost's exchange principle, which refers to [[radiative equilibrium]]. The principle of [[detailed balance]] says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, SR., Mazur, P. (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Section 9.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state. The causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic (spontaneous) emission is not direct, but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body. This means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body at temperature ''T'', black or not, is equal to the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light at temperature ''T''.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"/&gt;

When the body is black, the absorption is obvious: the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface. For a black body much bigger than the wavelength, the light energy absorbed at any wavelength ''λ'' per unit time is strictly proportional to the black-body curve. This means that the black-body curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body, which justifies the name. This is the  condition for the applicability of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]: the black-body curve is characteristic of thermal light, which depends only on the [[temperature]] of the walls of the cavity, provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective, and that the cavity is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Kerson|title=Statistical Mechanics |year=1967 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=0-471-81518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the black body is small, so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light, the absorption is modified, because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In the laboratory, black-body radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity, a [[hohlraum]], in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective, that is maintained at a constant temperature. (This technique leads to the alternative term ''cavity radiation''.) Any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped, in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed. Absorption occurs regardless of the [[wavelength]] of the radiation entering (as long as it is small compared to the hole). The hole, then, is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and, if the cavity is heated, the [[Power spectral density|spectrum]] of the hole's radiation (i.e., the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength) will be continuous, and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive, but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity (compare with [[emission spectrum]]).

Calculating the black-body curve was a major challenge in [[theoretical physics]] during the late nineteenth century. The problem was solved in 1901 by [[Max Planck]] in the formalism now known as [[Planck's law]] of black-body radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making changes to [[Wien's radiation law]] (not to be confused with [[Wien's displacement law]]) consistent with [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]], he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily. Planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized, i.e., it existed in integer multiples of some quantity. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the [[photoelectric effect]]. These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by [[quantum electrodynamics]]. These quanta were called [[photon]]s and the black-body cavity was thought of as containing a [[photon gas|gas of photons]]. In addition, it led to the development of quantum probability distributions, called [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], each applicable to a different class of particles, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.

The wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by Wien's displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet, enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue. It will never become invisible—indeed, the radiation of visible light increases [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with temperature.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{cite book |last=Landau |first=L. D.|author2=E. M. Lifshitz|title=Statistical Physics |edition=3rd Edition Part 1 |year=1996|publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann |location=Oxford |isbn=0-521-65314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stefan–Boltzmann law also says that the total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its [[absolute temperature]]. The law was formulated by Josef Stefan in 1879 and later derived by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''σT''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given, where ''E'' is the radiant heat emitted from a unit of area per unit time, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, and {{nowrap|1=''σ'' = {{val|5.670367|e=-8|u=W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]] .&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/Stefan-Boltzmann-law&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[radiance]] or observed intensity is not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian]] radiator.

Real objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be. The [[emissivity]] of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the ''gray body'' assumption.

With non-black surfaces, the deviations from ideal black-body behavior are determined by both the surface structure, such as roughness or granularity, and the chemical composition. On a "per wavelength" basis, real objects in states of [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] still follow [[Kirchhoff's law (thermodynamics)|Kirchhoff's Law]]: emissivity equals absorptivity, so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body; the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body.

In [[astronomy]], objects such as [[star]]s are frequently regarded as black bodies, though this is often a poor approximation. An almost perfect black-body spectrum is exhibited by the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. [[Hawking radiation]] is the hypothetical black-body radiation emitted by [[black hole]]s, at a temperature that depends on the mass, charge, and spin of the hole.  If this prediction is correct, black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles.

A black body radiates energy at all frequencies, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature ({{val|300|u=K}}) with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390–750&amp;nbsp;nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Planck's law of black-body radiation===

{{Main article|Planck's law}}

Planck's law states that&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(\nu, T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:B''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') is the spectral radiance (the [[Power (physics)|power]] per unit [[solid angle]] and per unit of area normal to the propagation) density of frequency ''ν'' radiation per unit [[frequency]] at thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T.''
:''h'' is the [[Planck constant]];
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum;
:''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]];
:''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic radiation;
:''T'' is the absolute [[temperature]] of the body.
For a black body surface the spectral radiance density (defined per unit of area normal to the propagation) is independent of the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of emission with respect to the normal. However, this means that, following [[Lambert's cosine law]], &lt;math&gt; B_\nu(T) \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the radiance density per unit area of emitting surface as the surface area involved in generating the radiance is increased by a factor &lt;math&gt; 1/\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an area normal to the propagation direction. At oblique angles, the solid angle spans involved do get smaller, resulting in lower aggregate intensities.

===Wien's displacement law===

[[Wien's displacement law]] shows how the spectrum of black-body radiation at any temperature is related to the spectrum at any other temperature. If we know the shape of the spectrum at one temperature, we can calculate the shape at any other temperature. Spectral intensity can be expressed as a function of wavelength or of frequency.

A consequence of Wien's displacement law is that the wavelength at which the intensity ''per unit wavelength'' of the radiation produced by a black body is at a maximum, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\max&lt;/math&gt;, is a function only of the temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\max = \frac{b}{T},&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant ''b'', known as Wien's displacement constant, is equal to {{val|2.8977729|(17)|e=-3|u=K m}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bwien&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck's law was also stated above as a function of frequency. The intensity maximum for this is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_\max = T \times 1.04 \times 10^{11} \ \mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{K}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stefan–Boltzmann law===
By integrating &lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T)&lt;/math&gt; over the frequency the integrated radiance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; L=\frac{2\pi^5}{15} \frac{k^4 T^4}{c^2h^3} \frac{1}{\pi}=:\sigma T^4 \frac{1}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

by using &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty dx\, \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1}=\frac{\pi^4}{15}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \equiv \frac{h\nu}{k T} &lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\sigma \equiv \frac{2\pi^5}{15} \frac{k^4}{c^2h^3}=5.670373 \times 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2 K^4}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]. The radiance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma T^4 \frac{\cos \theta}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
per unit of emitting surface.

On a side note, at a distance d, the intensity &lt;math&gt;dI&lt;/math&gt; per area &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; of radiating surface is the useful expression
:&lt;math&gt; dI=\sigma T^4 \frac{\cos\theta}{\pi d^2}dA&lt;/math&gt;
when the receiving surface is perpendicular to the radiation.

By subsequently integrating over the solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;) the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] is calculated, stating that the power ''j''* emitted per unit area of the surface of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;j^\star = \sigma T^4,&lt;/math&gt;
by using
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos\theta\, d\Omega = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2}  \cos\theta\sin\theta \,d\theta\,d\phi= \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The human body radiates energy as [[infrared]] light. The net power radiated is the difference between the power emitted and the power absorbed:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = P_\text{emit} - P_\text{absorb}.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = A \sigma \varepsilon \left( T^4 - T_0^4 \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''T'' are the body surface area and temperature, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[emissivity]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ambient temperature.

The total surface area of an adult is about 2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the mid- and far-infrared [[emissivity]] of skin and most clothing is near unity, as it is for most nonmetallic surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = 100~\text{W}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total energy radiated in one day is about 8 [[megajoule|MJ]], or 2000 kcal (food [[calorie]]s).

However, the mean metabolic rate of sedentary adults is about 50% to 70% greater than their basal rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levine, J|title=Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): environment and biology|journal=Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab|volume=286|year=2004|pages=E675–E685|url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/286/5/E675|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00562.2003|pmid=15102614|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other important thermal loss mechanisms, including [[convection]] and [[evaporation]]. Conduction is negligible – the [[Nusselt number]] is much greater than unity. Evaporation by [[perspiration]] is only required if radiation and convection are insufficient to maintain a steady-state temperature (but evaporation from the lungs occurs regardless). Free-convection rates are comparable, albeit somewhat lower, than radiative rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=DrPhysics.com
| title=Heat Transfer and the Human Body
| url=http://www.drphysics.com/convection/convection.html
| accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, radiation accounts for about two-thirds of thermal energy loss in cool, still air. Given the approximate nature of many of the assumptions, this can only be taken as a crude estimate. Ambient air motion, causing forced convection, or evaporation reduces the relative importance of radiation as a thermal-loss mechanism.

Application of [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's law]] to human-body emission results in a peak wavelength of
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{peak} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}~\text{K} \cdot \text{m}}{305~\text{K}} = 9.50~\mu\text{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
For this reason, thermal imaging devices for human subjects are most sensitive in the 7–14 micrometer range.

==Temperature relation between a planet and its star==
{{main|Planetary equilibrium temperature}}

The black-body law may be used to estimate the temperature of a planet orbiting the Sun.

[[Image:Erbe.gif|thumb|300px|Earth's longwave thermal [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|radiation]] intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and ground]]
The temperature of a planet depends on several factors:
*Incident radiation from its star
*Emitted radiation of the planet, e.g., [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Earth's infrared glow]]
*The [[albedo]] effect causing a fraction of light to be reflected by the planet
*The [[greenhouse effect]] for planets with an atmosphere
*Energy generated internally by a planet itself due to [[radioactive decay]], [[tidal heating]], and [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|adiabatic contraction due by cooling]].

The analysis only considers the Sun's heat for a planet in a Solar System.

The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] gives the total [[power (physics)|power]] (energy/second) the Sun is emitting:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm S\ emt} = 4 \pi R_{\rm S}^2 \sigma T_{\rm S}^4 \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm S} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the effective temperature of the Sun, and
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm S} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Sun.

The Sun emits that power equally in all directions. Because of this, the planet is hit with only a tiny fraction of it. The power from the Sun that strikes the planet (at the top of the atmosphere) is:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm SE} = P_{\rm S\ emt} \left( \frac{\pi R_{\rm E}^2}{4 \pi D^2} \right) \qquad \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm E} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the planet and
:&lt;math&gt;D \,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the [[Sun]] and the planet.

Because of its high temperature, the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) frequency range. In this frequency range, the planet reflects a fraction &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of this energy where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[albedo]] or reflectance of the planet in the UV-Vis range. In other words, the planet absorbs a fraction &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the Sun's light, and reflects the rest. The power absorbed by the planet and its atmosphere is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = (1-\alpha)\,P_{\rm SE} \qquad \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Even though the planet only absorbs as a circular area &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2&lt;/math&gt;, it emits equally in all directions as a sphere. If the planet were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm emt\,bb} = 4 \pi R_{\rm E}^2 \sigma T_{\rm E}^4 \qquad \qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm E} &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the planet.  This temperature, calculated for the case of the planet acting as a black body by setting &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = P_{\rm emt\,bb}&lt;/math&gt;, is known as the [[effective temperature]].  The actual temperature of the planet will likely be different, depending on its surface and atmospheric properties. Ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse effect, the planet, since it is at a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits mostly in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum. In this frequency range, it emits &lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; of the radiation that a black body would emit where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the average emissivity in the IR range. The power emitted by the planet is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm emt} = \overline{\epsilon}\,P_{\rm emt\,bb} \qquad \qquad (5)&lt;/math&gt;

For a body in [[Radiative equilibrium#Definitions of radiative equilbrium#radiative exchange equilibrium|radiative exchange equilibrium]] with its surroundings, the rate at which it emits radiant energy is equal to the rate at which it absorbs it:&lt;ref name="Prevost 1791"&gt;Prevost, P. (1791). Mémoire sur l'equilibre du feu. ''Journal de Physique'' (Paris), vol 38 pp. 314-322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iribarne, J.V., Godson, W.L. (1981). ''Atmospheric Thermodynamics'', second edition, D. Reidel Publishing, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|90-277-1296-4}}, page 227.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs}=P_{\rm emt} \qquad \qquad (6)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the expressions for solar and planet power in equations 1–6 and simplifying yields the estimated temperature of the planet, ignoring greenhouse effect, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;T_P = T_S\sqrt{\frac{R_S\sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{\overline{\varepsilon}}}}{2D}} \qquad \qquad (7) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, given the assumptions made, the temperature of a planet depends only on the surface temperature of the Sun, the radius of the Sun, the distance between the planet and the Sun, the albedo and the IR emissivity of the planet.

Notice that a gray (flat spectrum) ball where &lt;math&gt; ({1-\alpha}) ={\overline{\varepsilon}} &lt;/math&gt; comes to the same temperature as a black body no matter how dark or light gray .

===Effective temperature of Earth===

Substituting the measured values for the Sun and Earth yields:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm S} = 5778 \ \mathrm{K},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html NASA Sun Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the average emissivity &lt;math&gt; \overline{\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt; set to unity, the [[effective temperature]] of the Earth is:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm E} = 254.356\  \mathrm{K}&lt;/math&gt;
or −18.8&amp;nbsp;°C.

This is the temperature of the Earth if it radiated as a perfect black body in the infrared, assuming an unchanging albedo and ignoring [[greenhouse effect]]s (which can raise the surface temperature of a body above what it would be if it were a perfect black body in all spectrums&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Planetary Climate'' by Raymond T. Peirrehumbert, Cambridge University Press (2011), p. 146.

The Earth in fact radiates not quite as a perfect black body in the infrared which will raise the estimated temperature a few degrees above the effective temperature. If we wish to estimate what the temperature of the Earth would be if it had no atmosphere, then we could take the albedo and emissivity of the Moon as a good estimate. The albedo and emissivity of the Moon are about 0.1054&lt;ref name="Saari"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saari |first1=J. M. |last2=Shorthill |first2= R. W.|year=1972 |title=The Sunlit Lunar Surface. I.

Estimates of the Earth's average albedo vary in the range 0.3–0.4, resulting in different estimated effective temperatures. Estimates are often based on the [[solar constant]] (total insolation power density) rather than the temperature, size, and distance of the Sun. For example, using 0.4 for albedo, and an insolation of 1400 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, one obtains an effective temperature of about 245 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Cosmology==

The [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation observed today is the most perfect black-body radiation ever observed in nature, with a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. |last1=White |year=1999 |title= Anisotropies in the CMB |arxiv= astro-ph/9903232 |bibcode = 1999dpf..conf.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "snapshot" of the radiation at the time of [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] between matter and radiation in the early universe. Prior to this time, most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal, though not full thermodynamic, equilibrium with radiation.

According to Kondepudi and Prigogine, at very high temperatures (above 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K; such temperatures existed in the very early universe), where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons in spite of the strong nuclear forces, electron-positron pairs appear and disappear spontaneously and are in thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation. These particles form a part of the black body spectrum, in addition to the electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998|pages = 227–228}}; also Section 11.6, pages 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doppler effect for a moving black body==

The [[relativistic Doppler effect]] causes a shift in the frequency ''f'' of light originating from a source that is moving in relation to the observer, so that the wave is observed to have frequency ''f''':
:&lt;math&gt;f' = f \frac{1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos \theta}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v'' is the velocity of the source in the observer's rest frame, ''θ'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;The Doppler Effect, T. P. Gill, Logos Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; This can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards (''θ'' = π) or away (''θ'' = 0) from the observer, and for speeds much less than ''c''.

Through Planck's law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature (''T'') for the frequency in this equation.

For the case of a source moving directly towards or away from the observer, this reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;T' = T \sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''v'' &gt; 0 indicates a receding source, and ''v'' &lt; 0 indicates an approaching source.

This is an important effect in astronomy, where the velocities of stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions of ''c''. An example is found in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which exhibits a dipole anisotropy from the Earth's motion relative to this black-body radiation field.

==History==

===Balfour Stewart===

In 1858, [[Balfour Stewart]] described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of [[Pierre Prevost]] and of [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]. He wrote "Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power." More an experimenter than a logician, Stewart failed to point out that his statement presupposed an abstract general principle, that there exist either ideally in theory or really in nature bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing power, likewise for radiating power, for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature. 

Stewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Stokes-[[Helmholtz reciprocity]] principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.

Stewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{harvnb|Siegel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of ''[[vis viva]]''. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black surfaces. He concluded that his experiments showed that in a cavity in thermal equilibrium, the heat radiated from any part of the interior bounding surface, no matter of what material it might be composed, was the same as would have been emitted from a surface of the same shape and position that would have been composed of lamp-black. He did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way.

===Gustav Kirchhoff===

In 1859, not knowing of Stewart's work, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff then went on to consider some bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}.

Here is used a notation different from Kirchhoff's. Here, the emitting power {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'')}} denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index {{math|''i''}} at temperature {{math|''T''}}. The total absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature {{math|''T''}} . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart's, Kirchhoff's definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature {{math|''T''}} is denoted by {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} . Again, the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.

In a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860b}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Schirrmacher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index {{math|''i''}} . In this report there was no mention of black bodies.

In 1860, still not knowing of Stewart's measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}, has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index {{math|''i''}}.&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt;

But more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of "perfectly black bodies," which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck's black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff's proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled {{math|''i''}} as well as various perfect black bodies labeled {{math|BB}} . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . His proof intended to show that the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was independent of the nature {{math|''i''}} of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.

His proof first argued that for wavelength {{math|''λ''}} and at temperature {{math|''T''}}, at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}} of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorption ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB) / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}} is again just {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was equal to {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, which may now be denoted {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, a continuous function, dependent only on {{math|''λ''}} at fixed temperature {{math|''T''}}, and an increasing function of {{math|''T''}} at fixed wavelength {{math|''λ''}}, at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature {{math|''i''}} of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)

Thus [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]] can be stated: ''For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature {{math|T}}, for every wavelength {{math|λ}}, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by {{math|B&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; (λ, T)}} .'' (For our notation {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, Kirchhoff's original notation was simply {{math|''e''}}.)&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1950|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1930|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. Occasionally by historians that function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} has been called "Kirchhoff's (emission, universal) function,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Paschen|Paschen, F.]] (1896), personal letter cited by {{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra and Rechenberg|1982|pages=26, 28, 31, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later.&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt; Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart's, and in some respects it was so.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; Kirchhoff's 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with [[Carnot's principle]], which is a form of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1862/1882|page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Helge Kragh, "Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the "black-body" radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body image law''' is the  developing area of law that,  according to Dr Marilyn Bromberg of the [[University of Western Australia]] Law School and Cindy Halliwell, a law student at [[Deakin University]], "encompasses the bills, laws and government actions (such as establishing parliamentary inquiries and creating policies) that may help to improve the [[body image]] of the general public, and particularly of young people".&lt;ref name="mb/ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromberg|first1=Marilyn|last2=Halliwell|first2=Cindy|title=All About That Bass’ and Photoshopping a Model’s Waist: Introducing Body Image Law|journal=The University of Notre Dame Australia Law Review|date=2016|volume=18|url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/undalr/vol18/iss1/1/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for implementing law in this area is to prevent the images of unhealthily thin women causing poor body image which can, along with other factors, lead to an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name="mb/ch" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]] passed a body image law in 2012 which became operational the following year. The law requires models to have a minimum [[body mass index]] to work and if an image was photoshopped to make the model appear thinner, it must have a warning. The warning must state that the image was modified and it must take up at least seven percent of the image. Breaches can result in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel: Restrictions on Depiction of Underweight Models in Commercials|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-restrictions-on-depiction-of-underweight-models-in-commercials/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[French Government]]  passed a similar law in 2015 which came into effect in 2017. This law requires that models provide their employers with a "medical certificate, valid for up to two years, confirming their general physical well-being and the fact that they are not excessively underweight." &lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI of models older than 16 will also be taken into consideration, when determining their overall health.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; 

In contrast to the Israeli law, breaching it attracts criminal sanctions.&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Vanessa|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, any photo that has been digitally altered must be labeled as such; failure to label these photos will result in a "fine of 37,500 euros, or more than $41,000," and hiring a model without the verified medical certificate and requirements "carries a fine of €75,000 and six months in jail." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The law dictates that digitally altered images must be labeled "applies only to advertising, not to editorial images in magazines or newspapers." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

The [[Greater London Authority]] banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image on [[Transport for London]] public transport in 2016.&lt;ref name="ap/mo"&gt;{{cite news|title=London mayor bans Tube ads that promote unhealthy body image|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3640626/London-mayor-takes-aim-body-shaming-advertising-Tube.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[Mail Online]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Trondheim]] in Norway banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image in public places in 2017.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Gabriel|title=Norwegian city bans adverts featuring semi-nude models|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-trondheim-ban-adverts-semi-naked-models-negative-body-image-a7026421.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s position in this area is that it is up to industry to solve the problem of poor body image.&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Jessica|title=Skinny models: Australia welcomes Paris ban|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/skinny-models-australia-welcomes-paris-ban-20150319-1m36t7.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the previous Labor Government created a non-binding Voluntary Industry Code of Conduct on Body Image.&lt;ref name="apo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary industry code of conduct on body image|url=http://apo.org.au/node/21888|publisher=Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12442">A '''burn pit''' refers to an area in military sites devoted to [[Incineration#Burn pile|open-air combustion]] of [[waste|trash]]. The phrase was first used to refer to the common way of getting rid of waste at the U.S. military sites in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Due to modern waste at and around these sites containing significant amounts of plastic and other material which may emit [[air pollution|toxic aerial compounds]] and [[Particulate#Health effects|particulates]] when burned, the burn pits were heavily criticized and resulted in a suit by veterans. Global environmental consciousness has especially criticized these instances of large-scale burn pit operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/PUBLICHEALTH/exposures/burnpits/index.asp|title=Burn Pits|last=|first=|date=2011|website=publichealth.va.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Iraq and Afghanistan U.S. military burn pit operation scandal ==
In 2010, a large-scale burn pit operation in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], allegedly operated by the U.S. military or its contractors such as [[KBR (company)#"Burn pits" lawsuits|KBR]], was reported to have allowed the operation of the burn pits for long periods of time, burning many tons of assorted waste. Active duty personnel reported respiratory difficulties and headaches in some cases while some veterans made disability claims based on respiratory system symptoms allegedly derived from the burn pits.&lt;ref name="veterans"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/07/us/07burn.html "Veterans Sound Alarm Over Burn-Pit Exposure"] article by James Risen in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 6, 2010, accessed August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota mother, Amie Muller, was a victim of the exposure and her senator, [[Amy Klobuchar]] (MN-DFL), carried a bill called the “Helping Vets Exposed to Burn Pits Act”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinecountycourier.com/single-post/2017/11/11/A-courageous-battle-on-the-homefront&lt;/ref&gt; that was passed and signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] (as H.R. 5895) on September 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-5895-law/&lt;/ref&gt;  Through 2019, it will provide $5 million for burn pit research, education and evaluation of the exposure of other U.S. service members and veterans to burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigislandnow.com/2018/09/14/bill-to-fund-military-veterans-clean-energy-programs-passes/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The materials burned and combustion products ===
In the Iraq and Afghanistan incidents of burn pit operation involving the US military, it was reported that every type of waste was burned, including: plastics, batteries, appliances, medicine, dead animals, even human body parts with [[jet fuel]] being used as an [[accelerant]]. Clouds of black smoke resulted.&lt;ref name="veterans" /&gt; According to an Air Force fact sheet, "Burning solid wastes in an open pit generates numerous pollutants. These pollutants include [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[Incinerator bottom ash|ash]]. Highly toxic dioxins, produced in small amounts in almost all burning processes, can be produced in elevated levels with increased combustion of plastic waste (such as discarded drinking water bottles) and if the combustion is not at high incinerator temperatures. Inefficient combustion of medical or latrine wastes can emit disease-laden aerosols."

=== Locations ===
[[Joint Base Balad]], the largest U.S. base in Iraq had a burn pit operation as late as the summer of 2008 burning 147 tons of waste per day when the ''[[Army Times]]'' published a major story about it and about health concerns. An Air Force spokesman speaking for the [[United States Air Forces Central|609th Combined Air and Space Operations Center Southwest Asia]] vigorously contested allegations of health effects and emphasized mitigation efforts.&lt;ref name = "AT" &gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/10/military_burnpit_102708w/ "Burn pit at Balad raises health concerns]: Troops say chemicals and medical waste burned at base are making them sick, but officials deny risk" article by Kelly Kennedy in ''[[Army Times]]'' Oct 29, 2008, accessed August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Afghanistan, at its peak, more than 400 tons of trash were disposed using burn pits a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vlahos |first=Kelley Beaucar |title=‘Indefensible’: Report reveals extent of ‘burn pit’ pollution inhaled by US troops in Afghanistan |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/14/indefensible-report-reveals-extent-burn-pit-pollution-inhaled-by-us-troops-in/ |newspaper=Fox News |date=14 February 2015 |access-date=21 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Within a mile of BIAP (Baghdad International Airport) and also within a mile of camps Cropper and Stryker was one of these burn pits.  The ash rained down on us like snowflakes - not only on US troops, but also Iraqi detainees and Iraqi correctional officers (aka ICO's). There were flakes of ash the size of half a sheet of notebook paper.  That installation was perpetually downwind of one particular burn pit, and while this wasn't an everyday occurrence, during winter of 2007 into 2008 it did happen often.  This is not to speak for the frequency of the burnings, but the ash literally came down like snowfall over the facility." {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Duration===
The burn pits were allegedly adopted as a temporary measure but remained open long after alternative methods of disposal such as [[incineration]] were available. After some years the American military did adopt other methods.
&lt;ref name="veterans" /&gt;

===Health effects===
In November 2009, at the request of the Veteran's Administration (VA), the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) began an 18-month study to determine the long-term health effects of exposure to the burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.

At the request of the VA and the Department of Defense, the Board on the Health of Select Populations of the [[Institute of Medicine]] formed the Committee on Long-term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan which held its first meeting February 23, 2010 - February 24, 2010 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/meetingview.aspx?MeetingID=4206&amp;MeetingNo=1 First Meeting of the Committee on the Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan Keck Center of the National Academies], accessed August 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reviewed the scientific literature related to the possibility of adverse long-term health effects of open burn pits. The report, Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Long-Term-Health-Consequences-of-Exposure-to-Burn-Pits-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan.aspx Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan, accessed July 9, 2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531095441/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Long-Term-Health-Consequences-of-Exposure-to-Burn-Pits-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan.aspx |date=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noted U.S. Department of Defense air quality monitoring data measured levels of particulate matter (PM) higher than generally considered safe by U.S. regulatory agencies. It also cited work linking high PM levels to cardiopulmonary effects, particularly in individuals at increased risk due to pre-existing conditions such as asthma and emphysema. They concluded that there is only limited evidence suggestive "of an association between exposure to combustion products and reduced pulmonary function in these populations."

If there is sufficient evidence of a connection between exposure to burn pits and subsequent illness and disability, it might serve as the basis for congressional enactment of a "presumption of service connection" similar to that in place for exposure to Agent Orange.

The VA Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry&lt;ref&gt;[https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, accessed July 9, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  established in 2014 of to gather information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/burn-pits-at-us-bases-in-iraq-afghanistan-blamed-for-veterans-illnesses-1.515066|title=Burn pits at US bases in Iraq, Afghanistan blamed for veterans' illnesses|work=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/index.html#page/faq/collapse15 Veterans] and [https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/index.html#page/faq/collapse16 Servicemembers] collected through a questionnaire.

This report highlights health conditions and physical limitations experienced by burn pit registry participants.
*The most common doctor-diagnosed health problems reported were insomnia and neurological problems.
*Other commonly diagnosed health problems reported include allergies, high blood pressure, and lung disease like emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.
*It is important to remember that Registry findings alone can't tell if exposure to burn pits, dust storms, or other hazards caused these health conditions.

'''Catherine de' Medici's building projects''' included the [[House of Valois|Valois]] chapel at [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], the [[Tuileries Palace]], and the Hôtel de la Reine in Paris, and extensions to the [[Château de Chenonceau|château of Chenonceau]],&lt;!--Please see thread at top of talk page for conventions of spelling, capitalisation, and language regarding "château" and related usages in this article--&gt; near [[Blois]]. Born in 1519 in Florence to an Italian father and a French mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]] was a daughter of both the [[Italian Renaissance|Italian]] and the [[French Renaissance]]. She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the [[Medici]] popes, [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, she left Italy and married [[Henry II of France|Henry]], the second son of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany|Queen Claude]] of France. On doing so, she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"&gt;Knecht, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; 

King Francis set his daughter-in-law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together, forging the style that became known as the first [[School of Fontainebleau]]. Francis died in 1547, and Catherine became queen consort of France. But it wasn't until her husband King Henry's death in 1559, when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France, that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture. Over the next three decades, she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy. During the same period, however, religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb.&lt;ref&gt;"The [[Day of the Barricades]]" (12 May 1589), in which a mob took over the streets of Paris, "reduced the authority and prestige of the monarchy to its lowest ebb for a century and a half". Morris, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catherine loved to supervise each project personally.&lt;ref&gt;The architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]] wrote: "your good judgement (''bon esprit'') shows itself more and more and shines as you yourself take the trouble to project and sketch out (''protraire et esquicher'') the buildings which it pleases you to commission". Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The architects of the day dedicated books to her, knowing that she would read them.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228. The poet [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] accused her of preferring masons to poets.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, little remains of Catherine's investment today: one [[Doric order|Doric]] column, a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis. The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost, or scattered, often damaged or incomplete, in museums and churches. Catherine de' Medici's reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects. These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage. 

==Influences==

Historians often assume that Catherine's love for the arts stemmed from her [[Medici]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;  "As the daughter of the Medici," suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, ''The Louvre'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Florence in 1519, Catherine lived at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici palace]], built by [[Cosimo de' Medici]] to designs by [[Michelozzo| Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Rome in 1530, she lived, surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures, at another Medici palace (now called the [[Palazzo Madama]]). There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; When she later commissioned buildings herself, in France, Catherine often turned to Italian models. She based the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] on the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti palace]] in Florence;&lt;ref&gt;Hautecœur, 523.&lt;/ref&gt; and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the [[Uffizi| Uffizi palace]] in mind.&lt;ref name="Thomson1"&gt;Thomson, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Chat Chambord solcou 01 062006.jpg| thumb| left| [[Château de Chambord|Château of Chambord]], built by [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]]]

Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orléans]], the second son of King [[Francis I of France]]. Though she kept in touch with her native Florence, her taste matured at the [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] royal court of France.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;  Her father-in-law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht 176; Frieda, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Francis was a compulsive builder. He began extension works at the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 80. These extensions, supervised by [[Pierre Lescot]] and featuring relief sculptures by [[Jean Goujon]], were continued by the last four Valois kings.&lt;/ref&gt; added a wing to the old castle at [[Château de Blois|Blois]], and built the vast château of [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]], which he showed off to the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1539. He also transformed the lodge at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] into one of the great palaces of Europe, a project that continued under [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. Artists such as [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and [[Francesco Primaticcio]] worked on the interior, alongside French craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  This meeting of Italian [[Mannerism]] and French patronage bred an original style, later known as the first [[School of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring [[fresco]]es and high-relief [[stucco]] in the shape of parchment or curled leather [[strapwork]], it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel. She also patronised French talent, such as the architects [[Philibert de l'Orme]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and the sculptor [[Germain Pilon]].&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;

[[File:Insignias of Henri II of France and Catherine de Medici.jpg| thumb| Initials of Henry II and Catherine on a chimney at Chenonceau&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111. Some scholars believe that the intertwined letter Cs may also refer to crescent moons, the emblem of Henry's lover [[Diane de Poitiers]] (the crescent moon was the symbol of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]). However, Catherine continued to use this monogram after Henry's death.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The death of Henry II from [[jousting]] wounds in 1559 changed Catherine's life. From that day, she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine's lifelong mourning was not only a manner to express grief: it was also the legitimisation of her political role." Hoogvliet, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; She also became intent on immortalizing her sorrow at the death of her husband.&lt;ref name = "kccxxiii"&gt;Knecht, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.&lt;ref name = "kccxxiii"/&gt;  She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry, as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel. 

In 1562, a long poem by Nicolas Houël likened Catherine to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who had built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], as a tomb for her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108. Louis Le Roy, in his ''Ad illustrissimam reginam D. Catherinam Medicem'' of 1560, was the first to call Catherine the "new Artemisia".&lt;/ref&gt;  Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children. Houël laid stress on Artemesia's devotion to architecture. In his dedication to ''L'Histoire de la Royne Arthémise'', he told Catherine: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You will find here the edifices, columns, and pyramids that she had built both at Rhodes and Halicarnassus, which will serve as remembrances for those who reflect on our times and who will be astounded at your own buildings–the palaces at the Tuileries, Montceaux, and Saint-Maur, and the infinity of others that you have constructed, built, and embellished with sculptures and beautiful paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Knecht, 224. Catherine commissioned the artists [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] and [[Antoine Caron]] to illustrate the poem. The drawings were subsequently turned into tapestries, none of which survive; but, according to Knecht, fifty-nine of the drawings survive. Hoogvliet, 108, on the other hand, says that sixty-eight of the drawings survive.&lt;br /&gt;• Frieda, 266. The story of Artemisia formed an [[iconography]] for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents [[Marie de' Medici]] (1610–20) and [[Anne of Austria]] (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Valois Chapel==
In memory of Henry II, Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
To lead the Valois chapel project, Catherine chose [[Francesco Primaticcio]], who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau. Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building, crowned by a dome, to be joined to the north [[transept]] of the basilica. The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with [[pilaster]]s, columns, and [[epitaphs]] in coloured marble. The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Primaticcio's circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and [[Philibert de l'Orme]], who had built previous royal tombs. Whereas de l'Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side, Primaticcio's design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan "a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space".&lt;ref&gt;''L'art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'' (Zerner, 1996: 349–54), quoted by Knecht, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades. Primaticcio died in 1570, and the architect [[Jean Bullant]] took over the project two years later. After Bullant's death in 1578, [[Androuet du Cerceau|Baptiste du Cerceau]] led the work.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was abandoned in 1585. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb===
[[File:Basilica di saint Denis tomba enrico II e caterina de' Medici 03.JPG| thumb|Effigies on the tomb of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], carved by [[Germain Pilon]]&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 227. Henry's gesture is now unclear, since a [[missal]], resting on a [[prie-dieu]] (prayer desk), was removed from the sculpture during the French revolution and melted down.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived. These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry—in Zerner's view, "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance".&lt;ref name = "zccclxxvix"&gt;Zerner, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Primaticcio himself designed its structure, which eliminated the traditional [[bas-relief]]s and kept ornamentation to a minimum.&lt;ref name = "zccclxxvix"/&gt; The sculptor [[Germain Pilon]], who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I, carved the tomb's two sets of effigies, which represented death below and eternal life above.&lt;ref&gt;"With the rise of naturalistic representations beginning in the fifteenth century, the afterlife was imagined as an exact replica of earthly existence. As a result, the tombs of the mighty often insinuated an ambiguous conflation of the glorious Life Eternal with a glorification of their earthly lives." Zerner, 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The king and queen, cast in bronze, kneel in prayer (''priants'') on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns. Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. Pilon's feel for the material, however, invests his statues with a greater sense of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94. Blunt believes that [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s Fontainebleau ''nymph'' may have influenced their carving.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before they were destroyed in the Revolution, the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner 383–84. [[Girolamo della Robbia]] was originally commissioned to carve the queen's corpse, but his effort, in which Catherine looks emaciated, was left unfinished in 1566 and is now in the Louvre.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 379; Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later [[gisant]]s of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner suggests that these two, apparently superfluous, recumbent effigies, as rigid as those from the thirteenth century, might have been a "call to order". In the context of the wars of religion, they may have represented a pulling back from the sensuality of the tomb, which "was bound to appear somewhat pagan". Zerner, 382–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon's four bronze statues of the [[cardinal virtues]] stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall [[Pierre Bontemps|Bontemps']] work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statuary===
[[File:Resurrection Pilon Louvre RF2292 MR1592 MR1593.jpg| thumb| Surviving fragments of [[Germain Pilon| Germain Pilon's]] ''Resurrection'' (1580s), commissioned by Catherine de' Medici for the Valois Chapel complex]]

In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb. Among these, the fragmentary ''Resurrection'', now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383. Whereas the "Resurrection" for the tomb of Francis I was positioned close to the corpses, this design would have involved the visitor.&lt;/ref&gt; This work owes a clear debt to [[Michelangelo]], who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici chapels]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95. Pilon based the Christ on [[Michelangelo| Michelangelo's]] cartoon for ''Noli me tangere'' (1531) and carved the soldiers in Michelangelo's ''[[contrapposto]]'' style.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon's statue of ''St Francis in Ecstasy'' now stands in the church of St Jean and St François. In art historian Anthony Blunt's view, it marks a departure from the tension of [[Mannerism]] and "almost foreshadows" the [[Baroque]].&lt;ref name = "bvc"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France. Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio's decorations at Fontainebleau:&lt;ref name = "bxivc"/&gt; the work of his predecessor [[Jean Goujon]], for example, is more linear and classical.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the [[French Wars of Religion|French wars of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montceaux==
Catherine's earliest building project was the château of [[Montceaux-en-Brie]], near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, three years before his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a [[pavilion#Classical architecture|pavilion]] at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played [[pall mall (game)|pall mall]], an early form of [[croquet]]. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a [[grotto]]. He set it on a base made to look like natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt; The château ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Coope, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/750560 "The Chateau of Montceaux-en-Brie"], 71–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuileries==
[[File:Map of Tuileries and Louvre, as in c. 1589.png|thumb| Detail from a [[Eight maps of Paris from Traité de la police|1705 map of Paris]], showing the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] and the [[Louvre]] in about 1589]]

After the death of Henry II, Catherine abandoned the palace of the [[Hôtel des Tournelles|Tournelles]], where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a [[jousting|joust]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 104. Catherine planned a grid of streets to replace the palace, with houses designed by de l'Orme, but the work was never carried out. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], who ruled France from 1589 to 1610, later constructed a square on the site called the Place Royale, now known as the [[Place des Vosges]].&lt;/ref&gt; To replace the Tournelles, she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or ''tuileries''. The site was close to the congested Louvre, where she kept her household. The grounds extended along the banks of the [[Seine]] and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west.&lt;ref name = "cccxxxv"&gt;Frieda, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up. It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe. Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris, as seen from the river, into a monumental complex.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 165.&lt;br /&gt;• This [[:Image:Louvre tuileries.jpg|engraving]] by [[Matthäus Merian]] shows the complex in 1615, after [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV's]] additions.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Detail of the elevation of the court side of the de l'Orme wing of the Tuileries..jpg| thumb| left| Detail of the court side of the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]], designed by Philibert de l'Orme, drawn by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]]]]

To design the new palace, Catherine brought back [[Philibert de l'Orme]] from disgrace. This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of [[Henry II of France|Henry II's]] reign, after making too many enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 229. Historian R. J. Knecht suggests, (after Blunt, ''Philibert de l'Orme'', London, 1958), that Catherine may have been moved to rehabilitate de l'Orme after reading his ''Instruction'', in which he defended himself against all charges and pleaded for fair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;• Randall, 82–84. The reasons for de l'Orme's disgrace are not clear, but it seems that he was prone to arrogance and had made enemies.&lt;br /&gt;• Zerner, 402. Zerner, who calls him "haughty", mentions allegations of [[embezzlement]] and an incident in which de l'Orme and his brother killed two men in a brawl.&lt;/ref&gt; De l'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture, but his ideas are not fully known. It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles. De l'Orme is said to have "taught France the classical style—lucid, rational and regular".&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme recorded that Catherine told him "to make several encrustations of different kinds of marble, gilded bronze and of minerals, like marcassites" on both the inside and the outside of the building. Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to [[Jean Bullant|Bullant's]] later work and to a less classical style of architecture.&lt;ref name = "blv"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the [[pilaster]]s of Catherine's palace, de l'Orme chose the [[Ionic order]], which he considered a feminine form:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I will not go on to other matters without pointing out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, which is what the ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that [principle], shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Thomson, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Catherine de' Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme wrote that Catherine, with "an admirable understanding combined with great prudence and wisdom," took the trouble "to order the organization of her said palace (the Tuileries) as to the apartments and location of the halls, antechambers, chambers, closets and galleries, and to give the measurements of width and length". Quoted by Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; De l'Orme records, for example, that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the [[dormer]]s to make room for inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 171; Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 55. The way the [[dormer]]s overlap the [[pediment]]ed panels gives the effect of blurrier lines than in the more classical works de l'Orme had designed for Henry II.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side.&lt;ref name = "blv"/&gt; Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [Paris] and the Château de la Punta in [[Corsica]] show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 171&lt;br /&gt;•  Pons, 79. Counts Jérome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the château de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of [[Ajaccio]] (1885–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

De l'Orme's original plans have not survived. [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]], however, has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 229; Thomson 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168. In June 1565 and September 1581, Catherine had temporary oval structures built to house entertainments for state occasions.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the ''Petite Galerie'', was completed in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 173. The reliefs on the arches of the ''Petite Galerie'', like those on the court front of the Louvre, symbolise the might and [[moral authority]] of the Valois monarchy. Those of de l'Orme at the Tuileries are purely classical in style and follow the principles of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was left to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the ''Grande Galerie'' that finally linked the two palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by [[Jean Bullant]]. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the [[classical order]]s, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 173–4. The only elements Bullant harmonised with de l'Orme's work were the ground-floor Ionic columns and the [[frieze]] and [[cornice]] between the first and ground floors.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dom Michel Felibien 001.jpg| thumb| left| [[Jean Bullant| Jean Bullant's]] pavilion at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]], in an engraving of 1725 by Michel Félibien]]

Despite its unfinished state, Catherine often visited the palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens.&lt;ref name = "cccxxxv"/&gt; According to the French military leader [[Gaspard de Saulx|Marshal Tavannes]], it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 306.&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter [[Bernard Palissy]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"&gt;Knecht, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the [[Valois Tapestries|Valois tapestries]]. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|crown of Poland]] to her son, the duke of Anjou, later [[Henry III of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] later added to the Tuileries; but [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was to dismantle sections of the palace. The [[communards]] set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint-Maur==
The palace of [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's unfinished projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of [[Jean du Bellay|Cardinal Jean du Bellay]], after the latter's death in 1560.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; She then commissioned de l'Orme to finish the work he had begun there. Drawings by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] in the [[British Museum]] may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the [[Pavilion#Classical architecture|pavilion]]s next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[pilaster]]s. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.&lt;ref name = "blv"/&gt;

De l'Orme died in 1570; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint-Maur.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 89, believes this architect was [[Jean Bullant]], of whom he writes: "In these last years, Bullant's desire for the colossal seems to have grown greater, and in this case it could not be harmonized with the existing building".&lt;/ref&gt; The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs. He also planned two more arches over de l'Orme's terrace, which joined the pavilions on the garden side.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 231. The terrace was supported by a [[cryptoporticus]], a covered passageway.&lt;/ref&gt; In historian R. J. Knecht's view, the scheme would have given this part of the house, a "colossal, even grotesque" [[pediment]].&lt;ref name ="ccxxxi"&gt;Knecht, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was only partly carried out, and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in.

==Hôtel de la Reine==
[[File:Soisson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A 1650 engraving by [[Israel Silvestre|Israël Silvestre]] of the Hôtel de la Reine in [[Paris]]: the central and right-hand sections are those built during Catherine's lifetime. The Colonne de l'Horoscope can be seen in the background, to the right.]]
{{main|Hôtel de Soissons}}

After de l'Orme's death, Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine's chief architect. In 1572, Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls. She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 230. Between 1575 and 1583, for example, the number of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting rose from 68 to 111.&lt;/ref&gt; To make space for the new scheme and its gardens, she had an entire area of Paris demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 335. The area, in the parish of [[Église Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], included the Hôtel Guillart and the Hôtel d'Albret.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new palace was known in Catherine's time as the Hôtel de la Reine and later as the Hôtel de Soissons.&lt;ref name="Thomson1"/&gt; Engravings made by [[Israel Silvestre|Israël Silvestre]] in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the Hôtel de la Reine possessed a central wing, a courtyard, and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Hotel de la reine 1700.jpg|Plan of the Hôtel de la Reine, from an engraving of about 1700.]] Thomson, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The walled gardens of the hôtel included an [[aviary]], a lake with a water jet, and long avenues of trees. Catherine also installed an [[orangery]] that could be dismantled in winter.&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt; The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant's death in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 176–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The building  was demolished in the 1760s.
All that remains of the Hôtel de la Reine today is a single [[Doric order|Doric]] column, known as the Colonne de l'Horoscope or [[Medici column]], which stood in the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 176&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen next to the domed [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de commerce]]. Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it "a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chenonceau== 
[[File:Schloss Chenonceau.JPG| thumb| Catherine had two galleries built on Diane's bridge over the [[Cher River]] at [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]].]]

In 1576, Catherine decided to enlarge her château of [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this property from Henry's mistress [[Diane de Poitiers]]. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her.&lt;ref name = "fcxxxxiv"&gt;Frieda, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, she gave Diane the less prized [[Château de Chaumont|Chaumont]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt;  When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as [[pentagram|pentangles]] drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her château of [[château d'Anet|Anet]] and never set foot in Chaumont again.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau, such as de l'Orme's bridge over the [[Cher River]]. Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival's work.&lt;ref name = "fcxxxxiv"/&gt; She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge. The architect was almost certainly Bullant. The decorations show the fantasy of his late style.&lt;ref name = "blxxxix"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SchlossChenonceauPlanvonKatharinavonMedici.png| left| thumb| [[Jean Bullant| Jean Bullant's]] planned enlargements at [[Chenonceau]] (c. 1572), drawn by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]], 1579]]
Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them.&lt;ref&gt;Benes, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; At Chenonceau, she added waterfalls, [[menagerie]]s, and [[aviary|aviaries]], laid out three parks, and planted [[mulberry]] trees for [[Bombyx mori|silkworms]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt;  [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau. A [[trapezoid]]al lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular [[atrium (architecture)|atria]] joined to two halls that flank the original house.&lt;ref name = "tclxxv"&gt;Thomson, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant's plans. Du Cerceau "sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 232, quotes Blunt, ''Philibert de l'Orme'' (London, 1958), 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine's. Like Bullant, he became a more fantastical designer with time.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau.&lt;ref name = "tclxxv"/&gt; In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume ''Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France'', a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 91. The original drawings are now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the dynasty==
Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague, famine, and economic hardship in France. &lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, 280–81. So widespread and serious was the plague of 1565, for example, that Catherine had the surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] write an account of it. He concluded that plague resulted from poisoning of the air and was "often sent by the just anger of God punishing our offences".&lt;/ref&gt; As the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its [[moral authority]] was in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely extravagant. This was especially true in Paris, where the ''[[parlement]]'' was often asked to contribute to her costs. 

[[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] captured the mood in a poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The queen must cease building,
Her lime must stop swallowing our wealth...
Painters, masons, engravers, stone-carvers
Drain the treasury with their deceits.
Of what use is her Tuileries to us?
Of none, Moreau; it is but vanity.
It will be deserted within a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 233. Ronsard addressed these lines to the financial official Raoul Moreau. ''Au tresorier de l'esparne'' (ca. 1573).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. The death of Catherine's beloved son [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] in 1589, a few months after her own, brought the Valois dynasty to an end. Precious little of Catherine's grand building work has survived.

The '''[[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of feathers''' can be a real challenge for conservators and requires knowledge of specialized care procedures and potential environmental problems like pests.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Contour feather.jpg|thumb|The anatomy of a contour feather]]

=== Basic Overview ===
-Feathers are made of a protein commonly found in the bodies of many animals known as [[keratin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160539034/conservation-biologist-explains-why-feathers-matter|title=Conservation Biologist Explains Why 'Feathers' Matter|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-Feathers take on a protective function

-91% protein, 8% water, and 1% lipids&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdfs/cnsv-feathers.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout|last=|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-The most common types of feathers are contour and down&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/_includes/docs/research/lifeSciences/ornithology/Hudon1.pdf|title=Considerations in the Conservation of Feathers and Hair, Particularly their Pigments|last=Hudon|first=Jocelyn|date=2005|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Although there are many different parts to a feather, all of the parts fall into two subsections of the feather. The two main sections of the feather are the shaft and the vane.

==== Shaft&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Feathers|title=Feathers - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The shaft is composed of the calamus and the rachis. The calamus can also be called the quill and is the hollow portion of the shaft that enters the skin follicle. While the rachis is the solid portion of the shaft  where the barbs attach.

==== Vane&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====
The vane extends to either side of the rachis and is made up of interconnecting barbs. This is considered the most substantial portion of the feather.

== Conservation care ==

=== Cleaning ===
Removing debris and organic matter from feathers is a key step in the conservation process. Here are several of the ways that feathers are typically cleaned by conservators:

==== Vacuuming ====
Using a small vacuum allows conservators to clean off dust and other particulate debris that is not embedded on to the feather. This method cannot be done by conservators when dealing with fragile feathers due to the likelihood of damage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Effective Method for Cleaning Feather Bonnets|url=https://www.icom-cc.org/54/document/ethnographic-conservation-newsletter-31-february-2010/?action=Site_Downloads_Downloadfile&amp;id=769.|last=Fonicello|first=Nancy|website=|publisher=&lt;!--|date=January 2010--&gt;|date = February 2010|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solvents ====
Certain gentle solvents are typically used to "dry clean" feathers. One such solvent, isopropyl alcohol, is usually diluted to make it less caustic to the specimen. Isopropyl alcohol is also a fast drying solution that will not cause the feathers to remain wet for an extended period of time. Gentle soaps and solvents will often also be used on living specimens when approved by a vet or zoologist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Warkworth Museum - Kiwi feather basket.jpg|thumb|191x191px|Feather Basket from the Warkworth Museum]]

=== Storage ===
The proper storage of feathers and other organic material is essential for the survival of the object. Relative humidity in the storage area is always kept in the 50% range and the ambient temperature is controlled at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|last=Buck|first=Rebecca|publisher=The AAM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0838911228|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative humidity is monitored with a climate control system or managed in a smaller range using silica gel packets that are added to individual storage boxes. Specially made acid free drawers or boxes are an ideal place for items containing feathers. Some of the best materials for storage of organic materials are made from "metal that is sulfur-free and painted using an electrostatic process to prevent off-gassing".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ideally, conservators would put dust covers over the items to prevent dust from building up on the object while in storage.

=== Repairing ===
A living specimen can sometimes lose some of their vital flight feathers and there are ways of repairing them to restore flight to the bird. Feathers from another source are placed in the hollow portion of the quill and securing them with small splints. In the aviary world this process is called imping. A procedure such as this allows a bird to resume flight until the old quill falls out and a new feather takes its place during molting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/gfas/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell.pdf|title=Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell|last=Glendell|first=Greg|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted birds and feathers are repaired with several simple steps. Feathers that are tattered or messy will be moved back into shape with the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.featherfolio.com/how-to-fix-a-tattered-frayed-feather/|title=How to fix a tattered, frayed feather - Featherfolio|website=Featherfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of feathers that are falling out of a mount or broken in two, the pieces are reattached with small amounts of adhesive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy|title=Conserving our taxidermy - Collections - Horniman Museum and Gardens|last=Gardens|first=The Horniman Museum and|website=www.horniman.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme care is always used to not get the adhesive stuck onto the barbs. A wheat starch paste adhesive is utilized in some cases to reattach feathers to skin or to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Special Issues ==
In the case of many of the issues contained in this section can be eliminated or reduced through the proper care instructions listed in the previous section.[[File:Dermestid beetle.png|thumb|121x121px|Dermestid Beetle also known as the Carpet Beetle]]

=== Pests&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
Due to the fact that feathers are mainly made of protein, they lend themselves a whole host of insect problems. Insects that like to eat protein based material will often feed on the feather causing serious damage.

==== Pests While Alive ====
While the birds are alive they are susceptible to several different pests including [[Louse|lice]] and [[mite]]s. Special sprays and soaps can kill these pests allowing the birds to regain feather growth and become healthy.

==== Pests In Collections ====
Once the feathers make it into a non-living collection atmosphere it is possible for them to fall victim to insects including the [[Dermestidae|carpet beetle]] and [[Clothes moth|clothing moths]].

=== Dust&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
When feathers are stored in a way that allows dust to accumulate on the object the relative humidity around the feather could rise. This rise in humidity and the addition of moisture accelerates the deterioration of the feather.

== Resources ==
There are many different sources both online and in person that can be museum workers use to learn more about feather conservation. The AIC Wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page|title=AIC WIKI Main Page|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a jumping point into a whole host of conservation topics, including the care of feathers. Many museums and conservation organizations are also providing classes in the conservation of feathers.

The '''conservation and restoration of flags and banners''' is the process by which conservators work to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] and restore flags and banners from future deterioration and damage. As a part of [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|Conservation of Textiles]], flag and banner conservation require the care of a skilled and well trained textile conservator, specifically trained in historical materials.

==Material identification==
Historical Flags are often made of [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], or thin [[wool]] bunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials were used in the making of flags, primarily in the U.S. until the mid 20th century. Forensic examination of flags, to the level of examining the fibers of the fabrics themselves, and the threads used to sew the flags, helps identify the period of the materials used and usually is a good indicator of the period of a flag (though not necessarily, in the case of a forgery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Protein Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/77/natural-protein-fibers|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials can be very fragile and require advanced conservation techniques. Conservators are experts in stabilization and preservation of historic fabrics, flags may be in a variety of conditions from good condition to tattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk and wool are protein fibers whereas cotton and linen are vegetable fibers. The process by which they deteriorate will vary greatly and needs to be carefully addressed during conservation and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulosic Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/70/natural-cellulose-fibres-natures-own-fibres|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays many flags are made of a synthetic blend or [[nylon]] materials, which have their own unique requirements for preservation and care.

== Common causes of damage ==
Flag condition often relates to their usage during the war, so some of the most historically significant examples show the greatest damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flags were not limited to damage from war, such as bullet holes or blood stains - which have specific treatments themselves - but also damage from natural elements such as wind, light exposure, temperature, humidity and pest infestation.
*[[Wind]] damage: The mechanical action of wind forces and exposure to environmental effects can cause damage to the filament and is characterized by splitting. Visual characteristics of wind damage include fraying and even shredding in high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearle|first1=JWS|last2=Lomas|first2=B.|last3=Cooke|first3=W.D.|title=Atlas of Fibre Fracture and Damage to Textiles|date=1998|publisher=Elsevier|page=360|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*
*[[Light]] Exposure: Too much light speeds deterioration of textiles. Historic textiles, such as flags and banners should be protected from excessive light levels, and especially from sunlight and fluorescent light, which contain high amounts of ultraviolet radiation - which is the most harmful form of light. Signs of Light damage can include a brittleness of the material, overall color change of the fabric or yellowing/ browning of the textile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Concerns|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*
*[[Temperature]] and [[Humidity]] Fluctuations: Both mechanisms of decay for objects can be attributed to either too low or too high of a temperature, too high of humidity, or too much fluctuation between temperatures or humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=378|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pest (organism)|Pests]]: There are many types of pests, from [[insects]] to small [[mammals]] such as [[rodents]] that can infest an organic collection of all types. In particular, these pests can colonize textiles and cause irreparable damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=376|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the types of pests that can afflict historical flags and banners include cloth [[moths]] and [[carpet beetles]]. It is important to be vigilant of possible signs of infestation and to take preemptive measures to ensure infestation and damage does not occur. Professionals charged with the care and preservation of collections work to develop and enforce Integrated Pest Management plans (IPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8389-1122-8|page=297|edition=fifth}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure proper steps are taken to protect historic items such as flags and banners.

== Common treatments and handling ==
* Cleaning- While many people have experience cleaning everyday textiles, cleaning historical textiles is different. Conservators approach cleaning historic textiles like flags and banner very carefully as each cleaning process can create a little damage. They must weigh the pros and cons of each method carefully before proceeding. Damage such as dyes bleeding, seams shrinking or finishes being lost can occur in the cleaning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vacuuming - also referred to as surface cleaning. This method is employed by conservators when trying to remove surface dirt. Carefully vacuuming the textile on a low suction, conservators will sometimes used a screen to prevent individual fibers from getting sucked up and lost in the vacuum. This method is considered least invasive and often very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wet cleaning- or washing is a more invasive cleaning method, and one that conservators may be hesitant to use without proper review of the textile. Wet cleaning, or washing is an irreversible process, and can cause significant damage. In particular, commercial detergents and other chemicals can increase the rate of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pest Control-Prevention is better than cure. In order to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy it is important understand and recognize some of the key components of successful pest control. 
#Avoid pests- Keep the area clean a clear of clutter and inspect often.
#Prevent pest colonization- follow routine pest management.

If pest infestation occurs it is important to act fast by following the IPM plan and consulting a trusted pest control professional. If individual pieces are attacked it is important to isolate them immediately in a plastic bag or sealed between to sheets of plastic and tape and then proceed with the IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Recognize pests- what kind of infestation do you have?
#Assess the pest problem- how pervasive is the problem?
#Solve the pest problem- follow the IPM and consult a pest control professional
#Review IMP procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage ==
It is important to consider proper textile storage in the design plan of your storage facility. This room should have limited access, in the interior of the building, with no exposure to outside light, temperature controlled, and properly installed monitoring equipment. Like other organic materials, textiles can deteriorate very quickly under fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|pages=69–96}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flags and banner are no exception to this so proper storage is critical in preservation.
* Flat Storage-Flat storage mats are constructed of corrugated cardboard with a window opening that should be slightly large than the textile object. Textiles should be wrapped in neutral pH tissue. This flat mats can then be stored in flat acid free boxes.
* Rolled Storage- Flat textiles that are in good condition and in good strength can be rolled up and stored in tubes. The length of the textile tube is determined by the width of the textile. Textiles should be inter-leafed by neutral pH tissue paper and the textile secured in the tube. Textile tubes should then be stored in flat boxes made of acid free corrugated cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mounted Storage- historic flags and banners are also mounted for display and storage. It is important to keep in mind the condition of the flag prior to placing it in mounted storage.

'''Coprophilia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κόπρος, kópros—excrement'' and ''φιλία, philía—liking, fondness''), also called '''scatophilia''' or '''scat''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''σκατά, skatá-[[feces]]''),&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[paraphilia]] involving [[sexual arousal]] and pleasure from [[feces]].&lt;ref name="Corsini"&gt;{{cite book |last= Corsini |first= Raymond J. |title= The Dictionary of Psychology |publisher= Brunner-Routledge |location= Philadelphia |year= 2002 |page=224 |isbn= 1-58391-328-9 |oclc= 48932974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flora"&gt;{{cite book |last= Flora |first= Rudy |title= How to Work with Sex Offenders: A Handbook for Criminal Justice, Human Service, and Mental Health Professionals |page=91 |publisher= Haworth Clinical Practice Press |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-7890-1499-8 |oclc= 45668958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], it is classified under 302.89 – [[Paraphilia NOS]] (Not Otherwise Specified) and has no [[diagnostic]] criteria other than a general statement about paraphilias that says "the diagnosis is made if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning".  Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR notes, "Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphilic only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g. are obligatory, result in [[sexual dysfunction]], require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships)".

Although there may be no connection between coprophilia and [[sadomasochism]] (SM), the limited data on the former comes from studies of the latter.  A study of 164 males in [[Finland]] from two SM clubs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N. Kenneth Sandnabba |author2=Pekka Santtila |author3=Niklas Nordling |title=Sexual Behavior and Social Adaptation Among Sadomasochistically-Oriented Males |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=August 1999 | doi = 10.1080/00224499909551997 |volume=36 |pages=273–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 18.2% had engaged in coprophilia; 3% as a sadist, 6.1% as a masochist, and 9.1% as both. 18% of heterosexuals and 17% of homosexuals in the study pool had tried coprophilia, showing no statistically significant difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals. In a separate article analyzing 12 men who engaged in [[bestiality]], an additional analysis of an 11-man subgroup revealed that 6 had engaged in coprophilic behavior, compared with only 1 in the matched control group consisting of 12 SM-oriented males who did not engage in bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sandnabba N.K. |author2=Santtila P. |author3=Nordling N. |author4=Beetz A.M. |author5=Alison L. |title=Characteristics of a Sample of Sadomasochistically-oriented Males with Recent Experience of Sexual Contact with Animals |journal=Deviant Behavior |volume=23 |issue=6 |date=November 2002 |doi=10.1080/01639620290086503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
A couloir may be a seam, scar, or fissure, or vertical [[crevasse]] in an otherwise solid mountain mass. Though often hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, couloirs may also be less well-defined, and often simply a line of broken talus or [[scree]] ascending the mountainside and bordered by trees or other natural features. Couloirs are especially significant in winter months when they may be filled in with snow or ice, and become much more noticeable than in warmer months when most of the snow and ice may recede. These physical features make the use of couloirs popular for both [[mountaineering]] and [[skiing]].

==Winter Sports==
While in the [[United States]] such terrain features are uncommon at [[ski resort]]s, in [[Europe]] they are more common. Couloirs are frequently considered an [[off-piste]] trail and, as such, are not marked on ski [[piste]] maps. Some exceptions to this include: 
*The ''Grand Couloir'' in [[Courchevel]], [[France]], which has historically variable classifications but is now graded as a [[Piste#Ratings|black]] run under French piste difficulty grading
* The ''Massif du [[Mont Blanc]]'', which has many well-known, celebrated, and frequently visited couloirs
*''Gervasutti Couloir''
*''Breche Nonne Couloir''
*''Chevalier Couloir''
* ''Cosmiques couloirs'' 
* [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort]]'s [[Corbet's Couloir]]
* [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]] in California's run called "Nancy's Couloir"
* [[Big Sky Resort]] in Montana's
**"Big Couloir" run, which at a 50 degree pitch for over 1,000 feet of vertical is one of the most intense in-bounds trails in America
**Little Couloir, a lesser-known run located just to the side of Big Couloir, which has an even steeper pitch between 55 and 60 degrees, with the entry about 59 degrees.  
*The [[double black diamond]]  run on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, called "Couloir Extreme", which is located inside the [[Whistler-Blackcomb]] resort boundaries and can be accessed via chairlift
* The [[Norton Couloir]], on the north face of [[Mount Everest]], was descended by snowboard for the first time by French snowboarder [[Marco Siffredi]] in 2001.

An '''air diffuser''' or '''membrane diffuser''' is an [[aeration]] device typically in the shape of a disc, tube or plate, which is used to transfer air and with that oxygen into [[sewage]] or industrial [[wastewater]]. Oxygen is required by microorganisms/bacteria residents in the water to break down the pollutants. Diffusers use either rubber membranes or ceramic elements typically and produce either fine or coarse bubbles.

==Types==
Diffusers are generally referred to as either:

#[[fine bubble diffusers|Fine Bubble/Fine Pore]]
#[[coarse bubble diffusers|Coarse Bubble]]

Other diffused aeration devices include: [[jet aerators]], [[Aspirator (pump)|aspirators]], and U tubes.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.(2009). [http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_fine.pdf "Fine Bubble Aeration."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document No. EPA-832-F-99-065.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design specifications==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
Typical efficiency of a full floor coverage diffused aeration system in clean water is 2%/ft submergence or 6.6%/m submergence.  When converted to mass transfer into process or dirty water, it is typically closer to about half of those figures. Manufacturers of fine bubble systems have supported claims that the type, number and size of "pores" have a great effect on efficiency of a diffused aeration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095534/http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of diffused aeration systems==
Diffusers are typically connected to a piping system which is supplied with pressurized air by a blower. This system is commonly referred to as a '''diffused aeration system''' or '''aeration grid'''.

There are two main types of diffused aeration systems, retrievable and fixed grid, that are designed to serve different purposes.  In the case of a plant with a single tank, a retrievable system is desirable, in order to avoid stopping operation of the plant when maintenance is required on the aeration system. Fixed systems, on the other hand, are typically less costly, and often more efficient because it is easier to make full use of the floor.

Automated software is available on the web to assist with drafting of aeration systems in CAD, as well as calculation software to help determine diffuser requirements for a given wastewater.

==Developments in membrane coatings==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
A developments in recent years has been surface coatings of [[PTFE]] on [[EPDM]] [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s.   This provides a buffer between the EPDM substrate and wastewater, hence reducing the likelihood of chemical attack and oxidation, and also providing better resistance to biological fouling and calcium scaling (manufacturers claim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052647/http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endogenous retroviruses''' ('''ERVs''') are [[endogenous viral element]]s in the [[genome]] that closely resemble and can be derived from [[retrovirus]]es. They are abundant in the genomes of [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]], and they comprise  up to 5–8% of the human genome (lower estimates of ~1%).&lt;ref name=Belshaw2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nelson PN, Hooley P, Roden D, Davari Ejtehadi H, Rylance P, Warren P, Martin J, Murray PG |title=Human endogenous retroviruses: Transposable elements with potential ?|journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology|date=October 2004|volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=1–9|pmc=1809191|pmid=15373898|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2004.02592.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERVs are a subclass of a type of [[gene]] called a [[transposon]], which can be packaged and moved within the genome to serve a vital role in [[gene expression]] and in [[Gene regulation|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khodosevich|first=Konstantin|author2=Lebedev, L |author3=Sverdolv, E. |title=Endogenous retroviruses and human evolution|journal=Comparative and Functional Genomics|date=October 2002|issue=6|pages=494–98|doi=10.1002/cfg.216|volume=3 |pmid=18629260 |pmc=2448423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim FJ, Battini JL, Manel N, Sitbon M |title=Emergence of vertebrate retroviruses and envelope capture |journal=Virology |volume=318 |issue=1 |pages=183–91 |year=2004 |pmid=14972546 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0042682203006998}}
&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished as [[retrotransposons]], which are Class I elements.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12/&gt; Researchers have suggested that retroviruses evolved from a type of [[Transposable element|transposable gene]] called a [[retrotransposon]], which includes ERVs; these genes can mutate and instead of moving to another location in the genome they can become exogenous or pathogenic.

== Formation ==

The replication cycle of a [[retrovirus]] entails the insertion ("integration") of a DNA copy of the viral [[genome]] into the [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] genome of the [[Host (biology)|host]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Most retroviruses infect [[somatic cells]], but occasional infection of [[germline]] cells (cells that produce eggs and sperm) can also occur. Rarely, retroviral integration may occur in a germline cell that goes on to develop into a viable organism. This organism will carry the inserted retroviral genome as an integral part of its own genome—an "endogenous" retrovirus (ERV) that may be [[heredity|inherited]] by its [[offspring]] as a novel [[allele]]. Many ERVs have persisted in the genome of their hosts for millions of years. However, most of these have acquired inactivating [[mutation]]s during host [[DNA replication]] and are no longer capable of producing virus. ERVs can also be partially excised from the genome by a process known as recombinational deletion, in which [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between the identical sequences that flank newly integrated retroviruses results in deletion of the internal, [[protein]]-coding regions of the viral genome.

The general retrovirus genome consists of three genes vital for the invasion, replication, escape, and spreading of its viral genome. These three genes are gag (encodes for structural proteins for the viral core), pol (encodes for [[reverse transcriptase]], [[integrase]], and [[protease]]), and env (encodes for [[Viral coat protein|coat protein]]s for the virus's exterior). These viral proteins are encoded as [[polyproteins]]. In order to carry out their life cycle, the retrovirus relies heavily on the host cell's machinery. Protease degrades peptide bonds of the viral polyproteins, making the separate proteins functional. Reverse transcriptase functions to synthesize viral DNA from the viral RNA in the host cell's cytoplasm before it enters the nucleus. Integrase guides the integration of viral DNA into the host genome.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10254–10260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujiwara|first=T.|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=K.|date=1988-08-12|title=Retroviral DNA integration: structure of an integration intermediate|journal=Cell|volume=54|issue=4|pages=497–504|pmid=3401925|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90071-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous retroviruses can play an active role in shaping genomes. Most studies in this area have focused on the genomes of humans and higher primates, but other vertebrates, such as mice and sheep, have also been studied in depth.&lt;ref name=Li12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Akagi K, Hu Y, Trivett AL, Hlynialuk CJ, Swing DA, Volfovsky N, Morgan TC, Golubeva Y, Stephens RM, Smith DE, Symer DE | title = Mouse endogenous retroviruses can trigger premature transcriptional termination at a distance | journal = Genome Res | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 870–84 |date=March 2012 | pmid = 22367191 | pmc = 3337433 | doi = 10.1101/gr.130740.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no7&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spencer TE, Palmarini M | title = Endogenous retroviruses of sheep: a model system for understanding physiological adaptation to an evolving ruminant genome | journal = J Reprod Dev | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–7 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22450282 | doi = 10.1262/jrd.2011-026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black SG, Arnaud F, Palmarini M, Spencer TE | title = Endogenous Retroviruses in Trophoblast Differentiation and Placental Development | journal = American Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–264 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20528833 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2010.00860.x | pmc = 4198168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15574851"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ryan FP | title = Human endogenous retroviruses in health and disease: a symbiotic perspective | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 97 | issue = 12 | pages = 560–5 |date=December 2004 | pmid = 15574851 | pmc = 1079666 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.97.12.560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The long terminal repeat ([[Long terminal repeat|LTR]]) sequences that flank ERV genomes frequently act as alternate [[gene promoter|promoters]] and [[gene enhancer|enhancers]], often contributing to the [[alternative splicing|transcriptome]] by producing tissue-specific variants. In addition, the retroviral [[protein]]s themselves have been co-opted to serve novel host functions, particularly in reproduction and development. Recombination between homologous retroviral sequences has also contributed to gene shuffling and the generation of genetic variation. Furthermore, in the instance of potentially antagonistic effects of retroviral sequences, repressor genes have co-evolved to combat them.

Solo LTRs and LTRs associated with complete retroviral sequences have been shown to act as transcriptional elements on host genes. Their range of action is mainly by insertion into the 5' [[untranslated region|UTR]]s of protein coding genes; however, they have been known to act upon genes up to 70–100&amp;nbsp;[[base pair#Length measurements|kb]] away.&lt;ref name=Li12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pi W, Zhu X, Wu M, Wang Y, Fulzele S, Eroglu A, Ling J, Tuan D | title = Long-range function of an intergenic retrotransposon | journal = PNAS | volume = 107 | issue = 29 | pages = 12992–12997 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20615953 | pmc = 2919959 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004139107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712992P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van de Lagemaat LN, Landry JR, Mager DL, Medstrand P | title = Transposable elements in mammals promote regulatory variation and diversification of genes with specialized functions | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 530–6 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14550626 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2003.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kovalskaya06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kovalskaya E, Buzdin A, Gogvadze E, Vinogradova T, Sverdlov E | title = Functional human endogenous retroviral LTR transcription start sites are located between the R and U5 regions | journal = Virology | volume = 346 | issue = 2 | pages = 373–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16337666 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these elements are inserted in the sense direction to their corresponding genes, but there has been evidence of LTRs acting in the antisense direction and as a bidirectional promoter for neighboring genes.&lt;ref name=no11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunn CA, Romanish MT, Gutierrez LE, van de Lagemaat LN, Mager DL | title = Transcription of two human genes from a bidirectional endogenous retrovirus promoter | journal = Gene | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–42 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16288839 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2005.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gogvadze E, Stukacheva E, Buzdin A, Sverdlov E | title = Human-specific modulation of transcriptional activity provided by endogenous retroviral insertions | journal = J Virol | volume = 83 | issue = 12 | pages = 6098–105 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19339349 | pmc = 2687385 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00123-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, the LTR functions as the major promoter for the gene.

The insertion of a solo ERV-9 LTR may have produced a functional [[open reading frame]] (ORF), causing the rebirth of the human [[IRGM|immunity related GTPase gene]] (IRGM).&lt;ref name=no15&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekpen C, Marques-Bonet T, Alkan C, Antonacci F, Leogrande MB, Ventura M, Kidd JM, Siswara P, Howard JC, Eichler EE | title = Death and resurrection of the human IRGM gene | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = e1000403 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19266026 | pmc = 2644816 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ERV insertions have also been shown to generate alternative splice sites either by direct integration into the gene, as with the human leptin hormone receptor, or driven by the expression of an upstream LTR, as with the phospholipase A-2 like protein.&lt;ref name=Jern08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jern P, Coffin JM | title = Effects of Retroviruses on Host Genome Function | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 42 | issue =  | pages = 709–32 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18694346 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091501 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, however, the LTR functions as one of many alternate promoters, often conferring tissue-specific expression related to reproduction and development. In fact, 64% of known LTR-promoted transcription variants are [[Gene expression|expressed]] in reproductive tissues.&lt;ref name=no16&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver KR, Greene WK | title = Mobile DNA and the TE-Thrust hypothesis: supporting evidence from the primates | journal = Mob DNA | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21627776 | pmc = 3123540 | doi = 10.1186/1759-8753-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the gene CYP19 codes for [[aromatase]] P450, an important enzyme for estrogen synthesis, that is normally expressed in the brain and reproductive organs of most mammals.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; However, in primates, an LTR-promoted transcriptional variant confers expression to the placenta and is responsible for controlling estrogen levels during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; Furthermore, the [[NAIP (gene)|neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein]] (NAIP), normally widespread, has an LTR of the HERV-P family acting as a promoter that confers expression to the testis and prostate.&lt;ref name=no17&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanish MT, Lock WM, van de Lagemaat LN, Dunn CA, Mager DL | title = Repeated recruitment of LTR retrotransposons as promoters by the anti- apoptotic locus NAIP during mammalian evolution | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e10 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17222062 | pmc = 1781489 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proteins, such as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), interleukin-2 receptor B (IL2RB), and another mediator of estrogen synthesis, HSD17B1, are also alternatively regulated by LTRs that confer placental expression, but their specific functions are not yet known.&lt;ref name=Cohen09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=no18&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huh JW, Ha HS, Kim DS, Kim HS | title = Placenta-restricted expression of LTR- derived NOS3 | journal = Placenta | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 602–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18474398 | doi = 10.1016/j.placenta.2008.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high degree of reproductive expression is thought to be an after effect of the method by which they were endogenized; however, this also may be due to a lack of DNA methylation in germ-line tissues.&lt;ref name=Cohen09 /&gt;

The best-characterized instance of placental protein expression comes not from an alternatively promoted host gene but from a complete co-option of a retroviral protein. Retroviral fusogenic env proteins, which play a role in the entry of the virion into the host cell, have had an important impact on the development of the mammalian [[placenta]]. In mammals, intact env proteins called [[ERVWE1|syncytins]] are responsible for the formation and function of [[placenta|syncytiotrophoblasts]].&lt;ref name=Black10 /&gt; These multinucleated cells are mainly responsible for maintaining nutrient exchange and separating the fetus from the mother's immune system.&lt;ref name=Black10 /&gt; It has been suggested that the selection and fixation of these proteins for this function have played a critical role in the evolution of [[viviparity]].&lt;ref name="pmid8995601"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarreal LP, Villareal LP | title = On viruses, sex, and motherhood | journal = J.

In addition, the insertion of ERVs and their respective LTRs have the potential to induce chromosomal rearrangement due to recombination between viral sequences at inter-chromosomal loci. These rearrangements have been shown to induce gene duplications and deletions that largely contribute to genome plasticity and dramatically change the dynamic of gene function.&lt;ref name=no20&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hughes, J  |author2=Coffin, JM | title = Evidence for Genomic Rearrangements Mediated by Human Endogenous Retroviruses during Primate Evolution | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 487–92 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11704760| doi = 10.1038/ng775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, retroelements in general are largely prevalent in rapidly evolving, mammal-specific gene families whose function is largely related to the response to stress and external stimuli.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; In particular, both human [[class I MHC|class I]] and [[class II MHC]] genes have a high density of HERV elements as compared to other multi-locus-gene families.&lt;ref name=Jern08 /&gt; It has been shown that HERVs have contributed to the formation of extensively duplicated duplicon blocks that make up the HLA class 1 family of genes.&lt;ref name=Dawkins99&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawkins R, Leelayuwat C, Gaudieri S, Tay G, Hui J, Cattley S, Martinez P, Kulski J | title = Genomics of the major histocompatibility complex: haplotypes, duplication, retroviruses and disease | journal = Immunol Rev | volume = 167 | issue =  | pages = 275–304 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10319268 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.1999.tb01399.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, HERVs primarily occupy regions within and between the break points between these blocks, suggesting that considerable duplication and deletions events, typically associated with unequal crossover, facilitated their formation.&lt;ref name=no22&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doxiadis GG, de Groot N, Bontrop RE | title = Impact of Endogenous Intronic Retroviruses on Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Diversity and Stability | journal = J Virol | volume = 82 | issue = 13 | pages = 6667–77 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18448532 | pmc = 2447082 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00097-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of these blocks, inherited as immunohaplotypes, act as a protective polymorphism against a wide range of antigens that may have imbued humans with an advantage over other primates.&lt;ref name=Dawkins99 /&gt;

Finally, the insertion of ERVs or ERV elements into genic regions of host DNA, or overexpression of their transcriptional variants, has a much higher potential to produce deleterious effects than positive ones. Their appearance into the genome has created a [[host-parasite coevolution|host-parasite co-evolutionary dynamic]] that proliferated the duplication and expansion of repressor genes. The most clear-cut example of this involves the rapid duplication and proliferation of tandem [[zinc-finger]] genes in mammal genomes. Zinc-finger genes, particularly those that include a KRAB domain, exist in high copy number in vertebrate genomes, and their range of functions are limited to transcriptional roles.&lt;ref name=no23&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas JH, Schneider S | title = Coevolution of retroelements and tandem zinc finger genes | journal = Genome Res | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 1800–12 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21784874 | pmc = 3205565 | doi = 10.1101/gr.121749.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown in mammals, however, that the diversification of these genes was due to multiple duplication and fixation events in response to new retroviral sequences or their endogenous copies to repress their transcription.&lt;ref name=Kovalskaya06 /&gt; The characteristic of [[placenta]]s being very evolutionary distinct organs between different species has been suggested to result from the [[co-option]] of ERV enhancers. Regulatory mutations, instead of mutations in genes that encode for [[hormone]]s and [[growth factor]]s, support the known evolution of placental morphology, especially since the majority of hormone and growth factor genes are expressed in response to pregnancy, not during placental development. Researchers studied the regulatory landscape of placental development between the rat and mouse, two closely related species. This was done by mapping all regulatory elements of the rat [[trophoblast]] [[stem cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (TSCs) and comparing them to their [[ortholog]]s in mouse TSCs. TSCs were observed because they reflect the initial cells that develop in the fetal placenta. Regardless of their tangible similarities, enhancer and repressed regions were mostly species-specific. However, most promoter sequences were conserved between mouse and rat. In conclusion to their study, researchers proposed that ERVs influenced species-specific placental evolution through mediation of placental growth, [[immunosuppression]], and [[cell fusion]].&lt;ref name="Chuong 325–329"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuong|first=Edward B.|last2=Rumi|first2=M.

Another example of ERV exploiting cellular mechanisms is [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor gene]] (TSG). DNA damage and cellular stress induces the p53 pathway, which results in cell [[apoptosis]]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, thirty-percent of all p53-binding sites were located within copies of a few primate-specific ERV families. A study suggested that this benefits retroviruses because p53's mechanism provides a rapid induction of transcription, which leads to the exit of viral RNA from the host cell.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12/&gt;

== Role in disease ==

The majority of ERVs that occur in vertebrate genomes are ancient, inactivated by mutation, and have reached genetic [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] in their host species. For these reasons, they are extremely unlikely to have negative effects on their hosts except under unusual circumstances. Nevertheless, it is clear from studies in birds and non-human mammal species including mice, cats and [[Koala retrovirus|koalas]], that younger (i.e., more recently integrated) ERVs can be associated with disease. This has led researchers to propose a role for ERVs in several forms of human cancer and [[autoimmune disease]], although conclusive evidence is lacking.&lt;ref name=no1&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bannert, Norbert  |author2=Kurth, Reinhard | title = Retroelements and the human genome: New perspectives on an old relation | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 101 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 14572–9 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15310846 | pmc = 521986 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404838101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10114572B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson PN, Carnegie PR, Martin J, Davari Ejtehadi H, Hooley P, Roden D, Rowland-Jones S, Warren P, Astley J | title = Demystified . . .

In humans, ERVs have been proposed to be involved in [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS). A specific association between MS and the [[ERVWE1]], or "syncytin", gene, which is derived from an ERV insertion, has been reported, along with the presence of an "MS-associated retrovirus" (MSRV), in patients with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2004 it was reported that antibodies to HERVs were found in greater frequency in the [[Serous fluid|sera]] of people with [[schizophrenia]]. Additionally, the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of people with recent onset schizophrenia contained levels of a retroviral marker, [[reverse transcriptase]], four times higher than control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yolken R | title = Viruses and schizophrenia: a focus on herpes simplex virus | journal = Herpes | volume = 11 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 83A–88A |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15319094 | doi =  | url = http://www.stanleylab.org/publications/VIRUSES.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers continue to look at a possible link between HERVs and schizophrenia, with the additional possibility of a triggering [[Pathogenic theory of schizophrenia|infection inducing schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Insanity Virus | author = Fox D | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jun/03-the-insanity-virus | work = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERVs have been found to be associated to disease not only through disease-causing relations, but also through immunity. The frequency of ERVs in long terminal repeats (LTRs) likely correlates to viral adaptations to take advantage of immunity signaling pathways that promote viral transcription and replication. A study done in 2016 investigated the benefit of ancient viral DNA integrated into a host through gene regulation networks induced by [[interferons]], a branch of innate immunity.&lt;ref name=Patience97&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patience|first=Clive|last2=Takeuchi|first2=Yasuhiro|last3=Weiss|first3=Robin A.|date=1997-03-01|title=Infection of human cells by an endogenous retrovirus of pigs|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v3/n3/abs/nm0397-282.html|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=282–6|doi=10.1038/nm0397-282 |pmid=9055854}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[cytokines]] are first to respond to viral infection and are also important in immunosurveillance for malignant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platanias|first=Leonidas C.|date=2005-05-01|title=Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling|url=http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v5/n5/full/nri1604.html|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|volume=5|issue=5|pages=375–386|doi=10.1038/nri1604|pmid=15864272}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERVs are predicted to act as cis-regulatory elements, but much of the adaptive consequences of this for certain physiological functions is still unknown. There is data that supports the general role of ERVs in the regulation of human interferon response, specifically to [[interferon-gamma]] (IFNG). For example, interferon-stimulated genes were found to be greatly enriched with ERVs bound by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) and/or [[Interferon regulatory factor]] (IRF1) in [[CD14+]] macrophages.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

Another idea proposed was that ERVs from the same family played a role in recruiting multiple genes into the same network of regulation. It was found that MER41 elements provided addition redundant regulatory enhancement to the genes located near STAT1 binding sites.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

== Role in medicine ==

=== Porcine endogenous retrovirus ===
For humans, [[porcine]] endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) pose a concern when using porcine tissues and organs in xenotransplantion, the transplanting of living cells, tissues, and organs from an organism of one species to an organism of different species. Although pigs are generally the most suitable donors to treat human organ diseases due practical, financial, safety, and ethical reasons,&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt; PERVs cannot be removed from pigs due to its viral nature of integrating into the host genome and being passed into offspring.  The consequences of cross-species transmission remains unexplored and has very dangerous potential.&lt;ref name=Tang16&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=H.-B.|last2=Ouyang |first2=K.|last3=Rao|first3=G.-B.|last4=Ma|first4=L.|last5=Zhong|first5=H.|last6=Bai |first6=A.|last7=Qin |first7=S. |last8=Chen|first8=F.|last9=Lin|first9=J.|date=2016-01-01|title=Characterization of Complete Genome Sequences of a Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus Isolated From China Bama Minipig Reveals an Evolutionary Time Earlier Than That of Isolates From European Minipigs |url=http://www.transplantation-proceedings.org/article/S0041-1345(15)01173-2/abstract |journal=Transplantation Proceedings |volume=48|issue=1|pages=222–8 |doi=10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.12.005 |pmid=26915872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers indicated that infection of human tissues by PERVs is very possible, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. An immunosuppressed condition could potentially permit a more rapid and tenacious replication of viral DNA, and would later on have less difficulty adapting to human-to-human transmission. Although known infectious pathogens present in the donor organ/tissue can be eliminated by breeding pathogen-free herds, unknown retroviruses can be present in the donor. These retroviruses are often latent and asymptomatic in the donor, but can become active in the recipient. Some examples of endogenous viruses that can infect and multiply in human cells are from baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), and mice.&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt;

There are three different classes of PERVs, PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C. PERV-A and PERV-B are [[polytropic]] and can infect human cells in vitro, while PERV-C is [[ecotropic]] and does not replicate on human cells. The major differences between the classes is in the receptor binding domain of the ''env'' protein and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) that influence the replication of each class. PERV-A and PERV-B display LTRs that have repeats in the [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]] region. However, PERV-A and PERV-C show repeatless LTRs. Researchers found that PERVs in culture actively adapted to the repeat structure of their LTR in order to match the best replication performance a host cell could perform. At the end of their study, researchers concluded that repeatless PERV LTR evolved from the repeat-harboring LTR. This was likely to have occurred from insertional mutation and was proven through use of data on LTR and ''env''/Env. It is thought that the generation of repeatless LTRs could be reflective of an adaptation process of the virus, changing from an exogenous to an endogenous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Tönjes03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tönjes|first=Ralf R.|last2=Niebert|first2=Marcus|date=2003-11-15|title=Relative Age of Proviral Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus Sequences in Sus scrofa Based on the Molecular Clock Hypothesis|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/22/12363|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=77|issue=22|pages=12363–8|doi=10.1128/JVI.77.22.12363-12368.2003|pmc=254287|pmid=14581574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical trial study performed in 1999 sampled 160 patients who were treated with different living pig tissues and observed no evidence of a persistent PERV infection in 97% of the patients for whom a sufficient amount of DNA was available to PCR for amplification of PERV sequences. This study stated that retrospective studies are limited to find the true incidence of infection or associated clinical symptoms, however. It suggested using closely monitored prospective trials, which would provide a more complete and detailed evaluation of the possible cross-species PERV transmission and a comparison of the PERV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradis|first=Khazal|last2=Langford|first2=Gillian|last3=Long|first3=Zhifeng|last4=Heneine|first4=Walid|last5=Sandstrom|first5=Paul|last6=Switzer|first6=William M.|last7=Chapman|first7=Louisa E.|last8=Lockey|first8=Chris|last9=Onions|first9=David|date=1999-08-20|title=Search for Cross-Species Transmission of Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in Patients Treated with Living Pig Tissue|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/285/5431/1236|journal=Science|volume=285|issue=5431|pages=1236–41|doi=10.1126/science.285.5431.1236|pmid=10455044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human endogenous retroviruses ==

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) [[provirus]]es comprise a significant part of the [[human genome]], with approximately 98,000 ERV elements and fragments making up 5–8%.&lt;ref name=Belshaw2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belshaw R, Pereira V, Katzourakis A, Talbot G, Paces J, Burt A, Tristem M | title = Long-term reinfection of the human genome by endogenous retroviruses | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 14 | pages = 4894–9 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15044706 | pmc = 387345 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307800101 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.4894B }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in 2005, no HERVs capable of replication had been identified; all appeared to be defective, containing major deletions or nonsense mutations. This is because most HERVs are merely traces of original viruses, having first integrated millions of years ago.

Human endogenous retroviruses were discovered by accident using a couple of different experiments. Human genomic libraries were screened under low-stringency conditions using probes from animal retroviruses, allowing the isolation and characterization of multiple, though defective, proviruses, that represented various families. Another experiment depended on oligonucleotides with homology to viral primer binding sites.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

HERVs are classified based on their homologies to animal retroviruses. Families belong to Class I are similar in sequence to mammalian type C retroviruses. Families belonging to Class II show homology to mammalian type B and D retroviruses. For both classes, if homologies appear well conserved in the ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'' gene, they are grouped into a [[superfamily (molecular biology)|superfamily]]. There more Class I families known to exist.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

There are two proposals for how HERVs became fixed in the human genome. The first assumes that sometime during human evolution, exogenous progenitors of HERV inserted themselves into germ line cells and then replicated along with the host's genes using and exploiting the host's cellular mechanisms. Because of their distinct genomic structure, HERVs were subjected to many rounds of amplification and transposition, which lead to a widespread distribution of retroviral DNA. The second hypothesis claims the continuous evolution of retro-elements from more simple structured ancestors.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

Nevertheless, one family of viruses has been active since the divergence of [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. This family, termed [[HERV-K]] (HML2), makes up less than 1% of HERV elements but is one of the most studied. There are indications it has even been active in the past few hundred thousand years, e.g., some human individuals carry more copies of HML2 than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belshaw R, Dawson AL, Woolven-Allen J, Redding J, Burt A, Tristem M | title = Genomewide Screening Reveals High Levels of Insertional Polymorphism in the Human Endogenous Retrovirus Family HERV-K(HML2): Implications for Present-Day Activity | journal = J.

This method is more precise in estimating HERV ages and can be used for any HERV insertions. Cross-sectional dating has been used to suggest that two members of HERV-K(HML2), HERV-K106 and HERV-K116, were active in the last 800,000 years and that HERV-K106 may have infected modern humans 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jha AR, Nixon DF, Rosenberg MG, Martin JN, Deeks SG, Hudson RR, Garrison KE, Pillai SK | title = Human Endogenous Retrovirus K106 (HERV-K106) Was Infectious after the Emergence of Anatomically Modern Humans | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e20234 |date=May 2011 | pmid = 21633511 | pmc = 3102101 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020234 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...620234J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of known infectious members of the HERV-K(HML2) family, and the lack of elements with a full coding potential within the published human genome sequence, suggests to some that the family is less likely to be active at present.

MER41.AIM2 is an HERV that regulates the transcription of AIM2 (Absent in Melanoma 2) which encodes for a sensor of foreign cytosolic DNA.  This acts as a binding site for AIM2, meaning that it is necessary for the transcription of AIM2. Researchers had shown this by deleting MER41.AIM2 in HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9, leading to an undetectable transcript level of AIM2 in modified HeLa cells. The control cells, which still contained the MER41.AIM2 ERV, were observed with normal amounts of AIM2 transcript. In terms of immunity, researchers concluded that MER41.AIM2 is necessary for an inflammatory response to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuong|first=Edward B.|last2=Elde|first2=Nels C.|last3=Feschotte|first3=Cédric|date=2016-03-04|title=Regulatory evolution of innate immunity through co-option of endogenous retroviruses|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1083|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6277|pages=1083–7|doi=10.1126/science.aad5497|pmid=26941318|pmc=4887275|bibcode=2016Sci...351.1083C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: A porcine ERV (PERV) Chinese-born [[minipig]] isolate, PERV-A-BM, was sequenced completely and along with different breeds and cell lines in order to understand its genetic variation and evolution. The observed number of nucleotide substitutions and among the different genome sequences helped researchers determine an estimate age that PERV-A-BM was integrated into its host genome, which was found to be of an evolutionary age earlier than the European-born pigs isolates.&lt;ref name=Tang16 /&gt;

=== Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) ===
This technique is used to find histone marks indicative of promoters and enhancers, which are binding sites for DNA proteins, and repressed regions and trimethylation.&lt;ref name="Chuong 325–329"/&gt; DNA methylation has been shown to be vital to maintain silencing of ERVs in mouse somatic cells, while histone marks are vital for the same purpose in [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs) and early embryogenesis.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebollo|first=Rita|last2=Romanish|first2=Mark T.|last3=Mager|first3=Dixie L.|date=2012-01-01|title=Transposable Elements: An Abundant and Natural Source of Regulatory Sequences for Host Genes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155621|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=21–42|doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155621|pmid=22905872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Constructing phylogenies ===
Because most HERVs have no function, are selectively neutral, and are very abundant in primate genomes, they easily serve as phylogenetic markers for linkage analysis. They can be exploited by comparing the integration site polymorphisms or the evolving, proviral, nucleotide sequences of orthologs. To  estimate when integration occurred, researchers used distances from each phylogenetic tree to find the rate of molecular evolution at each particular locus.  It is also useful that ERVs are rich in many species genomes (i.e. plants, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, domestic pets, and livestock) because its application can be used to answer a variety of phylogenetic questions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10254–10260"/&gt;

=== Designating the age of provirus and the time points of species separation events ===
This is accomplished by comparing the different HERV from different evolutionary periods. For example, this study was done for different hominoids, which ranged from humans to apes and to monkeys. This is difficult to do with PERV because of the large diversity present.&lt;ref name="Tönjes03" /&gt;

== Further research ==

=== Epigenetic variability ===
Researchers could analyze individual epigenomes and [[transcriptomes]] to study the reactivation of dormant transposable elements through epigenetic release and their potential associations with human disease and exploring the specifics of gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12 /&gt;

=== Immunological problems of xenotransplantation ===
Little is known about an effective way to overcoming [[hyperacute rejection]] (HAR), which follows the activation of complement initiated by xenoreactive antibodies recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-3galatosyl (alpha-Gal) antigens on the donor epithelium.&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt;

=== Risk factors of HERVs in gene therapy ===
Because retroviruses are able to recombine with each other and with other endogenous DNA sequences, it would be beneficial for gene therapy to explore the potential risks HERVs can cause, if any. Also, this ability of HERVs to recombine can be manipulated for site-directed integration by including HERV sequences in retroviral vectors.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

=== HERV gene expression ===
Researchers believe that RNA and proteins encoded for by HERV genes should continue to be explored for putative function in cell physiology and in pathological conditions. This would make sense to examine in order to more deeply define the biological significance of protein's synthesized.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

The '''experience machine''' or '''pleasure machine''' is a thought experiment put forward by  philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] in his 1974 book  ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, state, and utopia | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-465-09720-0 | pages = 42–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best known attempts to refute ethical [[hedonism]], and does so by imagining a choice between everyday reality and an apparently preferable [[simulated reality]].

If the primary thesis of hedonism is that "pleasure is the good", then any component of life that is not pleasurable does nothing directly to increase one's [[well-being]]. This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a [[thought experiment]]. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated.

==The thought experiment==
Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life?

Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine," which would produce favorable sensations.

===Initial concerns===
Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof.

The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument.

===The argument===
The argument is along these lines:

*P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason not to do x rather than y.
*P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.
*C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&amp;P2)
*P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.
*C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&amp;P3, by [[Modus tollens|MT]])

===Reasons not to plug in===
Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine.

# ''We want to'' do ''certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.''
#* "It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them." (Nozick, 43)
# ''We want to'' be ''a certain sort of person.''
#* "Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob." (Nozick, 43)
# ''Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make).''
#* "There is no ''actual'' contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated." (Nozick, 43)

===Counterarguments===
Psychologist Felipe de Brigard says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by [[status quo bias]], and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this.&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek|author2=[[Peter Singer]]|title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2NeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|date=22 May 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102242-5|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his version:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to [[status quo bias]].&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"/&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Simulated reality in fiction}}
Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story "[[The Chamber of Life]]" by [[Green Peyton Wertenbaker]] ([[:fr:Green Peyton Wertenbaker|fr]]) , published in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in October 1929. The novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' by [[David Foster Wallace]] involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled ''Infinite Jest'' that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sloane |first=Peter |year=2014 |title=The Divided Selves of David Foster Wallace |journal=Tropos |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=67-73 |doi=10.14324/111.2057-2212.011 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Baggott2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jim Baggott]]|title=A Beginner's Guide to Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yAa7kRYiUkC&amp;pg=PT137|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-104232-9|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also is a running theme of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Grau2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Grau|title=Philosophers Explore The Matrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518107-4|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Smith]]'s account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Mr. Reagan.2FCypher|Cypher]] is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing Experience Machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: &lt;blockquote&gt;"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disk]]]]
&lt;!-- Note: per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], topic name should ''not'' be bold because the title of this article is descriptive --&gt;
The formation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] began 4.6 [[bya|billion years ago]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name="Bouvier" /&gt; Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a [[protoplanetary disk]] out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] formed.

This model, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]] was first developed in the 18th century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. Since the dawn of the [[space age]] in the 1950s and the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]] in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.

The Solar System has [[wikt: evolution|evolved]] considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's [[Moon]], may be the result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant collisions]]. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.&lt;ref name="Gomes" /&gt; This [[planetary migration]] is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.

In roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a [[red giant]]), before casting off its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]] and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a [[white dwarf]]. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into [[interstellar space]]. Ultimately, over the course of [[Timeline of the far future|tens of billions]] of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses}}
[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]
Ideas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary | title=Solar system | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar%20system | accessdate=2008-04-15 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current standard [[theory]] for Solar System formation, the [[nebular hypothesis]], has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of [[angular momentum]] when compared to the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael Mark Woolfson | author-link=Michael Woolfson | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume=313 | title=Rotation in the Solar System | issue=1524 |year=1984 | pages=5–18 | bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W | doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100 | title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table | work=New Scientist | author=Nigel Henbest |year=1991 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]'s confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sun: A Biography | author=David Whitehouse | date=2005 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-470-09297-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science | author=Simon Mitton | publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222 | isbn=978-1-85410-961-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] [[B2FH paper|elaborated]] on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called [[red giant]]s [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created many elements]] heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005/&gt;

===Pre-solar nebula===
The nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; The cloud was about 20&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]] (65 light years) across,&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; while the fragments were roughly 1&amp;nbsp;parsec (three and a quarter [[light-year]]s) across.&lt;ref name= "Arizona"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecture 13: The Nebular Theory of the origin of the Solar System|url = http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/nats102/mario/solar_system.html| author=Ann Zabludoff | accessdate=2006-12-27 | date=Spring 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01–0.1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|pc]] (2,000–20,000&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in size.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An astronomical unit, or AU, is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, or about 150 million kilometres.

The remaining 2% of the mass consisted of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were created by [[nucleosynthesis]] in earlier generations of stars.{{sfn|Zeilik|Gregory|1998|p=207}} Late in the life of these stars, they ejected heavier elements into the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=Lineweaver2001 /&gt;
[[File:M42proplyds.jpg|thumb|left|Hubble image of protoplanetary discs in the [[Orion Nebula]], a light-years-wide "stellar nursery" probably very similar to the primordial nebula from which the Sun formed]]
The [[Calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion|oldest inclusions found in meteorites]], thought to trace the first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Bouvier"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Audrey Bouvier |author2=Meenakshi Wadhwa | title=The age of the solar system redefined by the oldest Pb-Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion | journal=Nature Geoscience |year=2010 | doi=10.1038/NGEO941 | volume=3 | pages=637–641|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..637B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as [[iron-60]], that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more [[supernova]]e occurred near the Sun while it was forming.

The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chondrule-forming Shock Fronts in the Solar Nebula: A Possible Unified Scenario for Planet and Chondrite Formation|author1=A.

The [[inner Solar System]], the region of the Solar System inside 4&amp;nbsp;AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[aluminium]]) and rocky [[silicate]]s. These rocky bodies would become the [[terrestrial planet]]s ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 [[Earth mass]]es ({{Earth mass}}) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see [[#Terrestrial planets|Terrestrial planets]] below).&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

When the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting [[drag (physics)|drag]] and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of [[angular momentum]], and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits.

The [[giant planet]]s ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) formed further out, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] elements.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to {{Earth mass|4|link=y}} within about 3&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The combined mass of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is 445.6 Earth masses. The mass of remaining material is ~5.26 Earth masses or 1.1% (see [[Solar System#Notes]] and [[List of Solar System objects by mass]])&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of {{Earth mass|10}}, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.&lt;ref name=ayliffe_bate_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayliffe|first=B.|author2= Bate, M.

T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger [[stellar wind]]s than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong [[solar wind]] had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than {{Earth mass|1}} each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt; The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.&lt;ref name="ddl2011" /&gt;  This means that Uranus and Neptune  may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—and later migrated or were ejected outward (see [[#Planetary migration|Planetary migration]] below).&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return from [[Comet Wild 2]] has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006|author=Emily Lakdawalla|work=The Planetary Society|title=Stardust Results in a Nutshell: The Solar Nebula was Like a Blender | url = http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000735/| accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent evolution==
The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets - the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth.

However, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the [[Kuiper belt]] was much closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] |url = http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html |title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris |work=Personal web site|accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial planets===
At the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kominami"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Tidal Interaction with a Gas Disk on Formation of Terrestrial Planets|author1=Junko Kominami |author2=Shigeru Ida |place=Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo|year=2001 | doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6811|journal=Icarus|
volume=157|issue=1|pages=43–56|bibcode=2002Icar..157...43K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100&amp;nbsp;million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see [[#Moons|Moons]] below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sean C.

One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt; One hypothesis for this "eccentricity dumping" is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The "[[gravitational drag]]" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.&lt;ref name= Kominami /&gt; However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Stages of Planet Formation|author1=Peter Goldreich |author2=Yoram Lithwick |author3=Re'em Sari |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=614|issue=1|pages=497–507|date=10 October 2004|doi=10.1086/423612|bibcode=2004ApJ...614..497G|arxiv = astro-ph/0404240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, is called the [[asteroid belt]]. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of [[planetesimal]]s formed there.

According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the "wrong place".

Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20&amp;nbsp;AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05"&gt;

According to the [[Nice model]], after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05" /&gt;
The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including [[Pluto]], became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into [[mean-motion resonance]]s.&lt;ref name=Malhorta1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=R. Malhotra | title=The Origin of Pluto's Orbit: Implications for the Solar System Beyond Neptune | journal=Astronomical Journal | arxiv=astro-ph/9504036 |year=1995 | volume=110 | pages=420 | doi=10.1086/117532 | bibcode=1995AJ....110..420M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fogg_nelson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the [[Grand tack hypothesis]]), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5&amp;nbsp;AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2011/06/Jupiter%20may%20have%20robbed%20Mars%20of%20mass%20new%20report%20indicates.aspx | title= Jupiter may have robbed Mars of mass, new report indicates | work= Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas | date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Walsh, K.

Impacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994, the [[2009 Jupiter impact event]], the [[Tunguska event]], the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] and the impact feature [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]].

Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, [[comet]]s were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull.

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]] thought to have formed the [[Moon]]]]
Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These [[natural satellite]]s originated by one of three possible mechanisms:
* Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets);
* Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and
* Capture of a passing object.

==Future==
Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning [[stellar evolution|its evolution]] from the [[main sequence]] of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] and into its [[red giant|red-giant]] phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.

===Long-term stability===
The Solar System is [[chaos theory|chaotic]] over million- and billion-year timescales,&lt;ref name=laskar94&gt;{{cite journal

|pages=L9–L12
|year=1994
|bibcode=1994A&amp;A...287L...9L }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]]. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10–20&amp;nbsp;million years (the [[Lyapunov time]]) into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Numerical evidence that the motion of Pluto is chaotic |author1=Gerald Jay Sussman |author2=Jack Wisdom | journal = Science | volume = 241 | pages = 433–437 |year = 1988 | url = http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4864.433 | pmid = 17792606 | issue = 4864 | bibcode=1988Sci...241..433S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Earth's [[axial tilt]], which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon ([[#Moon–ring systems|see below]]), is incomputable from some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the long term evolution of the spin of the Earth|author=O.

The outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2–230&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=hayes07&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wayne B.

In all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—[[ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref name="Stewart1997"&gt;{{cite book

Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.&lt;ref name=hayes07/&gt; Beyond this, within five&amp;nbsp;billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision.

===Moon–ring systems===
The evolution of moon systems is driven by [[tide|tidal forces]]. A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.

The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. Other examples are the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1982MNRAS.201..415G | title=Tidal Heating of Io and orbital evolution of the Jovian satellites | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | author=A. Gailitis | volume=201 | pages=415 |year=1980 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/201.2.415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the larger moons of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Bevilacqua |author2=O.

[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|Neptune and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's [[Roche limit]], tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system.]]
A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).&lt;ref group=note&gt;In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]] causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a [[planetary ring]] system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] of Mars (within 30&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;million years),&lt;ref name=Bills2006&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bruce G.

A third possibility is where the primary and moon are [[tidally locked]] to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to the 2004 arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' spacecraft, the [[rings of Saturn]] were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300&amp;nbsp;million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturn Rings Still A Mystery |work=Popular Mechanics |author=Stefano Coledan |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015710/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from the ''Cassini'' mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10&amp;nbsp;km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Saturn's recycled rings | journal=Astronomy Now| pages=9 |date=February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages.

Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into [[carbon]] will begin, leading to a [[helium flash]]; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11&amp;nbsp;times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770&amp;nbsp;K. The Sun will become a [[Horizontal branch|horizontal giant]], burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100&amp;nbsp;million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant]]. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Schroder2008/&gt; This phase lasts about 30&amp;nbsp;million years, after which, over the course of a further 100,000&amp;nbsp;years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a [[planetary nebula]]. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.&lt;ref name=nebula&gt;{{cite web | author=Bruce Balick | title=Planetary nebulae and the future of the Solar System | work=Personal web site | url = http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/| accessdate=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M57 The Ring Nebula.JPG|thumb|The [[Ring nebula]], a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will become]]
This is a relatively peaceful event, nothing akin to a [[supernova]], which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Gaseous Metal Disk Around a White Dwarf|author1=B.

Initially, this white dwarf may be 100&amp;nbsp;times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.&lt;ref name="future-sun"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard W.

As the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss. All remaining planets' orbits will expand; if Venus, Earth, and Mars still exist, their orbits will lie roughly at {{convert|1.4|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, {{convert|1.9|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, and {{convert|2.8|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}. They and the other remaining planets will become dark, frigid hulks, completely devoid of any form of life.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; They will continue to orbit their star, their speed slowed due to their increased distance from the Sun and the Sun's reduced gravity.

==Galactic interaction==
[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|left|thumb|Location of the Solar System within the Milky Way]]
The Solar System travels alone through the [[Milky Way]] in a circular orbit approximately 30,000&amp;nbsp;light years from the [[Galactic Centre]]. Its speed is about 220&amp;nbsp;km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the [[galactic year]], is in the range of 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml|work=The Physics Factbook (self-published)| author=Stacy Leong| editor=Glenn Elert |year=2002|title=Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year) | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of [[mass extinction]]s observed in the Earth's [[fossil record]]. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-03-25
| publisher = The Scientific Research Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's [[spiral arms]]. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright [[blue giant]]s, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as [[supernovae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Extinctions and The Sun's Encounters with Spiral Arms|author1=Erik M.

===Galactic collision and planetary disruption===
{{Main article|Andromeda–Milky Way collision}}
Although the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as [[tidal force]]s distort their outer arms into vast [[tidal tails]]. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%,&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; the galaxies' [[supermassive black hole]]s will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant [[elliptical galaxy]]. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a [[Starburst galaxy|starburst]].&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an [[active galactic nucleus]]. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.&lt;ref name=cain&gt;{{cite web|title=When Our Galaxy Smashes Into Andromeda, What Happens to the Sun?|author=Fraser Cain|work=Universe Today|url = http://www.universetoday.com/2007/05/10/when-our-galaxy-smashes-into-andromeda-what-happens-to-the-sun/|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Collision Between The Milky Way And Andromeda |author1=J. T. Cox |author2=Abraham Loeb | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |arxiv=0705.1170 |year=2007 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13048.x|volume=386|issue=1|pages=461–474 | bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..461C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html |author=NASA|title=NASA's Hubble Shows Milky Way is Destined for Head-On Collision |work=NASA |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time, the [[Cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability]] of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the [[Big Crunch]] or [[Big Rip]] scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1&amp;nbsp;quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an open universe|author=Freeman Dyson|place=Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton New Jersey|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51 | pages=447–460|date=July 1979 | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 |accessdate=2008-04-02 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447|issue=3 | bibcode=1979RvMP...51..447D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{wide image|Solar Life Cycle.svg|600px|alt=Projected timeline of the Sun's life. From Formation To 14Gy}}
The time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using [[radiometric dating]]. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years old. The [[oldest rock|oldest known mineral grains]] on [[Earth]] are approximately 4.4&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=Wilde&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=175–8 | title= Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago |author1=Simon A. Wilde |author2=John W. Valley |author3=William H. Peck |author4=Colin M. Graham | doi=10.1038/35051550 | url = http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf | format=PDF |year= 2001 | pmid=11196637 | issue=6817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by [[erosion]], [[volcanism]], and [[plate tectonics]]. To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use [[meteorite]]s, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]]) are found to have an age of 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date=2000 |author=Gary Ernst Wallace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Earth's Place in the Solar System|title=Earth Systems: Processes and Issues|pages=45–58|isbn=0-521-47895-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10&amp;nbsp;million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

'''Globalism''' refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. The term is used by detractors of [[globalization]] such as [[right-wing populist]] movements. While primarily associated with [[world-system]]s, other things with global reach have also been so described.

Historically, it has been associated with international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and also sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of "[[nation building]]" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1992 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.

== Definitions and interpretations ==
[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines ''globalism'', "at least in its more specific use, ... as the dominant ideology and [[subjectivity]] associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.

Alternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.&lt;ref name="Nye 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x | volume=9 | title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory | journal=International Studies Review | pages=173–196 | last1 = Martell | first1 = Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).

During the election and presidency of United States president [[Donald Trump]], Trump and members of his administration used the term ''globalist'' on multiple occasions. Critics claimed that the administration used the term as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Dog-whistle politics|"dog whistle"]] term referring to members of a [[New antisemitism#Anti-globalization movement|Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/globalism-right-trump.html|title=Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump|last=Stack|first=Liam|date=14 November 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/04/06/news-opinion/politics/stephen-bannon-called-jared-kushner-a-globalist-heres-why-the-term-makes-some-jews-uneasy|title=Stephen Bannon reportedly called Jared Kushner a ‘globalist.’ Here’s why the term makes some Jews uneasy.|last=Sales|first=Ben|date=6 April 2017|website=www.jta.org|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/759476/mick-mulvaney-throws-antisemitic-dog-whistle-into-fond-farewell-message-gary-cohn|title=Mick Mulvaney throws an 'anti-Semitic dog whistle' into his fond farewell message to Gary Cohn|last=Weber|first=Peter|date=7 March 2018|work=The Week|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bannon-s-revenge-how-globalism-went-mainstream-ideology-far-right-ncna860221|title=Opinion {{!}} Brian Levin: How globalism became a dirty word in the Trump White House (and America)|last=Levin|first=Brian|date=1 April 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-anti-semitic-globalist-koch-1052375|title=Donald Trump keeps calling adversaries "globalists," despite warnings it's anti-Semitic|last=Goodkind|first=Nicole|date=1 August 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
The word itself came into widespread usage, first and foremost in the United States, from the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ''globalism'' in American-English corpus, 1800–2000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=17&amp;smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 24 October 2014 }}&lt;p&gt;Compare this with ''globalism'' in the [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=18&amp;smoothing=0 British-English corpus], where its appearance is later and much more muted.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history.&lt;ref name="Leffler 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|2010|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]'s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] put it in February 1948: "[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. […] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity".&lt;ref name="DoS 524"&gt;{{Harvnb|DoS|1948|p=[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2.p0034 524]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; America's allies and foes in [[Eurasia]] were suffering the dreadful effects of World War II at this time.

In their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|Kolko|1972|p=}}.&lt;p&gt;One American historian has gone as far as to describe this particular American version of globalism as ''visionary'', in order to highlight its potently ideological nature—indeed, "Washington's most impressive Cold War ideological achievement". Visionary globalism was a far-reaching conception of "American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking". And "integrating everything" crucially meant global ''economic'' integration, which had collapsed under the blows of World War I and the Great Depression. ({{Harvnb|Peck|2006|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the United States to use the term ''[[economic integration]]'' in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) did so at this time: one John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Treasury Department, towards the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Machlup 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, ''economic integration'' was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches.&lt;ref name="Machlup 11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul G. Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]], then head of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]], made the most marked use of the term in a 1949 speech to the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].&lt;ref name="Machlup 11" /&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' put it,

{{Quote| Mr Hoffmann used the word 'integration' fifteen times or almost once to every hundred words of his speech. It is a word that rarely if ever has been used by European statesmen having to do with the Marshall Plan to describe what should happen to Europe's economies. It was remarked that no such term or goal was included in the commitments the European nations gave in agreeing to the Marshall Plan. Consequently it appeared to the Europeans that "integration" was an American doctrine that had been superimposed upon the mutual engagements made when the Marshall Plan began&amp;nbsp;…&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Veseth|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8u99zWdAElUC&amp;pg=PA170 170–1]}}, where the ''Times'' article is reprinted.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While ideologies of the global have a long history, globalism emerged as a dominant set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of [[globalization]] intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In their recent writings, [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Steger|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hanford Site''' is a decommissioned [[Nuclear technology|nuclear]] production complex operated by the United States federal government on the [[Columbia River]] in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The site has been known by many names, including '''Hanford Project''', '''Hanford Works''', '''Hanford Engineer Works''' and '''Hanford Nuclear Reservation'''. Established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], south-central Washington, the site was home to the [[B Reactor]], the first full-scale [[plutonium]] production [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |title=B Reactor |url=https://www.energy.gov/about/breactor.htm |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080017/http://www.energy.gov/about/breactor.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], tested at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity site]], and in [[Fat Man]], the bomb [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] over [[Nagasaki]], Japan.

During the [[Cold War]], the project expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large [[Nuclear reprocessing|plutonium processing]] complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the more than 60,000 weapons built for the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |title=Hanford Site: Hanford Overview |url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/HanfordOverview |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68BrRtsd7?url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/HanfordOverview |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arsenal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Science Watch: Growing Nuclear Arsenal |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71F38F93BA15757C0A961948260 |date=April 28, 1987 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear technology]] developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of [[radioactive contamination|radioactive materials]] into the air and the Columbia River.

In 1989, the State of Washington (Dept. of Ecology), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and US Department of Energy (DOE) entered into the [https://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/TriParty/TheAgreement Tri-Party Agreement] which sets targets, or milestones, for cleanup.

== Early history ==
The confluence of the [[Yakima River|Yakima]], [[Snake River|Snake]], and Columbia rivers has been a meeting place for [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] for centuries. The archaeological record of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] habitation of this area stretches back over ten thousand years. Tribes and nations including the [[Yakama]], [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]], and [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]] used the area for hunting, fishing, and gathering plant foods.&lt;ref name="HistoryLink"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hanford Reach National Monument |website=HistoryLink.org: The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7438 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanford [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] have identified numerous Native American sites, including "pit house villages, open campsites, fish farming sites, hunting/kill sites, [[game drive complex]]es, quarries, and spirit quest sites",&lt;ref name="Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12"/&gt; and two archaeological sites were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="nris1"&gt;Hanford Island Archaeological Site (NRHP #76001870) and Hanford North Archaeological District (NRHP #76001871). {{NRISref|2007a|dateform=mdy}} (See also the commercial site [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/wa/Benton/state.html National Register of Historic Places].)&lt;/ref&gt; Native American use of the area continued into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, even as the tribes were relocated to [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. The [[Wanapum]] people were never forced onto a reservation, and they lived along the Columbia River in the [[Priest Rapids|Priest Rapids Valley]] until 1943.&lt;ref name="Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12"/&gt; Settlers moved into the region in the 1860s, initially along the Columbia River south of Priest Rapids. They established farms and orchards supported by small-scale irrigation projects and railroad transportation, with small town centers at [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]], and [[Richland, Washington|Richland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=On the Home Front: The Cold War Legacy of the Hanford Nuclear Site |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |location=Lincoln, NE |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8032-7101-8 |pages=16–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
{{Main|Manhattan Project}}
During [[World War II]], the [[S-1 Section]] of the federal [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium. The research contract was awarded to scientists at the [[University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory]] (Met Lab). At the time, plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a [[University of California]] laboratory. The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain-reacting "piles" of [[uranium]] to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium. The program was accelerated in 1942, as the United States government became concerned that scientists in [[Nazi Germany]] were developing a nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.10|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Site selection ===

[[Image:Hanford High School.jpg|thumb|right|Hanford High after abandonment]]
In September 1942, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] placed the newly formed [[Manhattan Project]] under the command of [[Leslie Groves|Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves]], charging him with the construction of industrial-size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium.&lt;ref name="Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12"/&gt; Groves recruited the [[DuPont|DuPont Company]] to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont recommended that it be located far away from the existing uranium production facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. The ideal site was described by these criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=Legend and Legacy: Fifty Years of Defense Production at the Hanford Site |publisher=Westinghouse Hanford Company |year=1992 |location=Richland, Washington |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A large and remote tract of land
* A "hazardous manufacturing area" of at least {{convert|12|by|16|mi|km|0}}
* Space for laboratory facilities at least {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} from the nearest reactor or separations plant
* No towns of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;people closer than {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* No main highway, railway, or employee village closer than {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* A clean and abundant water supply
* A large electric power supply
* Ground that could bear heavy loads.

In December 1942, Groves dispatched his assistant [[Franklin Matthias|Colonel Franklin T. Matthias]] and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that Hanford was "ideal in virtually all respects", except for the farming towns of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Matthias |last=Franklin |author-link=Franklin Matthias |title=Hanford Engineer Works, Manhattan Engineer District: Early History |work=Speech to the Technical Exchange Program |date=January 14, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Groves visited the site in January 1943 and established the Hanford Engineer Works, codenamed "Site&amp;nbsp;W". The federal government quickly acquired the land under its war powers authority&lt;ref&gt;Second War Powers Act 56 Stat. 176 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; and relocated some 1,500&amp;nbsp;residents of Hanford, White Bluffs, and nearby settlements, as well as the Wanapum people, Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Nez Perce Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Department of Energy: Hanford |title=Department of Energy's Tribal Program: The DOE Tribal Program at Hanford |url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/inp |publisher=DOE Hanford.gov |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Kate |title=Plutopia: nuclear families, atomic cities, and the great Soviet and American plutonium disasters |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-985576-6 |pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
[[Image:Hanford B reactor construction.jpg|thumb|right|[[B Reactor]] construction (1944)]]

The Hanford Engineer Works (HEW) broke ground in March 1943 and immediately launched a massive and technically challenging construction project.&lt;ref name=HistoryLink2&gt;{{cite web |last=Oldham |first=Kit |title=Construction of massive plutonium production complex at Hanford begins in March 1943 |publisher=History Link |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5363 |date=March 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont advertised for workers in newspapers for an unspecified "war construction project" in southeastern Washington, offering "attractive scale of wages" and living facilities.&lt;ref name="milwaukeesentinel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UEMxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LQ4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7157%2C1687590 |title=Needed by E.

The construction workers (who reached a peak of 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite. The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.

Construction of the nuclear facilities proceeded rapidly. Before the end of the war in August 1945, the HEW built 554&amp;nbsp;buildings at Hanford, including three nuclear reactors (105-B, 105-D, and 105-F) and three plutonium processing canyons (221-T, 221-B, and 221-U), each {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long.

To receive the radioactive wastes from the chemical separations process, the HEW built "tank farms" consisting of 64&amp;nbsp;single-shell underground waste tanks (241-B, 241-C, 241-T, and 241-U).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.21–1.23|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project required {{convert|386|mi|km|0}} of roads, {{convert|158|mi|km|0}} of railway, and four electrical substations.

=== Plutonium production ===
{{further|B Reactor}}
The [[B Reactor]] (105-B) at Hanford was the first large-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. It was designed and built by [[DuPont]] based on an experimental design by [[Enrico Fermi]], and originally operated at 250&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|megawatts (thermal)]]. The reactor was [[graphite]] moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a {{convert|28|by|36|ft|sp=us|adj=on}}, {{convert|1200|ST|t|adj=on}} graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004&amp;nbsp;aluminium tubes.&lt;ref name="page115130"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.15, 1.30|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|Two hundred short tons}} (180&amp;nbsp;t) of uranium slugs, {{convert|1.625|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|8|in|cm}} long, sealed in aluminium cans went into the tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=David |last2=O'Conner |first2=Georganne |title=History of the Hanford Site 1943–1990 |url=http://ecology.pnnl.gov/library/History/Hanford-History-All.pdf |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooling water]] was pumped through the aluminium tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of {{convert|30,000|USgal|L}} per minute.&lt;ref name="page115130"/&gt;
[[File:Hanford B Reactor.jpg|thumb|left|The B Reactor during construction]]
Construction on B Reactor began in August 1943 and was completed on September 13, 1944. The reactor went [[critical mass|critical]] in late September and, after overcoming [[neutron poison]]ing, produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.22–1.27|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium was produced in the Hanford reactors when a [[uranium-238]] atom in a fuel slug absorbed a [[neutron]] to form [[uranium-239]]. U-239 rapidly undergoes [[beta decay]] to form [[neptunium-239]], which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form [[plutonium-239]]. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called "canyons" that were about {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} away. A series of chemical processing steps separated the small amount of plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] on February 5, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Findlay |first=John |author2=Bruce Hevly |title=Nuclear Technologies and Nuclear Communities: A History of Hanford and the Tri-Cities, 1943–1993 |publisher=Hanford History Project, Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington |place=Seattle, WA |year=1995 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The material was used in [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]], the first nuclear explosion, on July 16, 1945.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Two identical reactors, D Reactor and F reactor, came online in December 1944 and February 1945, respectively. By April 1945, shipments of plutonium were headed to Los Alamos every five days, and Hanford soon provided enough material for the bombs tested at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] and dropped over [[Fat Man|Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.27|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, the Manhattan Project maintained a top secret classification. Until news arrived of the bomb dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], fewer than one percent of Hanford's workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.22|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Groves noted in his memoirs that "We made certain that each member of the project thoroughly understood his part in the total effort; that, and nothing more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Groves |first=Leslie |title=Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1983 |location=New York, NY |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially six reactors or "piles" were proposed, when the plutonium was to be used in the gun-type [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] bomb. In mid-1944 a simple gun-type bomb was found to be impractical for plutonium, and the more advanced [[Fat Man]] bomb, an implosion device, required less plutonium.&lt;ref name="WisconsinProject"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Weapons Primer |url=https://www.wisconsinproject.org/nuclear-weapons/ |website=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control |publisher=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of piles was reduced to four and then three; and the number of chemical separation plants from four to three.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nichols |first1=Kenneth |year=1987 |title=The Road to Trinity |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-688-06910-X |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}

=== Technological innovations ===
In the short time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances. As no one had ever built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, [[DuPont]] engineers installed [[ammonia]]-based [[refrigeration]] systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.&lt;ref name=sanger&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanger |first=S. L. |title=Working on the Bomb: an Oral History of WWII Hanford |publisher=Continuing Education Press, Portland State University |place=Portland, Oregon }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

Another difficulty the engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], used as a gasket material, and [[closed-circuit television]], used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;{{rp|interview with Generaux}}

== Cold War expansion ==
[[Image:Hanford D Reactor.jpg|thumb|right|Decommissioning D Reactor]]

In September 1946, the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]] assumed management of the Hanford Works under the supervision of the newly created [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. As the [[Cold War]] began, the United States faced a new strategic threat in the rise of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet nuclear weapons program]].

=== Decommissioning ===
Most of the reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, [[N Reactor]], continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]] (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=City of Richland |title=Cocooning Hanford Reactors |date=December 2, 2003 |url=http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/richland/hanford/index.cfm?PageNum=12 |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611213440/http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/richland/hanford/index.cfm?PageNum=12 |archivedate=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours.

== Later operations ==
[[Image:Hanford Site sign.jpg|thumb|right|Highway sign on a road entering the Hanford Site]]

The [[United States Department of Energy]] assumed control of the Hanford Site in 1977. Although uranium enrichment and plutonium breeding were slowly phased out, the nuclear legacy left an indelible mark on the Tri-Cities. Since World War&amp;nbsp;II, the area had developed from a small farming community to a booming "Atomic Frontier" to a powerhouse of the nuclear-industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hevly |first=Bruce |author2=John Findlay |title=The Atomic West |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1998 |location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of federal investment created a community of highly skilled scientists and engineers. As a result of this concentration of specialized skills, the Hanford Site was able to diversify its operations to include scientific research, test facilities, and commercial nuclear power production.

{{as of|2013}}, operational facilities located at the Hanford Site included:
* The [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], owned by the Department of Energy and operated by [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]
* The [[Fast Flux Test Facility]] (FFTF), a national research facility in operation from 1980 to 1992 whose last fuel was removed in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanfordnews.com/2009/06/03/13506/fast-flux-test-facility-shutdown.html |title=Fast Flux Test Facility shutdown completed at Hanford |author=Cary, Annette |date=June 3, 2009 |publisher=Hanford News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117151138/http://www.hanfordnews.com/2009/06/03/13506/fast-flux-test-facility-shutdown.html |archivedate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Energy and its contractors offer tours of the site. The tours are free, can be reserved in  advance via the department's web site, and are limited to U.S. citizens at least 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Energy / Hanford.gov |title=Tour Information |url=https://www.hanford.gov/c.cfm/publicTours |accessdate=June 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Between 2009 and 2018, approximately 80,000 people visited the site, bringing an estimated annual tourist income of two million dollars to the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

== Environmental concerns ==
[[Image:Hare HanfordReach.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hanford Reach]] of the [[Columbia River]], where radioactivity was released from 1944 to 1971]]

A huge volume of water from the Columbia River was required to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors.
As much as 75,000 gallons per minute was diverted from the Columbia River to cool the reactor.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before its release into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as [[retention basin]]s for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. The federal government kept knowledge about these radioactive releases secret.&lt;ref name="HHIN"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Hanford Health Information Network |title=An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects |url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106001013/http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation was later measured {{convert|200|mi}} downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 |date=July 17, 1992 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plutonium separation process resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="HHIN"/&gt; [[Downwinders]] were exposed to [[radionuclides]], particularly [[iodine-131]], with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides entered the food chain via [[dairy cows]] grazing on contaminated fields; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed radioactive food and milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the "[[Green Run]]" released 8,000&amp;nbsp;curies of iodine-131 over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=On the Home Front: The Cold War Legacy of the Hanford Nuclear Site |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |location=Lincoln, NE |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8032-7101-8 |pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities who depended on the river for their customary diets.&lt;ref name="HHIN"/&gt; A U.S. government report released in 1992 estimated that 685,000 curies of radioactive iodine-131 had been released into the river and air from the Hanford site between 1944 and 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/13/nation/na-hanford13 |author=Martin, Hugo |title=Nuclear site now a tourist hot spot |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |date=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Salmon at Hanford Site.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salmon]] spawning in the Hanford Reach near the H-Reactor]]
Beginning in the 1960s, scientists with the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]] published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, and there were protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to an article in the Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000&amp;nbsp;pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations.&lt;ref name="HHIN"/&gt; The [[Washington State Department of Health]] collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases,&lt;ref name="HHIN"/&gt; particularly forms of [[Thyroid disease]].&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; A [[mass tort]] lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government spent many years in the court system.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; In 2005, two of six plaintiffs who went to trial were awarded $500,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McClure |first=Robert |title=Downwinders' court win seen as 'great victory' |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/225306_downwinders21.html |date=May 21, 2005 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2015, the Department of Energy resolved the final cases.  They paid more than $60 million in legal fees and $7 million in damages.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Boyle |first1=Rebecca |title=Greetings from Isotopia  |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=3 |pages=26–35 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/greetings-from-isotopia |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment: "The highest tritium concentration detected in riverbank springs during 2002 was 58,000 pCi/L (2,100 Bq/L) at the Hanford Townsite. The highest iodine-129 concentration of 0.19 pCi/L (0.007 Bq/L) was also found in a Hanford Townsite spring. The WHO guidelines for radionuclides in drinking-water limits levels of iodine-129 at 1 Bq/L, and tritium at 10,000 Bq/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiological Aspects (water sanitation) |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/GDW9rev1and2.pdf |website=www.who.int |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of radionuclides including tritium, technetium-99, and iodine-129 in riverbank springs near the Hanford Townsite have generally been increasing since 1994. This is an area where a major [[Groundwater#Pollution|groundwater plume]] from the 200 East Area intercepts the river&amp;nbsp;... Detected radionuclides include strontium-90, technetium-99, iodine-129, uranium-234, −235, and −238, and tritium. Other detected contaminants include arsenic, chromium, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, and sulfate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-6415Rev17.pdf |title=Hanford Site National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Characterization |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |id=PNNL-6415 Rev. 17 |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Governor [[Jay Inslee]] announced that a tank storing [[radioactive waste]] at the site had been leaking liquids on average of 150 to 300 gallons per year. He said that though the leak posed no immediate health risk to the public, it should not be an excuse for not doing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tank storing radioactive waste leaking in Washington |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/15/us/washington-tank-leak/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2013, the Governor stated that "6 more tanks at Hanford site" were "leaking radioactive waste"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Washington Gov.

{{As of|2013}}, there are 177 tanks at Hanford, 149 of which have a single shell. Historically single shell tanks were used for storing radioactive liquid waste and designed to last 20 years. By 2005, some liquid waste was transferred from single shell tanks to (safer) double shell tanks. A substantial amount of residue remains in the older single shell tanks with one containing an estimated 447,000 gallons (1,700 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of radioactive sludge, for example. It is believed that up to six of these "empty" tanks are leaking. Two tanks are reportedly leaking at a rate of 300 gallons (1,136 liters) per year each, while the remaining four tanks are leaking at a rate of 15 gallons (57 liters) per year each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363719/gov-6-underground-hanford-nuclear-tanks-leaking |title=Gov: 6 underground Hanford nuclear tanks leaking &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Eric |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/23/us-usa-nuclear-leak-idUSBRE91L19G20130223 |title=Radioactive waste leaking from six tanks at Washington state nuclear site |publisher=Reuters |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupational health concerns ===
Since 1987, workers have reported exposure to harmful vapors after working around underground nuclear storage tanks, with no solution found. More than 40 workers in 2014 alone reported smelling vapors and became ill with "nosebleeds, headaches, watery eyes, burning skin, contact dermatitis, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, coughing, sore throats, expectorating, dizziness and nausea,&amp;nbsp;... Several of these workers have long-term disabilities." Doctors checked workers and cleared them to return to work. Monitors worn by tank workers have found no samples with chemicals close to the federal limit for occupational exposure.&lt;ref name=Katu&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/Washington-to-sue-over-nuclear-sites-tank-vapors--283276831.html |title=Washington to sue over nuclear site's tank vapors |author=Nicholas K. Geranios |publisher=Associated Press  |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] ordered the facility to rehire a contractor and pay $220,000 in back wages for firing them for [[whistleblowing]] on safety concerns at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=26571 |title=OSHA orders Hanford nuclear facility contractor to reinstate worker fired for raising environmental safety concerns |publisher=OSHA |date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2014, [[Washington Attorney General]] Bob Ferguson said the state planned to sue the DOE and its contractor to protect workers from hazardous vapors at Hanford. A 2014 report by the DOE [[Savannah River National Laboratory]] initiated by 'Washington River Protection Solutions' found that DOE's methods to study vapor releases were inadequate, particularly, that they did not account for short but intense vapor releases. They recommended "proactively sampling the air inside tanks to determine its chemical makeup; accelerating new practices to prevent worker exposures; and modifying medical evaluations to reflect how workers are exposed to vapors".&lt;ref name=Katu/&gt;

While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s and many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, there are continued concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River and about workers' health and safety.&lt;ref name=Troubled/&gt;

The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the {{convert|53,000,000|USgal}} of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177&amp;nbsp;underground tanks. By 1998, about a third of these tanks had leaked waste into the soil and groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wald |first=Matthew |title=Panel Details Management Flaws at Hanford Nuclear Waste Site |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D71638F935A25752C0A96E958260 |date=January 16, 1998 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085657/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D71638F935A25752C0A96E958260 |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, most of the liquid waste had been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, {{convert|2,800,000|USgal}} of liquid waste, together with {{convert|27,000,000|USgal}} of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks.&lt;ref name="Ecology"/&gt; DOE lacks information about the extent to which the 27 double-shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion.

Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium-239 has a [[half-life]] of 24,100 years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to cease its radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Laura A. |last=Hanson |publisher=University of Idaho |title=Radioactive Waste Contamination of Soil and Groundwater at the Hanford Site |date=November 2000 |url=http://www.agls.uidaho.edu/etox/resources/case_studies/HANFORD.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227230947/http://www.agls.uidaho.edu/etox/resources/case_studies/HANFORD.PDF |archivedate=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gephart |first=Roy |title=Hanford: A Conversation About Nuclear Waste and Cleanup |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2003 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Department of Energy awarded a $4.3 billion contract to [[Bechtel]], a San Francisco-based construction and engineering firm, to build a [[Radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification]] plant to combine the dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable.

In May 2007, state and federal officials began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as [[groundwater remediation]]. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600&amp;nbsp;million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy was in violation of environmental laws.&lt;ref name=Troubled/&gt; They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/environment/archives/135723.asp |title=State steps back from brink of Hanford suit |last=Stiffler |first=Lisa |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During excavations from 2004 to 2007 a sample of purified plutonium was uncovered inside a safe in a waste trench, and has been dated to about the 1940s, making it the second-oldest sample of purified plutonium known to exist. Analyses published in 2009 concluded that the sample originated at Oak Ridge, and was one of several sent to Hanford for optimization tests of the T-Plant until Hanford could produce its own plutonium. Documents refer to such a sample, belonging to "Watt's group", which was disposed of in its safe when a radiation leak was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i05/8705notw7.html Chemical &amp; Engineering News: Antique Plutonium: Manhattan Project-era plutonium is found in a glass jug during Hanford Site cleanup]{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Historic-plutonium-found-in-safe-at-Hanford-1298348.php |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |author=Annette Cary |title=Historic plutonium found in safe at Hanford |date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postwar the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] took over, and then the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]]. Since 1977, Hanford operations are directed by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

'''Jack Firestein''' (1917–2004) was British Socialist and Labour activist.

==Life==
He was born in [[Whitechapel]], London, England, to an eastern European Jewish family, he left school when he was 14 to follow his father as a tailor, he later became a bookseller, a profession he continued most of his life. In the early 1930s Firestein joined [[the Communist Party]].  In 1936, he was involved in the '[[Battle of Cable Street]]', when [[Oswald Mosley]]'s Blackshirts were routed by a mobilisation of East End workers. In the [[Second World War]] he joined the [[Royal Fusiliers]] who were involved in the Italian campaigns in [[Italy]]. He was seriously injured when a bullet passed through his body in the battle of [[Anzio]], where he was taken prisoner by the Germans. Jack was subsequently awarded the [[Military Medal]].

After the war he went back to the book trade and in the 1950s he ran the [[Unity Theatre, London]] Folk Club in London for more than 16 years, until the theatre was burnt down in 1975.  He also worked as a chauffeur for [[Clive Jenkins]] a British trade union leader for many years.  He left the Communist Party in 1956 after the [[Soviet Union]] suppression of the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] that year.

He joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and remained a member until his death, He ran an open-air book stall outside of the headquarters of Camden Labour Party – although his disillusionment with the party led him to join the then recently formed [[Respect Party]] without renouncing his Labour Party membership.  He was deeply involved with his local Neighbourhood Advice Centre as a trustee on the management board, and he also dedicated many hours to helping others with welfare problems.

In 2009, Chris Reeves, a London filmmaker of Platform films, made a film remembrance of his life entitled "Only a Bookseller". It was accepted into the 2010 [[Canadian Labour International Film Festival (CLiFF)]].

In economics, the '''Jevons paradox''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|v|ə|n|z}}; sometimes '''Jevons effect''') occurs when [[technological change|technological progress]] or government policy increases the [[efficiency]] with which a [[resource (economics)|resource]] is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that resource rises due to increasing [[demand (economics)|demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer |first1=Diana |last2=Papp |first2=Kathryn |title=Book Review Perspectives: The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy |date=March 18, 2009 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529111127/http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal|last=York |first=Richard |title=Ecological paradoxes: William Stanley Jevons and the paperless office |journal=Human Ecology Review |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=143–147 |url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her132/york.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, governments and [[environmentalist]]s generally assume that efficiency gains will lower [[resource consumption]], ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.&lt;ref name=Alcott1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.020|last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=Jevons' paradox |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=9–21 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905001084 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=[[Macmillan and Company]] |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |chapter=VII |oclc=464772008 |url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:AAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |year=2008 |publisher=Earthscan |pages=7–78 | editor=JM Polimeni |editor2=K Mayumi |editor3=M Giampietro |chapter=Historical Overview of the Jevons paradox in the Literature |isbn=1-84407-462-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effects]] from improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates [[economic growth]], further increasing the demand for resources.  The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]]. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue [[sustainability]] by increasing energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt; Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wackernagel |first=Mathis |first2=William |last2=Rees |year=1997 |title=Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: Economics from an ecological footprint perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as [[cap and trade]] or [[green taxes]]) can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freire-González|first1=Jaume|last2=Puig-Ventosa|first2=Ignasi|title=Energy Efficiency Policies and the Jevons Paradox |journal=International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy |date=2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=69–79 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eco/journ2/2015-01-06.html |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|alt=Engraving of William Stanley Jevons|[[William Stanley Jevons]], after whom the paradox is named]]

The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]''. Jevons observed that [[England]]'s consumption of [[coal]] soared after [[James Watt]] introduced the [[Watt steam engine]], which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] from [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;

At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, [[water use|water usage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumont|first1=A.|last2=Mayor|first2=B.|last3=López-Gunn|first3=E.|title=Is the Rebound Effect or Jevons Paradox a Useful Concept for Better Management of Water Resources?

It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"/&gt;

Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for fuel.&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small |first= Kenneth A. |author2=Kurt Van Dender |title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966–2001 |journal=Policy and Economics | publisher=University of California Energy Institute, UC Berkeley | date = 2005-09-21 |volume= |series= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1h6141nj |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the [[cost]] of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a [[Goods and services|good or service]] will increase the quantity demanded (the [[law of demand]]). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]], and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the [[price elasticity of demand]] for the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Nathan W.|last2=Gillingham|first2=Kenneth|title=The Microeconomic Theory of the Rebound Effect and Its Welfare Implications|journal=Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists|date=1 March 2015|volume=2|issue=1|pages=133–159|doi=10.1086/680256|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680256|accessdate=4 February 2018|issn=2333-5955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is [[price elastic]]), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

==Khazzoom–Brookes postulate==
{{Main|Khazzoom–Brookes postulate}}

In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's [[World energy consumption|energy use]]. Brookes, then chief economist at the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the [[California Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D.|title=The Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth|journal=The Energy Journal|date=October 1992|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–148|jstor=41322471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|date=19 July 1999|title=Does energy efficiency save energy? The debate and its consequences|journal=Applied Energy|volume=63|issue=3|pages=209–226|issn=0306-2619|doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the ''Khazzoom–Brookes postulate'', and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical [[Economic growth|growth theory]] (the mainstream economic theory of [[capital accumulation]], [[Technological change|technological progress]] and [[long-run]] economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the [[neoclassical growth model]] under a wide range of assumptions.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrell|first1=Steve|title=Jevons’ Paradox revisited: The evidence for backfire from improved energy efficiency|journal=Energy Policy|date=April 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1456–1469|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.12.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007428|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saunders, increased [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5 | surname=Greening| first=Lorna | title=Energy efficiency and consumption—the rebound effect—a survey |author2=David L. Greene |author3=Carmen Difiglio| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=389–401 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issue=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

==Energy conservation policy==
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
{{Sustainable energy}}

There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]] policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many [[environmental economists]], doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards [[sustainability]], and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_owen|title=Annals of Environmentalism: The Efficiency Dilemma|last=Owen|first=David|date=December 20, 2010|work=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons Paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Kotchen |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Rapson |first3=David S. |last4=Wagner |first4=Gernot |title=Energy policy: The rebound effect is overplayed |journal=Nature |date=23 January 2013 |volume=493 |issue=7433 |pages=475–476 |doi=10.1038/493475a |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/493475a |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=En |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|last2=Campbell|first2=Nina|title=Spreading the net: the multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements|journal=IEA Energy Papers|doi=10.1787/20792581|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/spreading-the-net-the-multiple-benefits-of-energy-efficiency-improvements_5k9crzjbpkkc-en|accessdate=5 June 2015|series=IEA Energy Papers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that [[energy conservation]] efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of [[peak oil]]. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Potter | first=Andrew | title=Planet-friendly design? Bah, humbug | journal=[[Maclean's]] |volume=120 |issue=5 | page=14 | url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070202_154815_4816 |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214235056/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070202_154815_4816|archivedate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservation Wastes Energy "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassel |first=Kimberley A. |date=2001-05-17 |title=Conservation Wastes Energy |journal=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Wall St. Journal—Opinion|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/kstrassel/?id=95000484 |accessdate=2009-07-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113194327/http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/kstrassel/?id=95000484|archivedate=2005-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several points have been raised against this argument. First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant.&lt;ref name="Small"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = National Council for Science and the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|pages= 2–8.
|doi= 10.1002/aic.10747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a [[fuel tax]]) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt;

The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that [[sustainable energy]] policy must rely on other types of government interventions.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amado|first1=Nilton Bispo|last2=Sauer|first2=Ildo L.|title=An ecological economic interpretation of the Jevons effect|journal=Ecological Complexity|date=February 2012|volume=9|pages=2–9|doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2011.10.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X11000717|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt; To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. [[ecotax|green taxes]], [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]], or higher [[emissions standard]]s). The [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt; By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.&lt;ref name="Laitner DeCanio Peters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laitner |first=John A.|first2=Stephen J.|last2= De Canio |first3= Irene|last3= Peters |title=Incorporating Behavioural, Social, and Organizational Phenomena in the Assessment of Climate Change Mitigation Options  |journal=Society, Behaviour, and Climate Change Mitigation |year=2003|volume=8 |pages=1–64|doi=10.1007/0-306-48160-X_1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n107734r313hh4wp/ |accessdate=2010-08-08|series=Advances in Global Change Research|isbn=0-7923-6802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional institutions are the societies and associations, they help develop and promote a career and the people who practice in it. There are many chartered professional institutes in the UK, over 80, that cover many different areas of work. The different areas of work that are covered includes constructions, health, journalism, personnel, finance, engineering, law and of course, management. The professional institutes can help you both before and after you graduate.&lt;ref&gt;http://targetjobs.co.uk/professional-qualification-and-accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
There are institutes that have websites that you're able to sign up to, where they help you with your development and challenges within the professional institutes. One of the websites that provides this service is http://www.managers.org.uk/ the Chartered Management Institute. You are able to attend events and take courses based on many different types of institutes in management and learn about development, these would include: Leadership event, Building a business event, Visionary leaders event, Introduction to Management course and Essential management skills course. They say that they are the only Awarding Body that are able to award Chartered Manager status, which is the ultimate management accolade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managers.org.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}

Different institutes have different ways of helping you further in your career, such as learning styles. The institutes would assess you, and how they assess you would be individual to the institute; it would most likely be based on your education, knowledge, skills and experience. They might also have different ways of grading and awarding points, as well as different types of membership that you're able to have; some institutes have one day programs, monthly programs and even group programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ims-online.com/membership.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Management is a major factor in all careers, it consists of organising, controlling, planning and also, directing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management.html&lt;/ref&gt; Management is at the top of hierarchy as it is what controls everything else within a company/business. If there is no management, then there would be no order or organisation within a company, this would result in the company not being successful. This is why institutes for management would be important and very useful.

There are many different areas of work that go into management; it expands into many different sectors due to how broad management is. Some of the different types of management includes, '''Accounting''' management, '''Business''' management and '''Marketing''' management.

==Institutes==
An institute is an organisation that has a particular purpose, in this case, the purpose is for further and higher education;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=institute+definition&lt;/ref&gt; some higher education institutions hold university statues'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0729436052000318569 | volume=24 | title=Occupational stress in UK higher education institutions: a comparative study of all staff categories | journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development | pages=41–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher education institutions need to have a distinct image that they should maintain and also to develop, this would be so that they can create a competitive advantage as the market is increasingly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Paramewaran, R, and Glowacka, AE. (1995), “University image: an information processing perspective”, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, Vol. 6 No. 2, pp. 41‐56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tertiary education system that is undergoing fundamental metamorphosis, this is both in the UK and South Africa; they are both facing changes in government funding. There are at least 71 different institutes that are represented in the UK and at least 20 different institutions from South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Ivy, (2001) "Higher education institution image: acorrespondence analysis approach", International Journal of Educational Management, Vol. 15 Iss: 6, pp.276 - 282&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a company website called 'IMD World Competitiveness Centre', they have a partnership with institutes and have a worldwide network. They have partner institutes in 55 countries; the IMD World Competitiveness Centre helps with '''business''', academics highlight competitive advantage, governments and undercover opportunities by offering a range of products and services which includes workshops and economy assessments. They have partner institutes in Africa/Middle East and they include in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, South Africa and United Arab Emirates. Partner Institutes in America includes, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. In Asia/Pacific they include Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Lastly, in Europe they include, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcc-partner/#tab=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are institutes that are profitable, there are also institutes that are not profitable. In the UK, there is an institute called 'Project Management Institute' and it is the world's leading non profitable professional membership association. It was founded in 1969 and it delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals that work in nearly every country, they advance careers and improve organisational success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmi.org/About-Us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK==
The UK government policies dictate that education in higher education institutes look to profit-making organisations for models that would help with performance improvement (Galloway, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, L. (1998), “Quality perceptions of internal and external customers: a case study in education administration”, The TQM Magazine, Vol. 10 No 1, pp. 20‐6.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that there is a need for strengthening of the partnership between educational institutes and business.

The phenomenon of '''macromolecular crowding''' alters the properties of molecules in a [[solution]] when high concentrations of [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s are present.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem.

This crowding effect can make molecules in cells behave in radically different ways than in test-tube assays.&lt;ref name=Minton2/&gt; Consequently, measurements of the properties of [[enzyme]]s or processes in [[metabolism]] that are made in the laboratory (''[[in vitro]]'') in dilute solutions may be different by many orders of magnitude from the true values seen in living cells (''[[in vivo]]''). The study of biochemical processes under realistically crowded conditions is very important, since these conditions are a ubiquitous property of all cells and crowding may be essential for the efficient operation of metabolism. Indeed, ''[[in vitro]]'' studies showed that crowding greatly influences binding stability of proteins to DNA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cause and effects==
The interior of cells is a crowded environment. For example, an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell is only about 2&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre]]s (μm) long and 0.5&amp;nbsp;μm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7&amp;nbsp;μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kubitschek HE |title=Cell volume increase in Escherichia coli after shifts to richer media |journal=J.

Reducing the available volume increases the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentration]] of macromolecules.]]

These high concentrations of macromolecules occupy a large proportion of the volume of the cell, which reduces the volume of solvent that is available for other macromolecules. This [[excluded volume]] effect increases the effective concentration of macromolecules (increasing their [[Activity (chemistry)|chemical activity]]), which in turn alters the [[reaction rate|rates]] and [[equilibrium constant]]s of their reactions.&lt;ref name=Minton&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton AP |title=The influence of macromolecular crowding and macromolecular confinement on biochemical reactions in physiological media |journal=J.

The size of the crowding effect depends on both the [[molecular mass]] and shape of the molecule involved, although mass seems to be the major factor &amp;ndash; with the effect being stronger with larger molecules.&lt;ref name=Minton/&gt; Notably, the size of the effect is non-linear, so macromolecules are much more strongly affected than are small molecules such as [[amino acid]]s or [[monosaccharide|simple sugars]]. Macromolecular crowding is therefore an effect exerted by large molecules on the properties of other large molecules.

A particularly striking example of the importance of crowding effects involves the [[crystallin]]s that fill the interior of the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]].

==Study==
Due to macromolecular crowding, [[enzyme assay]]s and [[Biophysical techniques|biophysical measurements]] performed in dilute solution may fail to reflect the actual process and its kinetics taking place in the cytosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norris MG, Malys N |title=What is the true enzyme kinetics in the biological system?

However, such extracts contain many kinds of biologically active molecules, which can interfere with the phenomena being studied.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Consequently, crowding effects are mimicked ''in vitro'' by adding high concentrations of relatively inert molecules such as [[polyethylene glycol]], [[ficoll]], [[dextran]], or [[serum albumin]] to experimental media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tokuriki N, Kinjo M, Negi S, etal |title=Protein folding by the effects of macromolecular crowding |journal=Protein Sci. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=125–33 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14691228 |pmc=2286514 |url=http://www.proteinscience.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14691228 |doi=10.1110/ps.03288104 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, using such artificial crowding agents can be complicated, as these crowding molecules can sometimes interact in other ways with the process being examined, such as by binding weakly to one of the components.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

==Macromolecular crowding and protein folding==
A major importance of macromolecular crowding to biological systems stems from its effect on [[protein folding]]. The underlying physical mechanism by which macromolecular crowding helps to stabilize proteins in their folded state is often explained in terms of excluded volume - the volume inaccessible to the proteins due to their interaction with macromolecular crowders.&lt;ref name="Minton1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minton|first=A.|title=Excluded Volume as a Determinant of Macromolecular Structure and Reactivity|journal=Biopolymers|year=1981|volume=20|pages=2093–2120|doi=10.1002/bip.1981.360201006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsegian2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsegian |first=VA.|title=Protein-water interactions.|journal=Int.

== Macromolecular crowding in regenerative medicine ==
Satyam et al. from National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI Galway) proposed macromolecular crowding as means to create ECM-rich tissue equivalents. The principle of  macromolecular crowding is derived from the notion that ''in vivo'' cells reside in a highly crowded/dense extracellular space and therefore the conversion of the ''de novo'' synthesised procollagen to collagen I is rapid. However, in the even substantially more dilute than body fluids (e.g., urine: 36–50 g/L; blood: 80 g/L) culture conditions (e.g., HAM F10 nutrient medium: 16.55 g/L; DMEM/ F12 medium: 16.78 g/L; DMEM high glucose and L-glutamine medium: 17.22 g/L), the rate limiting conversion of procollagen to collagen I is very slow. It was confirmed that the addition of inert polydispersed macromolecules (presented as spherical objects of variable diameter in the culture media will facilitate amplified production of ECM-rich living substitutes. Macromolecular crowding, by imitating native tissue localised density, can be utilised to effectively modulate ''in vitro'' microenvironments and ultimately produce ECM-rich cell substitutes, within hours rather than days or months in culture, without compromising fundamental cellular functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satyam|first=Abhigyan|last2=Kumar|first2=Pramod|last3=Fan|first3=Xingliang|last4=Gorelov|first4=Alexander|last5=Rochev|first5=Yury|last6=Joshi|first6=Lokesh|last7=Peinado|first7=Héctor|last8=Lyden|first8=David|last9=Thomas|first9=Benjamin|date=2014-05-21|title=Macromolecular crowding meets tissue engineering by self-assembly: a paradigm shift in regenerative medicine|journal=Advanced Materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)|volume=26|issue=19|pages=3024–3034|doi=10.1002/adma.201304428|issn=1521-4095|pmid=24505025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Pramod|last2=Satyam|first2=Abhigyan|last3=Fan|first3=Xingliang|last4=Collin|first4=Estelle|last5=Rochev|first5=Yury|last6=Rodriguez|first6=Brian J.|last7=Gorelov|first7=Alexander|last8=Dillon|first8=Simon|last9=Joshi|first9=Lokesh|date=2015-03-04|title=Macromolecularly crowded in vitro microenvironments accelerate the production of extracellular matrix-rich supramolecular assemblies|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|pages=8729|doi=10.1038/srep08729|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4348624|pmid=25736020|bibcode=2015NatSR...5E8729K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satyam|first=Abhigyan|last2=Kumar|first2=Pramod|last3=Cigognini|first3=Daniela|last4=Pandit|first4=Abhay|last5=Zeugolis|first5=Dimitrios I.|date=2016-10-15|title=Low, but not too low, oxygen tension and macromolecular crowding accelerate extracellular matrix deposition in human dermal fibroblast culture|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=44|pages=221–231|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.008|issn=1878-7568|pmid=27506127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Engineered living tissue substitute|date=Dec 12, 2012|url=http://www.google.com/patents/EP2532736A1|inventor-last=Zeugolis|inventor2-last=Satyam|inventor-first=Dimitrios|inventor2-first=Abhigyan|issue=EP2532736 A1|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mexican Health and Aging Study''' (MHAS), also known by its Spanish name, ''Estudio Nacional de Salud y Envejecimiento en México, ENASEM,'' is the first [[panel study]] of [[health]] and [[aging]] in [[Mexico]]. The first phase of MHAS (waves 1 and 2) was supported by a grant from the MHAS was supported by a grant from the [[National Institutes of Health]]/[[National Institute on Aging]] (AG 18016, BJ Soldo, PI). The study was a collaborative effort among researchers from the Universities of [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[University of Maryland|Maryland]], and [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] in the U.S., and the ''[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e Informática]]'' (INEGI, Mexico).

The second phase of MHAS (waves 3 and 4) is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (R01AG018016, R Wong, PI) and by the INEGI in Mexico. The new study is a collaborative effort from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] (UTMB), ''[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e Informática]]'' (INEGI, Mexico), the [[University of Wisconsin]], the Instituto Nacional de Geriatría (INGER, Mexico) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP, Mexico).

==Study goals==
The overall goal of the study is to examine the aging process and its disease and disability burden in a large representative panel of older Mexicans from a wide socioeconomic spectrum. The MHAS design was motivated by several research questions related to the dynamics of health and aging in Mexico; the effect on the multiple domains of health of early- and mid-life health behaviors, migration, transfers, and socioeconomic status; and health selectivity among migrants to the U.S. and among those returning to Mexico.

==Study description==
The MHAS includes a nationally representative sample of Mexicans 50 years and older and their spouses of partners regardless of age, and used protocols and survey instruments that are highly comparable to the U.S. [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS). The baseline survey is a national representative survey of individuals born prior to 1951. The baseline survey was conducted in 2001, and a follow-up visit to the same individuals was conducted in 2003. The sample for the MHAS baseline was selected from residents of both rural and urban areas, from the National Employment survey (Encuesta Nacional de Empleo, ENE), carried out by the INEGI (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia) in Mexico; 11,000 households with at least one resident of age 50 or older were eligible to be part of the MHAS baseline sample. The baseline survey was conducted in the summer of 2001 with a sample size of 15,186 respondents. A direct interview was sought with each individual, and proxy interviews obtained when poor health or temporary absence precluded a direct interview. A follow-up survey was carried out in the summer of 2003; all age-eligible subjects from the 2001 wave were targeted even if they had moved. If the subject had died, an interview was conducted with an informed respondent. New spouses of respondents from 2001 were interviewed and included in the 2003 follow-up study, for a total of 14,250 interviews including 546 next-of-kin interviews.

A follow-up visit was completed in 2012. In addition to a follow-up of the 2001 and 2003 respondents, the sample was refreshed by adding a representative sample of the population from the 1952-1962 birth cohorts, as well as their spouses/partners regardless of age. Similar to the baseline interview, the sampling frame for the new cohort sample was the Mexican National Employment and Occupation Survey (ENOE, previously named National Employment Survey, ENE) 2012. During the 2012 survey, 18,465 interviews were completed, including 2,742 next-of-kin interviews. The survey was conducted using a new CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview) system. Also new to the third wave of the study was the collection of a blood sample for biomarkers from a sub-sample (n=2,089) and questions on the occurrence of major life events of the respondents.

The MHAS is a high quality study, with excellent response and follow-up rates. Response rates for waves in 2001, 2003 and 2012 were 91.8%, 93.3% and 88.1%, respectively. The next wave of the study is planned to be fielded in 2015.

==Study website==
The [http://www.mhasweb.org study website] has a user-friendly environment that was designed to enhance the usability of and access to MHAS survey data and documentation. The platform is in both English ([http://www.MHASweb.org www.MHASweb.org] and Spanish ([http://www.ENASEM.org www.ENASEM.org]). Databases and study documents can be accessed from the website and include:

•	Questionnaires
•	Interviewer and Coder Manuals
•	Codebooks with variable codes and frequencies
•	Follow-up master file to link study subjects through the three waves
•	Fieldwork reports: duration of interviews, response rates

The website also features a searchable database of publications using MHAS data and a discussion forum available to all users. The discussion forum can be used to facilitate research collaborations and share knowledge among users, including codes for constructing common variables. The database of publications is a non-exhaustive compilation of peer-reviewed publications, working papers, and other research documents using MHAS data.

==Survey contents==
'''Health Measures:''' Self-reports of conditions, symptoms, functional status, lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking and drinking history), use/source/costs of health care services, depression, pain, reading and cognitive performance tests;

'''Background:''' Childhood health and living conditions, education, ability to read/write and count, migration history, marital history;

'''Family:''' Rosters of all children (including deceased children); for each, demographic attributes, summary indicators of childhood and current health, education, current work status, migration. Parent and sibling migration experiences;

'''Transfers:''' Financial and time help given to and received by respondent from children, indexed to specific child; time and financial help to parent;

'''Economic:''' Sources and amounts of income, including wages, pensions, and government subsidies; type and value of assets. All non-response in amount questions were followed by bracketed amounts to reduce non-response;

'''Housing Environment:''' Type, location, building materials, other indicators of quality, and ownership of consumer durables;

'''Anthropometric:''' Interviewers measured weight, height; waist, hip, and calf circumference, knee length, and timed one-leg stands for a random subsample (20%) of respondents.

'''Biomarkers (included in 2012):''' C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin D, hemoglobin, HbAlc (using Ac1 Now);

'''Performance Measures (included in 2012):''' Walking speed, grip strength, and balance.

==Publications==
Publications using the MHAS data cover a broad range of disciplines, including demography, microeconomics, labor economics, public health, epidemiology and health care policy. Published papers have appeared in diverse peer reviewed journals of multiple disciplines related to aging and health, both in the U.S. and abroad.

==History==
An early reference to the concept is found in the betting book for [[Brooks's]], a London [[gentlemen's club]]. The 1785 entry (only two years after the first successful balloon ascent by [[Montgolfier brothers|Étienne Montgolfier]]) reads:  "[[George James Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|Ld. Cholmondeley]] has given two guineas to [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|Ld. Derby]], to receive 500 Gs whenever his lordship has sex with a woman in a balloon one thousand yards from the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Mitchell's biography of Charles James Fox. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uariyzldrJwC&amp;pg=PA98  Quoted in Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; (However, there is no further indication that the bet was paid, or even how they would check it if it was claimed.){{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During the First World War, German Ace Oswald Boelcke was disciplined by superiors for taking a nurse up in the cockpit of his fighter, allegedly becoming the first person to qualify as a member of the club.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John F., Enduring Courage: Ace Pilot Eddie Rickenbacker and The Dawn of the Era of Speed.

==Legality==
{{globalize|date=September 2011}}

The [[BBC]] ran an article investigating whether sex on a plane was legal. Their conclusion was that it would depend on many factors, such as whether or not the act occurred in sight of others. If British law applied, for example, it may constitute sex in lavatory to which the public has access, contrary to [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] s.71, with a maximum 6-month term.

Also, for international flights, the law could vary depending on departure and destination cities and the nation of the carrier airline,&lt;ref name="bbcsexlegal"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6360869.stm | title=Is sex on a plane legal? | date=14 February 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the country of registration of the aircraft, and possibly the citizenship of the people involved.

In January 2011, the United Kingdom's aviation regulator body, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), refused to recertify Mile-High Flights, an air charter company located in [[Gloucestershire]] for allowing its passengers to have sex while in-flight.&lt;ref name="sexflightgrounded"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=AvStop.com | url=http://avstop.com/news_january_2011/sex_flights_gets_grounded_by_the_civil_aviation_authority.htm | title=Sex Flights Gets Grounded By The Civil Aviation Authority | accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moss''' is a [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]] that [[Meteorite fall|fell]] over the communities of [[Rygge]] and [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] in [[Østfold]] county, southeast southern Norway in the morning of midsummer day, July 14, 2006.

The last time a type CO3 meteorite fell from the sky was in 1937 with [[Kainsaz meteorite|Kainsaz]], Russia. There are 6 known falls of a CO3 meteorite. Being of the rare [[Carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous]] subtype, 'meteorite man' [[Robert A. Haag|Robert Haag]] stated to the media that this was the most important meteorite fall since the Canadian [[Tagish Lake meteorite|Tagish Lake]] fall in January 2000.

==History==

===Prelude===
The summer of 2006 was the meteorite summer in Norway. The summer was very warm and dry. It was perfect weather to protect the valuable droppings that the skies let fall over Norway.
It started in the beginning of June when on the 7th a very large meteor explosion was seen and heard over large areas in northernmost Norway. Although no meteorites was found from that event, its size stirred a whole world of meteorite aficionados and a stunned scientific community in Norway and abroad.

Then on the 10th of July it was announced on [[NRK]]1, Norway's number one TV channel, that a meteorite had been found in a man's driveway south of [[Stavanger]]. The story was soon denounced by the experts as being a [[plutonic]] rock from a nearby source.

But then, incredible as it was, just four days later the skies opened for a true meteorite fall event. This turned out to be the 13th find of a meteorite in Norway. At the same time its 9th fall.

As if this was not enough, at the end of August a very large fireball was seen north from [[Troms]] county to south of [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], almost along the whole coast of the country, but no meteorites were found.

===Fall===
At about 10:20 a.m. on the 14th of July a large meteor was seen in broad daylight by a large number of people heading north-northwest over [[Østfold]] county, Norway. It split into 4 or 5 smaller objects. It was seen from a large area extending outwards in all directions from the [[Oslofjord]] area, in north limited to roughly [[Lake Mjøsa]], in east from [[Årjäng]], Sweden, and in the southwest to the coast area of [[Sørlandet]]. Over Rygge and Moss a loud explosion and a rumbling sound was heard.
A man near his summer cabin in Rygge saw and heard a small piece of stone hit an aluminium sheet about 2 meter away. This was the only directly observed impacting stone from the fall.

===Finds===
In all there were five separate finds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/det-regner-steiner-1.4268853 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About first stone, 36.7g]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/himmel-for-et-funn-1.4291642 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About second stone, 752g]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/meteoritt-gjennom-tak-1.4269829 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About fifth stone, 676g]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Moss CO3.6 meteorite. They distributed over a [[Strewn field|strewnfield]] about {{convert|6|km}} long from southeast in [[Rygge]] to northwest in parts of north [[Moss, Norway|Moss]].

The largest find, the [[main mass]], was in several tens of pieces, part of it being smashed while hitting a fence. It was almost {{convert|2|kg}} in weight.
The total weight of all the finds was over {{convert|4|kg}}.&lt;ref name=metbull /&gt;

==Classification and scientific studies==
[[File:Moss meteorite, slice2.jpg|thumb|Moss slice]]
Several scientific papers have come out on the closer study of the meteorite.
The first preliminary study of August 2006 showed that it contains numerous small [[chondrules]], most &lt;0.2mm and small &lt;1mm amoeboid [[olivine]] aggregates (AOAs) and small [[Ca-Al-rich inclusion|CAIs]] (calcium aluminium inclusions). It also contains isolated grains of [[olivine]], [[troilite]] and [[kamacite]] in a gray [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].

It has been classified as [[carbonaceous chondrite]] of type CO3 - [[Ornans meteorite|Ornans]] type. Its accepted designation is CO3.6. Its petrologic type 3.6 means that it is only slightly [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] by heating from its original state, but more so than most of the 5 other CO3 falls. Its closest kin of these falls is Ornans, the group type specimen. It contains only about 0.25 percent [[carbon]], some present as [[organic compound]]s. Typically [[benzene]], [[toluene]], C2-alkyl benzene and traces of biphenyl, benzonitrile and aliphatic hydrocarbones.

The [[shock stage]] is S2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Museum Planning''' is the creation of documents to describe a new [[museum]]’s vision, the visitor experience and an organizational plan for a new institution, or one undergoing a major expansion or change in focus.

[[Museum]] plans may include some or all of the following:
* A review of institutional resources, assets and [[Collection (museum)|collections]]
* A review of local attractions and museums
* A new or updated mission and vision
* [[Collection (museum)|Collections]] objectives of the new institution
* Educational objectives of the new institution
* Experience objectives of the new institution
* Potential visitor and other audience and user groups
* [[Interpretive planning|Interpretive Plan]]
* [[Exhibition]] storylines
* Visitor flow diagrams
* Thematic treatments
* Preliminary [[exhibition]] layout
* Style Boards
* Exhibition Renderings
* Space Needs Analysis
* [[Site selection]]
* Architectural Concepts
* Preliminary staffing plan
* Preliminary project schedule
* Preliminary project budget

Plans are created by a [[museum]] planning team, that includes; [[museum]] staff and volunteers, members of the [[board of directors]], community members, and representatives of city and state planning agencies working together with a museum planner, architects, exhibit designers, economists, and other specialist consultants. The objective of a [[Museum]] Plan is to create a clear and concise “road map” for the creation of new institution and a sustainable long term museum vision.

Museum planning may also refer to the designing of [[museum]] galleries, spaces, or new wings and buildings. The goal of a well-designed museum space is that it accents the collection, and puts the patron at ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many features of galleries that must be considered when organizing and planning a new space. Some of those aspects are '''circulation, density, lighting, backgrounds, arrangement, and labels.'''

The '''circulation''' of the space indicates the layout and direction of flow for visitors. This can be done by numbering objects, or the layout of displays. Poor circulation can result in the patron missing some galleries or displays or viewing objects in an order other than what the curator intended. Circulation should feel natural and logical; the patron may feel herded and become resentful.

'''Density, clarity, and emphasis''' are other aspects to consider when planning a new space. Galleries and individual objects should be placed so that everything appears to have equal value and importance. Then within displays, objects should not be overcrowded or cluttered. '''Lighting''' is extremely important and cannot be overlooked when planning new galleries. Natural light is ideal, but it must be filtered, and not too intense. It also should be consistent throughout the day – northern and southern exposure is ideal. 

'''Backgrounds''' can refer to a number of things: props, panels, or a simple painted wall can serve as a background to an object or display.  These must be subdued enough that they do not detract from the object on display, but they should be complimentary. The specific '''position, arrangement, and display''' of an object is important to consider. Height of the display case, order in which objects are placed or hung, and the grouping of certain objects are all major factors in how patrons interpret objects. 

'''[[Museum label]] and explanatory accessories''' are essential to a patron’s experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron feels as if they understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels at the start of each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object’s use, medium, creator, and dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NASA Deep Space Network''' ('''DSN''') is a worldwide network of U.S. [[spacecraft communication]] facilities, located in the United States (California), Spain (Madrid), and Australia (Canberra), that supports [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA's]] [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[spacecraft]] missions. It also performs [[radio astronomy|radio]] and [[radar astronomy]] observations for the exploration of the [[solar system]] and the [[universe]], and supports selected [[Earth]]-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL). Similar networks are run by [[Soviet Deep Space Network|Russia]], [[Chinese Deep Space Network|China]], [[Indian Deep Space Network|India]], [[Japanese Deep Space Network|Japan]] and the [[ESTRACK|European Space Agency]].

Each facility is situated in semi-mountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to help shield against radio frequency interference.&lt;ref name="antennas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/antennas/index.html |title=DSN:antennas |publisher=JPL, NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411022826/http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/antennas/index.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic placement with nearly 120-degree separation permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates, which helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast06jun_1|title=Bracing for an Interplanetary Traffic Jam {{!}} Science Mission Directorate|website=science.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSN supports [[NASA|NASA's]] contribution to the [[Discovery and exploration of the Solar System|scientific investigation of the Solar System]]: It provides a two-way communications link that guides and controls various NASA [[unmanned spacecraft|unmanned]] interplanetary [[space probe]]s, and brings back the images and new scientific information these probes collect. All DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, [[parabolic reflector]] antennas.&lt;ref name="antennas"/&gt;
The antennas and data delivery systems make it possible to:&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

* acquire [[telemetry]] data from spacecraft.
* transmit commands to spacecraft.
* upload software modifications to spacecraft.
* track spacecraft position and velocity.
* perform [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] observations.
* measure variations in radio waves for radio science experiments.
* gather science data.
* monitor and control the performance of the network.

===Operations control center===
{{Main article|Space Flight Operations Facility}}

The antennas at all three DSN Complexes communicate directly with the Deep Space Operations Center (also known as Deep Space Network operations control center) located at the JPL facilities in [[Pasadena, California]].

In the early years, the operations control center did not have a permanent facility. It was a provisional setup with numerous desks and phones installed in a large room near the computers used to calculate orbits. In July 1961, NASA started the construction of the permanent facility, Space Flight Operations Facility (SFOF). The facility was completed in October 1963 and dedicated on May 14, 1964. In the initial setup of the SFOF, there were 31 consoles, 100 closed-circuit television cameras, and more than 200 television displays to support [[Ranger 6]] to [[Ranger 9]] and [[Mariner 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deep Space Network Operations Control Center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California|url=http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/history/dsn43.html|work=Picture Album of the DEEP SPACE NETWORK|publisher=NASA/JPL|accessdate=26 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115700/http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/history/dsn43.html|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the operations center personnel at SFOF monitor and direct operations, and oversee the quality of spacecraft telemetry and navigation data delivered to network users. In addition to the DSN complexes and the operations center, a ground communications facility provides communications that link the three complexes to the operations center at JPL, to space flight control centers in the United States and overseas, and to scientists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Facts: Deep Space Network |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/DSN-0203.pdf |publisher=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DSNantenna.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|left|View from the Earth's north pole, showing the field of view of the main DSN antenna locations. Once a mission gets more than 30,000 km from earth, it is al&amp;shy;ways in view of at least one of the stations.]]

Tracking vehicles in deep space is quite different from tracking missions in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO). Deep space missions are visible for long periods of time from a large portion of the Earth's surface, and so require few stations (the DSN has only three main sites).  These few stations, however, require huge antennas, ultra-sensitive receivers, and powerful transmitters in order to transmit and receive over the vast distances involved.

Deep space is defined in several different ways. According to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was designed to communicate with "spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000&amp;nbsp;km (10,000 miles) from Earth to the farthest planets of the solar system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report2/42-28/28A.PDF |title= DSN Functions and Facilities |author=N. Renzetti |date= May 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; JPL diagrams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/42668/1/12-1936_A1b.pdf= |title=NASA’s Deep Space Network: Big Antennas with a Big Job |author=Dr. Les Deutsch }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; state that at an altitude of 30,000&amp;nbsp;km, a spacecraft is always in the field of view of one of the tracking stations.

The [[International Telecommunications Union]], which sets aside various frequency bands for deep space and near Earth use, defines "deep space" to start at a distance of 2 million km from the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsndocs/810-005/201/201B.pdf |title=201, Rev. B:  Frequency and Channel Assignments |date=December 15, 2009 |access-date=July 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611094446/http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsndocs/810-005/201/201B.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition means that missions to the Moon, and the Earth–Sun [[Lagrangian point]]s L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are considered near space and cannot use the ITU's [[deep space bands]]. Other Lagrangian points may or may not be subject to this rule due to distance.

== History ==
{{further information|History of the Deep Space Network}}

The forerunner of the DSN was established in January 1958, when [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], then under contract to the [[U.S. Army]], deployed portable radio tracking stations in Nigeria, Singapore, and California to receive [[telemetry]] and plot the orbit of the Army-launched [[Explorer 1]], the first successful U.S. [[satellite]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4227/Uplink-Downlink.pdf ''Uplink-Downlink: A History of the Deep Space Network, 1957–1997'' (NASA SP-2001-4227)], page 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] was officially established on October 1, 1958, to consolidate the separately developing space-exploration programs of the US Army, [[US Navy]], and [[US Air Force]] into one civilian organization.&lt;ref name="act1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/about/space_act1.html|title=The National Aeronautics and Space Act|accessdate=November 9, 2007|publisher=NASA|date=2005|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 1958, JPL was transferred from the US Army to NASA and given responsibility for the design and execution of lunar and planetary exploration programs using remotely controlled spacecraft. Shortly after the transfer, NASA established the concept of the Deep Space Network as a separately managed and operated communications system that would accommodate all [[Deep space exploration|deep space]] missions, thereby avoiding the need for each flight project to acquire and operate its own specialized space communications network. The DSN was given responsibility for its own research, development, and operation in support of all of its users. Under this concept, it has become a world leader in the development of low-noise receivers; large parabolic-dish antennas; tracking, telemetry, and command systems; digital signal processing; and deep space navigation. The Deep Space Network formally announced its intention to send missions into deep space on Christmas Eve 1963; it has remained in continuous operation in one capacity or another ever since.&lt;ref name="Christmas Eve 1963 Genesis"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://longreads.com/2018/03/15/welcome-to-the-center-of-the-universe/amp/?__twitter_impression=true |title=Welcome to the Center of the Universe |last=Stirone |first=Shannon |date=March 2018 |website=LongReads |access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest antennas of the DSN are often called on during spacecraft emergencies. Almost all spacecraft are designed so normal operation can be conducted on the smaller (and more economical) antennas of the DSN, but during an emergency the use of the largest antennas is crucial. This is because a troubled spacecraft may be forced to use less than its normal transmitter power, [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] problems may preclude the use of [[high-gain antenna]]s, and recovering every bit of telemetry is critical to assessing the health of the spacecraft and planning the recovery. The most famous example is the [[Apollo 13]] mission, where limited battery power and inability to use the spacecraft's high-gain antennas reduced signal levels below the capability of the [[Manned Space Flight Network]], and the use of the biggest DSN antennas (and the Australian [[Parkes Observatory]] radio telescope) was critical to saving the lives of the astronauts. While Apollo was also a US mission, DSN provides this emergency service to other space agencies as well, in a spirit of inter-agency and international cooperation. For example, the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory#Near loss of SOHO|recovery]] of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) mission of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) would not have been possible without the use of the largest DSN facilities.

=== DSN and the Apollo program ===
Although normally tasked with tracking unmanned spacecraft, the Deep Space Network (DSN) also contributed to the communication and tracking of [[Apollo program|Apollo mission]]s to the [[Moon]], although primary responsibility was held by the [[Manned Space Flight Network]]. The DSN designed the MSFN stations for lunar communication and provided a second antenna at each MSFN site (the MSFN sites were near the DSN sites for just this reason). Two antennas at each site were needed both for redundancy and because the beam widths of the large antennas needed were too small to encompass both the lunar orbiter and the lander at the same time. DSN also supplied some larger antennas as needed, in particular for television broadcasts from the Moon, and emergency communications such as Apollo 13.&lt;ref name="Mandal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shunpike.mit.edu/writings/16.895J_Interview_Report_Soumyajit.pdf|format=PDF|title=Engineering Apollo, Interview Report: Deep Space Network Support for the Apollo Missions|author=Soumyajit Mandal|accessdate=July 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001947/http://shunpike.mit.edu/writings/16.895J_Interview_Report_Soumyajit.pdf|archivedate=July 20, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpt from a NASA report describing how the DSN and MSFN cooperated for Apollo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=NASA Technical report CR 140390, Histories of the Space Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN), the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN), and the NASA Communications Network ([[NASCOM]])|hdl=2060/19750002909|author=William R. Corliss|publisher=NASA|date=1974 }} 100MB PDF file. Explicitly non-copyrighted.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Another critical step in the evolution of the Apollo Network came in 1965 with the advent of the DSN Wing concept. Originally, the participation of DSN 26-m antennas during an Apollo Mission was to be limited to a backup role. This was one reason why the MSFN 26-m sites were collocated with the DSN sites at Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra. However, the presence of two, well-separated spacecraft during lunar operations stimulated the rethinking of the tracking and communication problem. One thought was to add a dual S-band RF system to each of the three 26-m MSFN antennas, leaving the nearby DSN 26-m antennas still in a backup role. Calculations showed, though, that a 26-m antenna pattern centered on the landed Lunar Module would suffer a 9-to-12 db loss at the lunar horizon, making tracking and data acquisition of the orbiting Command Service Module difficult, perhaps impossible. It made sense to use both the MSFN and DSN antennas simultaneously during the all-important lunar operations. JPL was naturally reluctant to compromise the objectives of its many unmanned spacecraft by turning three of its DSN stations over to the MSFN for long periods. How could the goals of both Apollo and deep space exploration be achieved without building a third 26-m antenna at each of the three sites or undercutting planetary science missions?
}}
{{quote|The solution came in early 1965 at a meeting at NASA Headquarters, when Eberhardt Rechtin suggested what is now known as the "wing concept". The wing approach involves constructing a new section or "wing" to the main building at each of the three involved DSN sites. The wing would include a MSFN control room and the necessary interface equipment to accomplish the following:

# Permit tracking and two-way data transfer with either spacecraft during lunar operations.
# Permit tracking and two-way data transfer with the combined spacecraft during the flight to the Moon.
# Provide backup for the collocated MSFN site passive track (spacecraft to ground RF links) of the Apollo spacecraft during trans-lunar and trans-earth phases.

With this arrangement, the DSN station could be quickly switched from a deep-space mission to Apollo and back again. GSFC personnel would operate the MSFN equipment completely independently of DSN personnel. Deep space missions would not be compromised nearly as much as if the entire station's equipment and personnel were turned over to Apollo for several weeks.
}}

== Management ==
The network is a NASA facility and is managed and operated for NASA by JPL, which is part of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). The Interplanetary Network Directorate (IND) manages the program within JPL and is charged with the development and operation of it. The IND is considered to be JPL's focal point for all matters relating to telecommunications, interplanetary navigation, information systems, information technology, computing, software engineering, and other relevant technologies. While the IND is best known for its duties relating to the Deep Space Network, the organization also maintains the JPL [[Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System]] (AMMOS) and JPL's [[Institutional Computing and Information Services]] (ICIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmot.jpl.nasa.gov/Program_Overview_Information/program_overview_information.html |title=IND Technology Program Overview |publisher=JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411171552/http://tmot.jpl.nasa.gov/Program_Overview_Information/program_overview_information.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|hdl=2014/40704|title=Interplanetary Network Directorate |author=Weber, William J.|date=May 27, 2004|publisher=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antennas ==
[[Image:Goldstone DSN antenna.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|70&amp;nbsp;m antenna at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]], [[California]].]]
Each complex consists of at least four deep space terminals equipped with ultra-sensitive receiving systems and large parabolic-dish antennas. There are:

* One {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter High Efficiency antenna (HEF).
* Two or more {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Beam waveguide antenna]]s (BWG) (three operational at the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone Complex]], two at the ''Robledo de Chavela complex'' (near [[Madrid]]), and two at the Canberra Complex).
* One {{convert|26|m|adj=on|sp=us}} antenna.
* One {{convert|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} antenna.

Five of the {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} beam waveguide antennas were added to the system in the late 1990s. Three were located at Goldstone, and one each at Canberra and Madrid. A second {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} beam waveguide antenna (the network's sixth) was completed at the Madrid complex in 2004.

In order to meet the current and future needs of deep space communication services, a number of new Deep Space Station antennas need to be built at the existing Deep Space Network sites. At the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex the first of these was completed October 2014 (DSS35), with a second becoming operational in October 2016 (DSS36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antennas|url=http://www.cdscc.nasa.gov/Pages/antennas.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction has also begun on an additional antenna at the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex. By 2025, the 70 meter antennas at all three locations will be decommissioned and replaced with 34 meter BWG antennas that will be arrayed. All systems will be upgraded to have X-band uplink capabilities and both X and Ka-band downlink capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/services/networks/txt_daep_transition.html|title=Proposed DSN Aperture Enhancement Project Transition|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2018|website=nasa.gov|access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current signal processing capabilities ==
[[File:Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex - general view (2174403243).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]] in 2008]]
The general capabilities of the DSN have not substantially changed since the beginning of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] Interstellar Mission in the early 1990s. However, many advancements in digital signal processing, arraying and error correction have been adopted by the DSN.

The ability to array several antennas was incorporated to improve the data returned from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' [[Neptune]] encounter, and extensively used for the [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]], when the high-gain antenna did not deploy correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Uplink-Downlink, Chapter 5, ''The Galileo Era – 1986–1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSN array currently available since the ''Galileo'' mission can link the {{convert|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} dish antenna at the Deep Space Network complex in Goldstone, California, with an identical antenna located in Australia, in addition to two {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} antennas at the Canberra complex. The California and Australia sites were used concurrently to pick up communications with ''Galileo''.

Arraying of antennas within the three DSN locations is also used. For example, a {{convert|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} dish antenna can be arrayed with a 34-meter dish. For especially vital missions, like ''Voyager 2'', the Canberra {{convert|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} dish can be arrayed with the [[Parkes Radio Telescope]] in Australia; and the Goldstone 70-meter dish can be arrayed with the [[Very Large Array]] of antennas in New Mexico. Also, two or more {{convert|34|m|adj=on|sp=us}} dishes at one DSN location are commonly arrayed together.

All the stations are remotely operated from a centralized Signal Processing Center at each complex. These Centers house the electronic subsystems that point and control the antennas, receive and process the telemetry data, transmit commands, and generate the spacecraft navigation data. Once the data is processed at the complexes, it is transmitted to JPL for further processing and for distribution to science teams over a modern communications network.

Especially at Mars, there are often many spacecraft within the beam width of an antenna.  For operational efficiency, a single antenna can receive signals from multiple spacecraft at the same time.  This capability is called '''Multiple Spacecraft Per Aperture''', or '''MSPA'''.  Currently the DSN can receive up to 4 spacecraft signals at the same time, or MSPA-4.  However, apertures cannot currently be shared for uplink.  When two or more high power carriers are used simultaneously, very high order intermodulation products fall in the receiver bands, causing interference to the much (25 orders of magnitude) weaker received signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |number=TDA Progress Report 42-127 |date=15 Nov 1996 |title=Noise Bursts and Intermodulation Products Caused by Multiple Carriers at X-Band |author=B. L. Conroy and D. J. Hoppe |institution=JPL |url=https://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-127/127E.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore only one spacecraft at a time can get an uplink, though up to 4 can be received.

== Network limitations and challenges ==
[[Image:Madrid Deep Space Network Complex.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|70m antenna in [[Robledo de Chavela]], [[Community of Madrid]], Spain]]
There are a number of limitations to the current DSN, and a number of challenges going forward.
* The Deep Space Network is something of a misnomer, as there are no current plans, nor future plans, for exclusive communication satellites anywhere in space to handle multiparty, multi-mission use. All the transmitting and receiving equipment are Earth-based. Therefore, data transmission rates from/to any and all spacecrafts and space probes are severely constrained due to the distances from Earth. 
* The need to support "legacy" missions that have remained operational beyond their original lifetimes but are still returning scientific data. Programs such as [[Voyager program|Voyager]] have been operating long past their original mission termination date. They also need some of the largest antennas.
* Replacing major components can cause problems as it can leave an antenna out of service for months at a time.
* The older 70M &amp; HEF antennas are reaching the end of their lives. At some point these will need to be replaced. The leading candidate for 70M replacement had been an array of smaller dishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dsnarray.jpl.nasa.gov/|title=The Future Deep Space Network: An Array of Many Small Antennas|publisher=JPL|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714022934/http://dsnarray.jpl.nasa.gov/|archivedate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5/4384367/04374100.pdf?isnumber=4384367&amp;arnumber=4374100|title=Proposed Array-Based Deep Space Network for NASA|publisher=IEEE|author=Durgadas S. Bagri |author2=Joseph I. Statman |author3=Mark S. Gatti |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recently the decision was taken to expand the provision of 34-meter (112&amp;nbsp;ft) BWG antennas at each complex to a total of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/deep-space-network-aperture-enhancement-project/|title=DSN Aperature Enhancement Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New spacecraft intended for missions beyond [[geocentric orbit]]s are being equipped to use the [[beacon mode service]], which allows such missions to operate without the DSN most of the time.

==DSN and radio science==
[[File:Illustration of Juno spacecraft at Jupiter (PIA19639).jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of ''Juno'' and Jupiter. ''Juno'' is in a polar orbit that takes it close to Jupiter as it passes from north to south, getting a view of both poles. During the GS experiment it must point its antenna at the Deep Space Network on Earth to pick up a special signal sent from DSN.]]
The DSN forms one portion of the radio sciences experiment included on most deep space missions, where radio links between spacecraft and Earth are used to investigate planetary science, space physics and fundamental physics.  The experiments include radio occultations, gravity field determination and celestial mechanics, bistatic scattering, doppler wind experiments, solar corona characterization, and tests of fundamental physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio Science|url=https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/research/research-topics-list/planetary-sciences/radio-science |publisher=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Deep Space Network forms one component of the [[Gravity Science (Juno)|gravity science experiment on ''Juno'']].  This includes special communication hardware on Juno and uses its communication system.&lt;ref name="europlanet-eu.org"&gt;[http://www.europlanet-eu.org/juno-europe/]&lt;/ref&gt; The DSN radiates a Ka-band uplink, which is picked up by ''Juno''{{'}}s Ka-Band communication system and then processed by a special communication box called KaTS, and then this new signal is sent back the DSN.&lt;ref name="europlanet-eu.org"/&gt; This allows the velocity of the spacecraft over time to be determined with a level of precision that allows a more accurate determination of the gravity field at planet Jupiter.&lt;ref name="europlanet-eu.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/space/what-will-we-learn-juno-mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another radio science experiment is [[REX (New Horizons)]], on New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto-Charon. REX received a signal from Earth as it was occulted by Pluto to take various measurements of that systems of bodies.

In [[semiotics]] the '''neutral level''' of a sign is the "trace" left behind; the physical or material creation or remains of [[esthesic and poietic]] processes, levels, and analyses of symbolic forms. A part of all [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] according to a tri-partitional definition, it corresponds to Saussure's "sound-image" (or "signified", thus Pierce's "representamen").

Thus, "a symbolic form...is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the [[poetic]] process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.')"

An '''immanent description''' is an analysis of the neutral level (Nattiez 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;75).

== Applied Semiotics ==

In an applied [[semiology]] the neutral level of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] is the "[[trace (semiology)|trace]]" left behind by a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[perfect|ideal]] creation (i.e. [[art]], [[masterpiece]] etc.); or fruits of creative processes and multi-staged levels of realisations, including analysis of the qualities of the [[ashtamangala|symbol]]ic forms as a consequence of an [[arousement]] of the analyst's or [[artist]]'s mindfullness as one of several factors for reaching an understandment of the neutral level of applied semiology depending on the frames of reference (i.e. [[Human body|corporeal]]/physical, [[emotional]]/[[Resource distribution|distribution]] of resources - [[economy]], [[intellectual]]/[[mind|cerebral]], [[artistic]]/[[Spirituality|spiritual]]."

== The Neutral level of the Neutral level ==

"Neutral" comes from the English word&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neuter neuter - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to a mutually understood non-dual background. "Neuter" has been used since the 14th century and is composed of ''ne'' meaning "not" + ''uter'' meaning ''which of two'', thus synonymous with either [1] The Neutral state is often misinterpreted as a passive state, but it should be understood as much not-passive as not-active or equal. It literally refers to the [[non-dual]] state of [[body and mind]], you and me or of any [[wikt:conflict|conflict]].

The '''Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences''' (PIMS) is a mathematical [[institute]] created in 1996 by universities in [[Western Canada]] and the [[Northwestern United States]] to promote research and excellence in all areas of the [[mathematical sciences]]. It provides training and support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers hosted at member institutions. It also supports visiting researchers and hosts events ranging from individual lectures to multi-year "collaborative research groups (CRGs)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/focus-periods PIMS focus periods] pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mathematical sciences. Additionally, PIMS has a large educational outreach program aimed at promoting mathematics at all levels but with particular focus on primary and secondary levels ([[K–12 (education)|K–12]]).

== Structure ==
PIMS has a distributed structure. Its central offices are located on the campus of the [[University of British Columbia]]. The members of the institute are:
* 9 full members: [[University of British Columbia]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Regina]], [[University of Victoria]], [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[Simon Fraser University]], [[University of Washington]], [[University of Lethbridge]], and [[University of Manitoba]].
* 2 affiliate members: [[University of Portland]] and [[University of Northern British Columbia]].
PIMS receives funding from [[NSERC]] and provincial governments. In 2007, the institute became a ''Unité Mixte Internationale'' of the French [[CNRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/insmi/spip.php?article23|title=L’Unité Mixte Internationale 3069 au Canada : PIMS|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cnrs.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pims.math.ca/pims-glance/collaborations-partnerships|title=Collaborations - Partnerships {{!}} Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences - PIMS|website=www.pims.math.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Research program ==
Research at PIMS includes both hosting of events and support for personnel. Post-doctoral researchers, visitors and graduate students supported by PIMS are hosted at one of the sites for the duration of their stay. The event programs include individual lectures, seminar series and scientific meetings. An international scientific review panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/pims-glance/scientific-review-panel PIMS Scientific Review Panel]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adjudicates event applications and decides on the scientific programs. Longer term projects are supported as Collaborative Research Groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/collaborative-research-groups PIMS Collaborative Research Groups]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which will typically include a series of thematic activities such as summer schools and workshops, as well as postdoctoral fellow. PIMS also supports an International Graduate Training Centre (IGTC) which is focused on Mathematical Biology.

== Education and outreach ==
PIMS is involved in all levels of mathematical education from Elementary School onwards. In [[British Columbia]], PIMS organizes the Elementary Math Contest (Elmacon),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmacon.org  Elementary Math Contest Website]. elmacon.org. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an annual competition open to grades 5, 6 and 7. Math Mania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/math-mania  PIMS Math Mania]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is directed at high school students and uses interactive games and demonstrations to introduce students to mathematical concepts. PIMS also runs teacher workshops in many rural areas and conferences. For example, the annual 'Changing the Culture' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/changing-culture  Changing the Culture]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference which brings together teachers and educators to discuss issues and new developments relating mathematics education. Outreach to Aboriginal and First Nations students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/aboriginal-outreach-newsletter PIMS Aboriginal/First Nations outreach programs]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also a strong focus for the BC and Saskatchewan sites, with annual summer camps, programs and resources aimed at providing increased learning opportunities for those students, for example the [http://aboriginalperspectives.uregina.ca/introduction.shtml Aboriginal Perspectives] website established in 2009.

=== mathtube.org ===
In October 2011, PIMS launched a new multimedia site, [http://www.mathtube.org mathtube.org]. This site includes lecture videos, slides and notes from significant PIMS lectures from the past decade, as well as recent events. The site was created to meet the increasing demand to see lecture content online. The site features notable speakers such as [[Edward Witten]], [[Ram Murty]], [[Dusa McDuff]] and [[George C. Papanicolaou|George Papanicolaou]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stanford.edu/~papanico/  George Papanicolaou's personal website]. stanford.edu. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is updated regularly.

'''Phylogeography''' is the study of the historical processes that may be responsible for the contemporary geographic distributions of individuals.  This is accomplished by considering the geographic distribution of individuals in light of [[genetics]], particularly [[population genetics]].&lt;ref name="Avise00"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Avise  | first = J.  | title = Phylogeography: The History and Formation of Species  | publisher = [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]]  | year = 2000  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=lA7YWH4M8FUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=phylogeography&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=  | isbn = 0-674-66638-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term was introduced to describe geographically structured genetic signals within and among [[species]]. An explicit focus on a species' [[biogeography]]/biogeographical past sets phylogeography apart from classical [[population genetics]] and [[phylogenetics]].&lt;ref name="K&amp;M02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knowles, L. L. and [[W. P. Maddison]] |year=2002 |title=Statistical phylogeography |journal=[[Molecular Ecology]] |volume=11 |pages=2623–2635 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01637.x |pmid=12453245 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past events that can be inferred include population expansion, [[population bottlenecks]], [[vicariance]] and [[human migration|migration]]. Recently developed approaches integrating [[coalescent theory]] or the genealogical history of [[alleles]]  and distributional information can more accurately address the relative roles of these different historical forces in shaping current patterns.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T00"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cruzan, M. B |author2=A. R. Templeton  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Paleoecology and coalescence: phylogeographic analysis of hypotheses from the fossil record |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=15 |pages=491–496 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01998-4 |pmid=11114435 |issue=12}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The term phylogeography was first used by [[John Avise]] in his 1987 work ''Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avise|first=J.C.|author2=J Arnold |author3=R M Ball |author4=E Bermingham |author5=T Lamb |author6=J E Neigel |author7=C A Reeb |author8=N C Saunders |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1987|volume=18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.002421 |title=Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics |pages=489–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical biogeography addresses how historical geological, climatic and ecological conditions influenced the current distribution of species. As part of historical biogeography, researchers had been evaluating the geographical and evolutionary relationships of organisms years before. Two developments during the 1960s and 1970s were particularly important in laying the groundwork for modern phylogeography; the first was the spread of [[cladistic]] thought, and the second was the development of [[plate tectonics|plate tectonics theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Queiroz, A. |year=2005 |title=The resurrection of oceanic dispersal in historical biogeography |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=20 |pages=68–73 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.11.006 |pmid=16701345 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting school of thought was vicariance biogeography, which explained the origin of new lineages through geological events like the drifting apart of continents or the formation of rivers. When a continuous population (or species) is divided by a new river or a new mountain range (i.e., a vicariance event), two populations (or species) are created. [[Paleogeography]], [[geology]] and [[paleoecology]] are all important fields that supply information that is integrated into phylogeographic analyses.

Phylogeography takes a [[population genetic]]s and [[phylogenetic]] perspective on [[biogeography]]. In the mid-1970s, population genetic analyses turned to mitochondrial markers.&lt;ref name="Avise98"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Avise, J. C. |year=1998 |title=The history and purview of phylogeography: a personal reflection |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=371–379 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00391.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the process where millions of copies of a [[DNA]] segment can be replicated, was crucial in the development of phylogeography.

Thanks to this breakthrough, the information contained in mitochondrial DNA sequences was much more accessible. Advances in both laboratory methods (e.g. [[capillary]] [[DNA sequencing]] technology) that allowed easier sequencing DNA and computational methods that make better use of the data (e.g. employing [[coalescent theory]]) have helped improve phylogeographic inference.&lt;ref name="Avise98" /&gt;

Early phylogeographic work has recently been criticized for its narrative nature and lack of [[statistical]] rigor ([[i.e.]] it did not statistically test alternative hypotheses). The only real method was [[Alan Templeton]]'s Nested Clade Analysis, which made use of an inference key to determine the validity of a given process in explaining the concordance between geographic distance and genetic relatedness. Recent approaches have taken a stronger statistical approach to phylogeography than was done initially.&lt;ref name="K&amp;M02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A. R., E. Routman, and C. A. Phillips |year=1995 |title=Separating Population Structure from Population History: A Cladistic Analysis of the Geographical Distribution of Mitochondrial DNA Haplotypes in the Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma Tigrinum |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |volume=140 |pages=767–782 |pmid=7498753 |issue=2 |pmc=1206651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A.

'''Example'''

Climate change, such as the glaciation cycles of the past 2.4 million years, has periodically restricted some species into disjunct refugia. These restricted ranges may result in [[population bottlenecks]] that reduce genetic variation. Once a reversal in climate change allows for rapid migration out of refugial areas, these species spread rapidly into newly available habitat. A number of empirical studies find genetic signatures of both animal and plant species that support this scenario of refugia and postglacial expansion.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T00" /&gt; This has occurred both in the tropics (where the main effect of glaciation is increasing [[arid]]ity, i.e. the expansion of savanna and retraction of [[tropical rainforest]])&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schneider, C. J., M. Cunningham and C. Moritz |year=1998 |title=Comparative phylogeography and the history of endemic vertebrates in the Wet Tropics rainforests of Australia |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=487–498 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00334.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Da Silva, M.

Fumagalli, A.-G. Wust-Saucy, and J.-F. Cossons |year=1998 |title=Comparative phylogeography and postglacial colonization routes in Europe |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=453–464 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00289.x |pmid=9628000 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeography and conservation==
Phylogeography can help in the prioritization of areas of high value for conservation. Phylogeographic analyses have also played an important role in defining [[evolutionary significant unit]]s (ESU), a unit of conservation below the species level that is often defined on unique geographic distribution and mitochondrial genetic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moritz, C. |year=1994 |title=Defining "evolutionary significant units" for conservation |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=9 |pages=373–375 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(94)90057-4 |issue=10 |pmid=21236896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study on imperiled cave [[crayfish]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of eastern North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buhay, J. E.  |author2=K. A. Crandall  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Subterranean phylogeography of freshwater crayfishes shows extensive gene flow and surprisingly large population sizes |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=14 | pages=4259–4273 |pmid=16313591 |issue=14 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02755.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how phylogenetic analyses along with geographic distribution can aid in recognizing conservation priorities. Using phylogeographical approaches, the authors found that hidden within what was thought to be a single, widely distributed species, an ancient and previously undetected species was also present. Conservation decisions can now be made to ensure that both lineages received protection. Results like this are not an uncommon outcome from phylogeographic studies.

An analysis of [[salamanders]] of the genus ''[[Eurycea]]'', also in the Appalachians, found that the current taxonomy of the group greatly underestimated species level diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kozak, K. H., A. B. Russell and A. Larson |year=2006 |title=Gene lineages and eastern North American paleodrainage basins: phylogeography and speciation in salamanders of the ''Eurycea bislineata'' species complex |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |pages=191–207 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02757.x |pmid=16367840 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study also found that patterns of phylogeographic diversity were more associated with historical (rather than modern) drainage connections, indicating that major shifts in the drainage patterns of the region played an important role in the generation of diversity of these salamanders. A thorough understanding of phylogeographic structure will thus allow informed choices in prioritizing areas for conservation.

==Comparative phylogeography==
[[File:Phylogeography poisonfrogs.jpg|thumb|450px|These figures map out the phylogeographic history of [[Poison dart frog|poison frogs]] in South America.]]

The field of comparative phylogeography seeks to explain the mechanisms responsible for the phylogenetic relationships and distribution of ''different'' species. For example, comparisons across multiple taxa can clarify the histories of biogeographical regions.&lt;ref name="Riginos"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riginos, C. |year=2005 |title=Cryptic vicariance in Gulf of California fishes parallels vicariant patterns found in Baja California mammals and reptiles |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=59 | pages=2678–2690 |doi=10.1554/05-257.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, phylogeographic analyses of terrestrial vertebrates on the [[Baja California]] peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riddle, B. R., D. J. Hafner, L. F. Alexander, and J. R. Jaeger |year=2000 |title=Cryptic vicariance in the historical assembly of a Baja California Peninsular Desert biota |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=97 |pages=14438–14443 |doi=10.1073/pnas.250413397 |pmid=11095731 |issue=26 |pmc=18937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marine fish on both the Pacific and gulf sides of the peninsula&lt;ref name="Riginos" /&gt; display genetic signatures that suggest a vicariance event affected multiple taxa during the [[Pleistocene]] or [[Pliocene]].

Phylogeography also gives an important historical perspective on community composition. History is relevant to regional and local diversity in two ways.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt; One, the size and makeup of the regional [[species pool]] results from the balance of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]]. Two, at a local level community composition is influenced by the interaction between local extinction of species’ populations and recolonization.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt; A comparative phylogenetic approach in the Australian Wet Tropics indicates that regional patterns of species distribution and diversity are largely determined by local extinctions and subsequent recolonizations corresponding to climatic cycles.

Phylogeography integrates biogeography and genetics to study in greater detail the lineal history of a species in context of the geoclimatic history of the planet. An example study of poison frogs living in the South American [[neotropics]] (illustrated to the left) is used to demonstrate how phylogeographers combine [[genetics]] and [[paleogeography]] to piece together the ecological history of organisms in their environments. Several major geoclimatic events have greatly influenced the biogeographic distribution of organisms in this area, including [[Great American Interchange|the isolation and reconnection of South America]], the uplift of the Andes, an extensive [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] floodbasin system during the Miocene, the formation of [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River#Drainage area|Amazon drainages]], and dry−wet climate cycles throughout the [[Pliocene]] to [[Pleistocene]] epochs.&lt;ref name="Santos09"/&gt;

The phylogeographers visited the ranges of each frog species to obtain tissue samples for genetic analysis; researchers can also obtain tissue samples from museum collections.

The evolutionary history and relations among different poison frog species is reconstructed using [[phylogenetic tree]]s derived from molecular data. The molecular trees are mapped in relation to paleogeographic history of the region for a complete phylogeographic study. The tree shown in the center of the figure has its branch lengths calibrated to a [[molecular clock]], with the geological time bar shown at the bottom. The same phylogenetic tree is duplicated four more times to show where each lineage is distributed and is found (illustrated in the inset maps below, including Amazon basin, Andes, Guiana-Venezuela, Central America-Chocó).&lt;ref name="Santos09"/&gt;

The combination of techniques used in this study exemplifies more generally how phylogeographic studies proceed and test for patterns of common influence. Paleogeographic data establishes geological time records for historical events that explain the branching patterns in the molecular trees. This study rejected the null model and found that the origin for all extant Amazonian poison frog species primarily stem from fourteen lineages that dispersed into their respective areas after the Miocene floodbasin receded.&lt;ref name="Santos09" /&gt; Regionally based phylogeographic studies of this type are repeated for different species as a means of independent testing. Phylogeographers find broadly concordant and repeated patterns among species in most regions of the planet that is due to a common influence of [[paleoclimatic]] history.&lt;ref name="Avise00"/&gt;

==Human phylogeography==
{{main|Recent single-origin hypothesis|Multiregional hypothesis}}
Phylogeography has also proven to be useful in understanding the origin and dispersal patterns of our own species, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Based primarily on observations of skeletal remains of ancient human remains and estimations of their age, anthropologists proposed two competing hypotheses about human origins.

The first hypothesis is referred to as the '''[[Recent single-origin hypothesis|Out-of-Africa with replacement]]''' model, which contends that the last expansion out of [[Africa]] around 100,000 years ago resulted in the modern humans displacing all previous ''Homo'' spp. populations in [[Eurasia]] that were the result of an earlier wave of emigration out of Africa. The '''[[Multiregional hypothesis|multiregional]]''' scenario claims that individuals from the recent expansion out of Africa intermingled genetically with those human populations of more ancient African emigrations. 
A phylogeographic study that uncovered a '''[[Mitochondrial Eve]]''' that lived in Africa 150,000 years ago provided early support for the Out-of-Africa model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cann, R.L., Stoneking, M., and A. C. Wilson |year=1987 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=325 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1038/325031a0 |pmid=3025745 |issue=6099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this study had its shortcomings, it received significant attention both within scientific circles and a wider audience. A more thorough phylogeographic analysis that used ten different genes instead of a single mitochondrial marker indicates that at least two major expansions out of Africa after the initial range extension of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' played an important role shaping the modern human gene pool and that recurrent genetic exchange is pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A. R. |year=2002|url=http://www.bioguider.com/ebook/biology/pdf/Templeton_n2002.pdf |title=Out of Africa again and again |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=416 |pages=45–51 |doi=10.1038/416045a |issue=6876}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings strongly demonstrated Africa's central role in the [[evolution]] of modern humans, but also indicated that the multiregional model had some validity. These studies have largely been supplanted by population genomic studies that use orders of magnitude more data.

In light of these recent data from the 1000 genomes project, genomic-scale SNP databases sampling thousands of individuals globally and samples taken from two non-Homo sapiens hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans), the picture of human evolutionary has become more resolved and complex involving possible Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture, admixture with archaic African hominins, and Eurasian expansion into the Australasian region that predates the standard out of African expansion.

==Phylogeography of viruses==
Viruses are informative in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change due to their rapid mutation rate and fast generation time.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, E. C. |year=2004 |title=The phylogeography of human viruses |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=13 |pages=745–756 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02051.x |pmid=15012753 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogeography is a useful tool in understanding the origins and distributions of different viral strains. A phylogeographic approach has been taken for many diseases that threaten human health, including [[dengue fever]], [[rabies]], [[influenza]] and [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Holmes" /&gt; Similarly, a phylogeographic approach will likely play a key role in understanding the vectors and spread of [[avian influenza]] ([[HPAI H5N1]]), demonstrating the relevance of phylogeography to the general public.

==Phylogeography of languages==
Phylogeographic analysis of ancient and modern languages has been used to test whether [[Indo-European languages]] originated in [[Anatolia]] or in the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mapping the Origins and Expansion of the Indo-European Language Family | journal = Science | date = 24 Aug 2012 | first = Remco | last = Bouckaert |author2=Philippe Lemey |author3=Michael Dunn |author4=Simon J.

Combining those data with known geographic ranges of each language produced strong support for an Anatolian origin approximately 8000–9500 years ago.

In [[telecommunication]], '''receive-after-transmit time delay''' is the [[time]] interval between (a) the instant of [[keying (telecommunications)|keying]] off the local transmitter to stop transmitting and (b) the instant the local receiver output has increased to 90% of its steady-state value in response to an RF (radio-frequency) [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] from another transmitter.  

The RF signal from the distant transmitter must exist at the local receiver input prior to, or at the time of, keying off the local transmitter. 

Receive-after-transmit time delay applies only to [[half-duplex operation]].

==Scientific contributions==

===Long short-term memory (LSTM)===
Sepp Hochreiter developed the [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) for which the first results were reported in his diploma thesis in 1991.&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt; The main LSTM paper appeared in 1997&lt;ref name="Neco"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochreiter | first1 = S. | last2 = Schmidhuber | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735 | title = Long Short-Term Memory | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1735–1780 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9377276| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered as a discovery that is a milestone in the [[timeline of machine learning]].  LSTM overcomes the problem of [[recurrent neural networks]] (RNNs) and deep networks to forget information over time or, equivalently, through layers ([[Vanishing gradient problem|vanishing or exploding gradient]]).&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hochreiter:1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hochreiter:2000book /&gt;
LSTM [[learning|learns]] from training sequences to process new sequences in order to produce an output (sequence classification) or generate an output sequence (sequence to sequence mapping). Neural networks with LSTM cells solved numerous tasks in [[biomolecular structure|biological sequence]] analysis,  [[drug design]], automatic [[music composition]], [[machine translation]], [[speech recognition]], reinforcement learning, and [[robotics]].
LSTM with an optimized architecture was successfully applied to very fast
protein [[homology modeling|homology]] detection without requiring a [[sequence alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochreiter | first1 = S. | last2 = Heusel | first2 = M. | last3 = Obermayer | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm247 | title = Fast model-based protein homology detection without alignment | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 23 | issue = 14 | pages = 1728–1736 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17488755| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
LSTM has been used to learn a learning algorithm, that is, LSTM serves as a Turing machine, i.e. as a computer, on which a learning algorithm is executed. Since the LSTM Turing machine is a neural network, it can develop novel learning algorithms by learning on learning problems. It turns out that the learned new learning techniques are superior to those designed by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hochreiter|first1=S.|last2=Younger|first2=A. S.|last3=Conwell|first3=P.

===Deep learning and learning representations===
[[Neural networks]] are different [[Types of artificial neural networks|types]]
of simplified mathematical models of [[biological neural network]]s like
those in [[human brain]]s. 
In [[feedforward neural networks]] (NNs) the information moves forward in only one direction, 
from the input layer that receives information from the environment, 
through the hidden layers to the output layer that supplies the information to the environment.
Unlike NNs, [[recurrent neural networks]] (RNNs) 
can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. 
If [[data mining]] is based on neural networks, [[overfitting]] reduces the network's capability to correctly process future data. To avoid overfitting, Sepp Hochreiter
developed algorithms for finding low complexity neural networks like "Flat Minimum Search"
(FMS),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochreiter | first1 = S. | last2 = Schmidhuber | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.1 | title = Flat Minima | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–42 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9117894| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which searches for a "flat" minimum — a large connected region in the parameter space where the
network function is constant. Thus, the network parameters can be given with low precision which
means a low complex network that avoids overfitting. Low complexity neural networks are well suited for [[deep learning]] because they control the complexity in each network layer and, therefore, learn [[learning representation|hierarchical representations]] of the input.&lt;ref name="HochreiterSchmidhuber1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hochreiter|first1=S.|last2=Schmidhuber|first2=J.|title=Feature Extraction Through LOCOCODE|journal=Neural Computation|volume=11|issue=3|year=1999|pages=679–714|issn=0899-7667|doi=10.1162/089976699300016629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Hochreiter |first=S.|last2=Schmidhuber |first2=J. |title=Source Separation as a By-product of Regularization 
|conference=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 12 |date=1999 |pages=459–465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sepp Hochreiter's group introduced "exponential linear units" (ELUs) which speed up learning in deep neural networks and lead to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs), and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to ReLUs, due to negative values which push mean unit activations closer to zero. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect.&lt;ref&gt;

networks (SNNs) which allow for feedforward networks abstract representations of the input
on different levels.
SNNs avoid problems of batch normalization since the activations across samples
automatically converge to mean zero and variance one.
SNNs an enabling technology to
(1) train very deep networks, that is, networks with
many layers,
(2) use novel regularization strategies, and
(3) learn very robustly across many layers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] deep learning, 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very popular since they 
create new images which are more realistic than those of obtained from other generative approaches.
Sepp Hochreiter proposed 
a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for learning GANs with stochastic gradient descent 
on any differentiable loss function.
Methods from stochastic approximation have been used to prove 
that the TTUR converges to a stationary local Nash equilibrium.
This is the first proof of the convergence of GANs in a general setting. 
Another contribution is the introduction of
the "Fréchet Inception Distance" (FID) which is a more appropriate
quality measure for GANs than the previously used Inception Score.&lt;ref&gt;

learn by "backpropagation through a model".&lt;ref name="report"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this approach has major drawbacks stemming from
sensitivity analysis like
local minima, various instabilities when learning online,
exploding and vanishing gradients of world model, 
neither contribution nor relevance for the reward is assigned to
actions.
Sepp Hochreiter introduced "RUDDER: Return Decomposition for Delayed Rewards"
which is designed to learn optimal policies for [[Markov Decision Processes]] (MDPs) with highly delayed rewards.
For delayed rewards, he proved that the biases of action-value estimates learned by
[[temporal difference]] (TD) are corrected only exponentially slowly
in the number of delay steps. 
Furthermore, he proved that the variance of an action-value estimate that is
learned via [[Monte Carlo methods]] (MC) increases other estimation variances,
the number of which can grow exponentially with the number of delay steps.
RUDDER solves both the exponentially slow bias correction of TD and the
increase of exponentially many variances of MC by a return decomposition.
A new RUDDER-constructed MDP has the same return for each episode and policy as the original
MDP but the rewards are redistributed along the
episode. The redistribution leads to largely reduced delays of the rewards. 
In the optimal case, the new MDP has no delayed rewards and TD is
unbiased. The redistributed rewards aim to track Q-values in order to
keep the future expected reward always at zero. Therefore an action
that increases the expected return receives a positive reward and an
action that decreased the expected return receives a negative reward.
RUDDER consists of (I) a safe exploration strategy, (II) a lessons
replay buffer, and (III) an LSTM-based reward redistribution method
via return decomposition and backward contribution analysis.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Drug discovery, target prediction, and toxicology ===
The [[pharmaceutical industry|pharma industry]] sees many [[chemical compounds]] (drug candidates) fail in late phases of the drug development pipeline. These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy on the [[Biological target|biomolecular target]] (on-target effect), undesired interactions with other [[biomolecules]] (off-target or side effects), or unpredicted [[cytotoxicity|toxic effects]]. The Deep Learning and biclustering methods developed by Sepp Hochreiter identified novel on- and off-target effects in various drug design projects.&lt;ref name="VerbistKlambauer2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbist|first1=B.|last2=Klambauer|first2=G.|last3=Vervoort|first3=L.|last4=Talloen|first4=W.|last5=Shkedy|first5=Z.|last6=Thas|first6=O.|last7=Bender|first7=A.|last8=Göhlmann|first8=H.W.H.|last9=Hochreiter|first9=S.|title=Using transcriptomics to guide lead optimization in drug discovery projects: Lessons learned from the QSTAR project|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=20|issue=5|year=2015|pages=505–513|issn=1359-6446|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2014.12.014|pmid=25582842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Sepp Hochreiter's group won the DREAM subchallenge of predicting the average toxicity of compounds.&lt;ref name="EduatiMangravite2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eduati|first1=F.|last2=Mangravite|first2=L.

A bicluster in transcriptomic data is a pair of a gene set and a sample set for which the genes are similar to each other on the samples and vice versa. In drug design, for example, the effects of compounds may be similar only on a subgroup of genes. FABIA is a multiplicative model that assumes realistic non-Gaussian signal distributions with [[heavy tails]] and utilizes well understood model selection techniques like a variational approach in the Bayesian framework. FABIA supplies the [[information theory|information content]] of each bicluster to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters. Sepp Hochreiter edited the reference book on biclustering which presents the most relevant biclustering algorithms, typical applications of biclustering, visualization and evaluation of biclusters, and software in R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Support vector machines===
[[Support vector machines]] (SVMs) are [[supervised learning]] methods used for
[[classification (machine learning)|classification]] and [[regression analysis]] by recognizing patterns and regularities in the data. Standard SVMs require a positive definite
kernel to generate a squared kernel matrix from the data. Sepp Hochreiter proposed the "Potential Support Vector Machine" (PSVM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochreiter | first1 = S. | last2 = Obermayer | first2 = K. | doi = 10.1162/neco.2006.18.6.1472 | title = Support Vector Machines for Dyadic Data | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1472–1510 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16764511| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be applied to non-square kernel matrices and can be used with kernels that are not positive definite. For PSVM model selection he developed an efficient [[sequential minimal optimization]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knebel | first1 = T. | last2 = Hochreiter | first2 = S. | last3 = Obermayer | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1162/neco.2008.20.1.271 | title = An SMO Algorithm for the Potential Support Vector Machine | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 271–287 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18045009| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSVM minimizes a new objective which ensures theoretical bounds on the generalization error and automatically selects features which are used for classification or regression.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for detecting short segments of [[identity by descent]]. A [[DNA]] segment is [[Identity by type|identical by state]] (IBS) in two or more individuals if they have identical [[nucleotide]] sequences in this segment. An IBS segment is identical by descent (IBD) in two or more
individuals if they have [[Inheritance|inherited]] it from a common [[ancestor]], that is, the segment has the same ancestral origin in these individuals. HapFABIA identifies 100 times smaller IBD segments than current state-of-the-art methods: 10kbp for HapFABIA vs. 1Mbp for state-of-the-art methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">The '''SkyScout''' is an electronic astronomical instrument made by [[Celestron]]. It is intended primarily as an educational device to help users locate and identify celestial objects.

==Device Description==
The SkyScout is a handheld, battery powered device about 7.4" x 4.0" x 2.5", and weighs about 1 pound. It has a viewing port, a 3" x 1" LCD display on the side and several buttons for controlling and selecting device functions.

==Operation==
The SkyScout has a 12 channel [[GPS]] receiver and orientation sensors that measure location and pointing angle. From an internal database of some 6,000 celestial objects an object is identified simply by centering it in the device's zero-power optical finder and pressing a button. The [[LCD]] screen displays the name of the object (star, planet, deep sky object, etc.) and other relevant data. An audio presentation is available via earphones on 200 of the most popular celestial objects.

The SkyScout will also locate an object; the user selects the desired object from the database and red arrows in the viewfinder direct the user to point the viewfinder to the object. The SkyScout also features a "Tonight's Highlights" mode, leading the user through the night's best objects.

==Expandability==
The database can be expanded with extra plug-in SD data cards. A USB connection is also provided for online updates of the object database and device firmware.

==Price and availability==
The SkyScout was announced at the January 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], and became available in July 2006. It has a retail cost of $675, but is available at prices as low as $250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telescopes.com/telescope-accessories/general-accessories/celestronskyscoutpersonalplanetarium.cfm Celestron SkyScout Personal Planetarium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Skyscout has been known to scratch easily, and battery life is short at about one-half hour. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.
The sensors inside of it were far too twitchy around anything metal and made it difficult to use.  The advent of [[iPhone]]/[[Android (operating system)|Android]] and associated astronomy apps have somewhat eliminated the need for this device. Note: the Celestron SkyScout's database extended up to Jan 1, 2016. The SkyScout is unsupported by Celestron and no longer works as designed.

'''Tony (Anthony) Steuer''', CLU, LA, CPFFE (born 1964) is an American financial [[author]], blogger, insurance consumer [[advocate]] and founder of the Insurance Bill of Rights Movement. He is best known for his ''Questions and Answers on Life Insurance'' book series. He has written five books since 2010, two of which have received the Excellence in Financial Literacy Education Award.

He is currently a regular contributor to websites including: [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/10/your-money/10money.html]''The New York Times'', reviews.com, bankrate.com, foxbusiness.com, yahoo.com, black enterprise.com, usnews.com, nytimes.com, washingtonpost.com, wisebread.com, forbes.com and mint.com. He also appears regularly on Bottom Line Personal, investopedia.com, A.M Best Review, insurancethoughtleadership.com, thinkadvisor.com, financialfinesse.com, ''[[Nolo.com]]'', ''The Nest'', and ''Love to Know''., beyondtype1.org and insulinnation.com.

He is currently a frequent guest contributor on national radio shows, including ''The Prudent Money Show'' and ''Your Financial Editor'', where he provides non-biased advice on life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prudentmoney.com/podcast/112409-PrudentMoney.mp3/]''Prudent Money Radio Show''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeinsurancetoolbook.com/slideshare/podcasts]''Podcast from Your Financial Editor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written and published free financial literacy tools available on his blog and website.

== Activism ==

Steuer is known as a spokesperson and leader in the financial literacy movement. In 2016, Steuer’s son (age 11) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Faced with a chronic illness that requires constant maintenance, Steuer realized his own son could be denied insurance coverage under the health care plan proposed by President Donald Trump. This led him to author the petition Fair Health Insurance For All, described as a petition to the U.S. Senate to seek a “solution” to health insurance costs. And that “any solution should simplify and seek to reduce costs while maintaining and increasing benefits.”

Steuer also authored The Insurance Bill of Rights, which is designed to empower consumers, and provides a Best Practices Roadmap for members of the insurance industry.

== Early life and education ==

Steuer was born on March 8, 1964, in [[San Francisco]], California.  He was raised in San Francisco and later moved to Marin County where attended Redwood High School.  He attended [[California State University Chico]] where he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business (Finance) and was an intern for a free legal information service on campus, C.L.I.C. (Community Legal Information Center).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aschico.com/CLIC] Community Legal Information Center&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) Designation in the late 1980s and the Certified Personal and Family Finance Educator (CPFFE) from the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences in 2012. Steuer is one of 40 licensed Life and Disability Insurance agents from the California Department of Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0200-industry/0050-renew-license/0200-requirements/life-disability.cfm]''California Department of Insurance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Prior to becoming an author and insurance consumer advocate, Steuer was an assistant vice president with Acordia-Lloyd, a multi-line insurance brokerage firm.  He started his own practice in 1995.

== Writing ==
Tony is the award-winning author of five books, including two consecutive Excellence in Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Awards: Questions and Answers on Life Insurance and The Questions and Answers on Life Insurance Workbook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifleawards.org/hall-of-fame/2011-winners/] 2011 Excellence In Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifleawards.org/hall-of-fame/2012-winners/] 2012 Excellence In Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Forest Service''' ('''USFS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] that administers the nation's 154 [[United States National Forest|national forests]] and 20 [[United States National Grassland|national grasslands]], which encompass {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/newsroom/by-the-numbers|title=By the Numbers {{!}} US Forest Service|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch.&lt;ref name=organization/&gt; Managing approximately 25% of [[federal lands]], it is the only major national land agency that is outside the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="gao.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=General Accounting Office|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-223|title=Federal Land Management: Observations on a Possible Move of the Forest Service into the Department of the Interior|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the United States Forest Service}}

The concept of the National Forests was born from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation group, [[Boone and Crockett Club]], due to concerns regarding [[Yellowstone National Park]] beginning as early as 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=William G.|title=History of the Boone and Crockett Club Pg 64-80|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1000&amp;context=sheldon&amp;type=additional|website=Scholar Works, University of Montana|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=1 February 2017|ref=Pg. 65-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Congress created the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. [[Franklin B. Hough]] was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed '''Division of Forestry'''. The [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as "forest reserves," managed by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the '''Bureau of Forestry'''. The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the [[General Land Office]] of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry, henceforth known as the '''United States Forest Service'''. [[Gifford Pinchot]] was the first [[United States Chief Foresters|United States Chief Forester]] in the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt]].

Significant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the [[Weeks Act]] of 1911, the [[Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960]], P.L. 86-517; the [[Wilderness Act]], P.L. 88-577; the [[National Forest Management Act]], P.L. 94-588; the [[National Environmental Policy Act]], P.L. 91-190; the [[Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act]], P.L. 95-313; and the [[Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act]], P.L. 95-307.

In February 2009, the [[Government Accountability Office]] evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the [[National Park Service]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], and the [[Bureau of Land Management]], managing some {{convert|438000000|acre|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name="gao.gov"/&gt;

== Organization ==

=== Overview ===
As of 2009, the Forest Service has a total budget authority of $5.5 billion, of which 42% is spent fighting fires. The Forest Service employs 34,250 employees in 750 locations, including 10,050 firefighters, 737 law enforcement personnel, and 500 scientists.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/documents/USFS_An_Overview_0106MJS.pdf|title=The U.S. Forest Service - An Overview|publisher=U.S. Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Forest Service is "To sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Its motto is "Caring for the land and serving people." As the lead federal agency in natural resource conservation, the US Forest Service provides leadership in the protection, management, and use of the nation's forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems. The agency's ecosystem approach to management integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment to meet current and future needs. Through implementation of land and resource management plans, the agency ensures sustainable ecosystems by restoring and maintaining species diversity and ecological productivity that helps provide recreation, water, timber, minerals, fish, wildlife, wilderness, and aesthetic values for current and future generations of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20heinrich.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clear-Cutting the Truth About Trees | first=Bernd | last=Heinrich | date=December 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday work of the Forest Service balances resource extraction, resource protection, and providing recreation. The work includes managing {{convert|193000000|acres|km2}} of national forest and grasslands, including {{convert|59000000|acres|km2}} of [[roadless area]]s; 14,077 recreation sites; {{convert|143346|mi|km}} of trails; {{convert|374883|mi|km}} of roads; and the harvesting of 1.5 billion trees per year.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Further, the Forest Service fought fires on {{convert|2996000|acres|km2}} of land in 2007.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The Forest Service organization includes ranger districts, national forests, regions, research stations and research work units and the Northeastern Area Office for State and Private Forestry. Each level has responsibility for a variety of functions.

=== National Places ===
The Chief of the Forest Service is a career federal employee who oversees the entire agency. The Chief reports to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), an appointee of the President confirmed by the Senate. The Chief's staff provides broad policy and direction for the agency, works with the Administration to develop a budget to submit to Congress, provides information to Congress on accomplishments, and monitors activities of the agency. There are five deputy chiefs for the following areas: National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Research and Development, Business Operations, and Finance.

=== Research stations and research work units ===
[[File:U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|left|The Forest Products Laboratory, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]
The [[Forest Service Research and Development]] deputy area includes five research stations, the [[Forest Products Laboratory]], and the [[International Institute of Tropical Forestry]], in Puerto Rico. Station directors, like regional foresters, report to the Chief. Research stations include Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southern. There are 92 research work units located at 67 sites throughout the United States. there are 80 Experimental Forests and Ranges that have been established progressively since 1908; many sites are more than 50 years old. The system provides places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types of the {{convert|195|e6acre|km2}} of public land administered by the Forest Service. Individual sites range from 47 to 22,500&amp;nbsp;ha  in size.

Operations of Experimental Forests and Ranges are directed by local research teams for the individual sites, by Research Stations for the regions in which they are located, and at the level of the Forest Service.

Major themes in research at the Experimental Forests and Ranges includes:
develop of systems for managing and restoring forests, range lands, and watersheds; investigate the workings of forest and stream ecosystems; characterize plant and animal communities; observe and interpret long-term environmental change and many other themes.

=== Regions ===
[[File:USFS regions map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the nine regions]]
There are nine regions in the USDA Forest Service; numbered 1 through 10 (Region 7 was eliminated
in 1965 when the current Eastern Region was created from the former Eastern and
North Central regions.&lt;ref&gt;The Land We Cared for... A History of the Forest Service's Eastern Region.
1997, Conrad, David E., Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;
). Each encompasses a broad geographic area and is headed by a regional forester who reports directly to the Chief. The regional forester has broad responsibility for coordinating activities among the various forests within the region, for providing overall leadership for regional natural resource and social programs, and for coordinated regional land use planning.
*'''Northern Region''': based in [[Missoula, Montana]], the Northern Region (R1) covers six states (Montana, Northern Idaho, North Dakota, Northwestern South Dakota, Northeast Washington, and Northwest Wyoming), twelve National Forests and one National Grassland.
* '''Rocky Mountain''': based in [[Golden, Colorado]], the Rocky Mountain Region (R2) covers five states (Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and most of Wyoming and South Dakota), sixteen National Forests and seven National Grasslands.
*'''Southwestern''': based in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], the Southwestern Region (R3) covers two states (New Mexico and Arizona) and eleven National Forests.
*'''Intermountain''': based in [[Ogden, Utah]], the Intermountain Region (R4) covers four states (Southern Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Western Wyoming), twelve national forests.
*'''Pacific Southwest''': based in [[Vallejo, California]], The Pacific Southwest Region (R5) covers two states (California and Hawaii), eighteen National Forests and one Management Unit.
* '''Pacific Northwest''': based in [[Portland, Oregon]] the Pacific Northwest Region (R6) covers two states (Washington and Oregon), seventeen National Forests and one National Scenic Area.
* '''Southern''': based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the Southern Region (R8) covers thirteen states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia; and Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands), and thirty-four National Forests.
* '''Eastern''': based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], the Eastern Region (R9) covers twenty states (Maine, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, and New Jersey), seventeen National Forests, one Grassland and America's Outdoors Center for Conservation, Recreation, and Resources.
* '''Alaska''': based in [[Juneau, Alaska]], the Alaska Region (R10) covers one state (Alaska), and two National Forests.

=== National Forest or Grassland ===
{{further|List of U.S. National Forests|United States National Grassland}}
The Forest Service oversees 155 national forests and 20 grasslands. Each administrative unit typically comprises several ranger districts, under the overall direction of a forest supervisor. Within the supervisor's office, the staff coordinates activities among districts, allocates the budget, and provides technical support to each district. Forest supervisors are line officers and report to regional foresters.

=== Ranger District ===
The Forest Service has over 600 ranger districts. Each district has a staff of 10 to 100 people under the direction of a district ranger, a line officer who reports to a forest supervisor. The districts vary in size from {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}}. Most on-the-ground activities occur on ranger districts, including trail construction and maintenance, operation of campgrounds, and management of vegetation and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;{{USFS|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/organization|article=Agency Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major divisions ==

=== Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations ===
[[File:United States Forest Service LEI Patch.gif|thumb|Patch of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]
[[File:United States Forest Service Horse patrol.jpg|thumb|A horse patrol of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]

The U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit (LEI), headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a [[List of law enforcement agencies|federal law enforcement agency]] of the U.S. government. It is responsible for enforcement of federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. All Law Enforcement Officers and Special Agents Receive their training through [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC).

Operations are divided into two major functional areas:
* Law enforcement: uniformed, high-visibility enforcement of laws
* Investigations: [[special agent]]s who investigate crimes against property, visitors, and employees

Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) enforce federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. LEOs also enforce some or all state laws on National Forest Lands. As part of that mission, LEOs carry firearms, defensive equipment, make arrests, execute [[search warrant]]s, complete reports, and testify in court. They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands, roads, and recreation sites. The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources, protection of Forest Service employees and the protection of visitors. To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction, they use [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, special service [[SUV]]s, horses, [[Police dog|K-9 units]], helicopters, [[snowmobile]]s, dirt bikes, and boats.

[[Special Agents]] are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the Forest Service and other statues under the [[United States Code]]. Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms, and other defensive equipment, make arrests, carry out complex criminal investigations, present cases for prosecution to [[U.S. Attorneys]], and prepare investigative reports. All field agents are required to travel a great deal and usually maintain a case load of ten to fifteen ongoing criminal investigations at one time. Criminal investigators occasionally conduct internal and civil claim investigations.

=== National Forest System ===
[[File:106mm Recoilless Rifle.jpg|thumb|left|Forest Service team uses a 106&amp;nbsp;mm [[Recoilless Rifle]] for [[avalanche control]] at [[Mammoth Mountain]] in the [[Inyo National Forest]] in [[California]]. Note the [[Minarets (California)|Minarets]] in background.]]
The {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}} of public land that are managed as national forests and [[grassland]]s are collectively known as the National Forest System. These lands are located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, and the [[Virgin Islands]] and comprise about 9% of the total land area in the United States. The lands are organized into 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands. The mission of the National Forest System is to protect and manage the forest lands so they best demonstrate the sustainable multiple-use management concept, using an ecological approach, to meet the diverse needs of people.

=== State and Private Forestry ===
The mission of the State and Private Forestry program is to provide technical and financial assistance to private landowners, state agencies, tribes, and community resource managers to help sustain the United States' urban and rural forests and to protect communities and the environment from wildland fires, insects, disease, and [[Invasive species|invasive]] plants. The program employs approximately 537 staff located at 17 sites throughout the country. The delivery of the State and Private Forestry program is carried out by eight National Forest System regions and the Northeastern Area.

=== Research and development ===
[[File:USFS PNW lab.jpg|thumb|right|The U.S. Forest Service [[R&amp;D]] lab in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington]]
The [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service works to improve the health and use of the United States' forests and [[grassland]]s. Research has been part of the Forest Service mission since the agency's inception in 1905. Today, Forest Service researchers work in a range of biological, physical, and social science fields to promote sustainable management of United States' diverse forests and rangelands. Research employs about 550 scientists and several hundred technical and support staff, located at 67 sites throughout the United States and in [[Puerto Rico]]. Discovery and technology development and transfer is carried out through seven research stations.

Research focuses on informing policy and land management decisions and includes addressing [[Invasive species|invasive]] insects, degraded [[river ecosystem]]s, or sustainable ways to harvest forest products. The researchers work independently and with a range of partners, including other agencies, academia, nonprofit groups, and industry. The information and technology produced through basic and applied science programs is available to the public for its benefit and use.

In addition to the Research Stations, the USFS R&amp;D branch also leads several National Centers such as the [[National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation]].

=== International programs ===
The Forest Service plays a key role in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources. It works closely with other agencies such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]], and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], as well as with nonprofit development organizations, wildlife organizations, universities, and international assistance organizations. The Forest Service's international work serves to link people and communities striving to protect and manage forests throughout the world. The program also promotes [[sustainable land management]] overseas and brings important technologies and innovations back to the United States. The program focuses on conserving key natural resource in cooperation with countries across the world.

== Activities ==
[[File:US-national-forest-service-lands.png|thumb|350px|left|More than 80% of the 193 million acres (780,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land managed by the United States Forest Service is in the western states.

Although a large volume of [[Lumber|timber]] is [[Logging|logged]] every year, not all [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] are entirely forested. There are tidewater glaciers in the [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] and ski areas such as [[Alta, Utah]] in the [[Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. In addition, the Forest Service is responsible for managing [[National Grassland]]s in the midwest. Furthermore, areas designated as wilderness by acts of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], prohibit logging, mining, road and building construction and land leases for purposes of farming and or livestock grazing.

Since 1978, several [[President of the United States|Presidents]] have directed the USFS to administer  [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]] inside of preexisting National Forests.

* [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] – California
* [[Misty Fjords National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] – Washington
* [[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] – Oregon
* [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] – California (jointly with the [[Bureau of Land Management]])

The Forest Service also manages [[Grey Towers National Historic Site]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], the home and estate of its first Chief, [[Gifford Pinchot]].

=== Fighting fires ===
{{See also|History of wildfire suppression in the United States}}
[[File:Smokey3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Smokey Bear]] poster]]

In August 1944, to reduce the number of [[wildfire|forest fires]],  the Forest Service and the [[Wartime Advertising Council]] began distributing fire education posters featuring a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The poster campaign was a success; the black bear would later be named "[[Smokey Bear]]", and would, for decades, be the "spokesbear" for the Forest Service.  Smokey Bear has appeared in innumerable TV commercials;  his popular catch phrase, "Only YOU can prevent forest fires", is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the United States. A recent study found that 95% of the people surveyed could complete the phrase when given the first few words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129032801/http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |title=The Story of Smokey Bear |publisher=United States Forest Service |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In September 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000, to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. The report is entitled "Managing the Impacts of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment: A Report to the President In Response to the Wildfires of 2000"—The National Fire Plan for short. The National Fire Plan continues to be an integral part of the Forest Service today. The following are important operational features of the National Fire Plan:
*Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy: The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and the subsequent 2001 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy act as the foundation of the National Fire Plan.
*Basic Premise of the National Fire Plan: Investing now in an optimal firefighting force, hazardous fuels reduction, and overall community protection will provide for immediate protection and future cost savings.
*Funding: Initially (2001), the National Fire Plan provided for an additional $1,100,994,000 for the Forest Service for a total wildland fire management budget of $1,910,193,000. In 2008, the total amount for the Forest Service in wildland fire management (not including emergency fire suppression funding) is $1,974,276,000.

In August 2014, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, announced that the agency will have to put $400 to $500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends. The decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken, but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freking|first1=Kevin|title=MONEY ALLOCATED FOR FIGHTING FIRES TO RUN OUT|url=http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/california/2014/08/05/money-allocated-fighting-fires-run/13636869/|work=Associated Press|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Bray Lassie 1967.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[Lassie]] with [[Robert Bray]] as U.S. Forest Ranger [[Corey Stuart]]]]
The U.S. Forest Service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s, as it became the setting for the long running classic TV show ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', with storylines focusing on Lassie's adventures with various forest rangers.&lt;ref name="jcs" /&gt;

The iconic collie's association with the Forest Service led to Lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the [[U.S. Senate]] and the Department of Agriculture, and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], which was dubbed by some as "The Lassie Program".&lt;ref name="jcs"&gt;{{cite web

== Controversies ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The history of the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests. These values and resources include [[grazing]], [[Lumber|timber]], [[mining]], [[recreation]], wildlife habitat, and [[wilderness]]. Because of continuing development elsewhere, the large size of National Forests have made them de facto wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species. In recent decades, the importance of mature forest for the [[spotted owl]] and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels.

In the 1990s, the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as [[airtanker]]s. (See [[U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal]].)

Another controversial issue is the policy on road building within the National Forests. In 1999, President Clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the National Forests to "assess their ecological, economic, and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=091000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;ttype=roadmain&amp;cid=FSE_003853&amp;position=RELATEDLINKS&amp;pname=Roadless-Home|work=Roadless Area Conservation|title=Home|publisher=US Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five and half years later, the Bush administration replaced this with a system where each state could petition the Forest Service to open forests in their territory to road building.

Some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A 2017 draft report describing the legal basis which provides federal land managers a scope of decision making authority exceeding that of state fish and game departments has proven unexpectedly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/forest-service-tried-to-quash-paper-debunking-montana-wildlife-authority/article_91ef1437-4df9-5ea0-8667-728e6f63ae91.html|title=Forest Service tried to quash paper debunking Montana wildlife authority|last=Chaney|first=Rob|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal adaptive strategy theory''' ('''UAST''') is an evolutionary theory developed by [[J. Philip Grime]] in collaboration with Simon Pierce describing the general limits to [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] based on the [[trade-off]] that organisms face when the resources they gain from the environment are allocated between either growth, maintenance or regeneration – known as the universal three-way trade-off.

==General theory==
A universal three-way [[trade-off]] produces [[Plant strategies|adaptive strategies]] throughout the tree of life, with extreme strategies facilitating the survival of genes via: C (competitive), the survival of the individual using traits that maximize resource acquisition and resource control in consistently productive [[Ecological niche|niches]]; S (stress-tolerant), individual survival via maintenance of metabolic performance in variable and unproductive niches; or R ([[ruderal]]), rapid gene propagation via rapid completion of the lifecycle and regeneration in niches where events are frequently lethal to the individual.

It is impossible for an organism to evolve a survival strategy in which all resources are devoted exclusively to one of these investment paths, but relatively extreme strategies exist, with a range of intermediates. The system can be represented by a triangle, with the three extreme possibilities at its vertices. The different species may be located at some particular point inside this triangle, accommodating a certain percentage of each of the three strategies.

It is possible to use multivariate statistics to determine the main trends in [[Phenotypic trait|phenotypic variability]] in a range of organisms, which for various major animal groups (most prominently [[vertebrate]]s), has been shown to have three main endpoints consistent with UAST.

UAST is a key part of the twin-filter model describing how species with similar overall strategies but divergent sets of minor traits [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in ecological communities.

==C-S-R Triangle theory==
C-S-R Triangle theory is the application of UAST to [[plant biology]]. The three strategies are competitor, stress tolerator, and ruderal. These strategies each thrive best in a unique combination of either high or low intensities of [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]].

===Competitors===
Competitors are plant species that thrive in areas of low intensity stress and disturbance and excel in [[Competition (biology)|biological competition]]. These species are able to outcompete other plants by most efficiently tapping into available resources. Competitors do this through a combination of favorable characteristics, including rapid growth rate, high productivity (growth in height, lateral spread, and root mass), and high capacity for [[phenotypic plasticity]]. This last feature allows competitors to be highly flexible in morphology and adjust the allocation of resources throughout the various parts of the plant as needed over the course of the growing season.

===Stress tolerators===
Stress tolerators are plant species that live in areas of high intensity stress and low intensity disturbance. Species that have adapted this strategy generally have slow growth rates, long-lived leaves, high rates of nutrient retention, and low phenotypic plasticity. Stress tolerators respond to environmental stresses through physiological variability. These species are often found in stressful environments such as alpine or arid habitats, deep shade, nutrient deficient soils, and areas of extreme pH levels.

===Ruderals===
[[Ruderal species|Ruderals]] are plant species that prosper in situations of high intensity disturbance and low intensity stress. These species are fast-growing and rapidly complete their life cycles, and generally produce large amounts of seeds. Plants that have adapted this strategy are often found colonizing recently disturbed land, and are often [[Annual plant|annuals]].

==Relation to the R* theory==
Understanding the differences between the CSR theory  and its major alternative the [[R* rule|R* theory]] has been a major goal in [[community ecology]] for many years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craine|first1=Joseph|title=Reconciling plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jabot|title=general modelling framework for resource-ratio and CSR theories of plant community dynamics|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the R* theory that predicts that competitive ability is determined by the ability to grow under low levels of resources, the CSR theory predicts that competitive ability is determined by [[relative growth rate]] and other size related traits. While some experiments supported the R* predictions, other supported the CSR predictions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The different predictions stem from different assumptions on the [[size-asymmetric competition|size asymmetry of the competition]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size symmetric (i.e. resource exploitation is proportional to individual biomass), the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric (i.e. large individuals exploit disproportional higher amounts of resources compared with smaller individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMalach|title=Size asymmetry of resource competition and the structure of plant communities|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vorarephilia''' (often shortened to '''vore''') is a [[paraphilia]] characterized by the erotic desire to be consumed by, or sometimes to personally consume, another person or creature, or an erotic attraction to the process of eating in general practice.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="straightDope"&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams |first= Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | date = 2004-07-02 | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040702.html | title=Eat or be eaten: Is cannibalism a pathology as listed in the DSM-IV? | publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] | accessdate=2007-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Functional and dysfunctional sexual behavior: a synthesis of neuroscience and comparative psychology | first=Anders | last=Ågmo | publisher=Academic Press | year=2007 | isbn=0-12-370590-8 | page=454 | doi=10.1016/B978-012370590-7/50013-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brundage2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Brundage |first= Sandy |journal= The Wave Magazine| volume= 2 |issue= 15 |title= Fetish Confessions |date= 2002-07-31 | url= http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?articleid=22026&amp;pagename=article |accessdate= 2007-04-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927061721/http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?articleid=22026&amp;pagename=article &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since vorarephilic fantasies cannot usually be acted out in reality, they are often expressed in stories or drawings shared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Lykins"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lykins|first1=Amy D.|last2=Cantor|first2=James M.|title=Vorarephilia: A Case Study in Masochism and Erotic Consumption|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=21 September 2013|volume=43|issue=1|pages=181–186|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0185-y|pmid=24057211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vorarephilia'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vorare'' (to "[[Swallowing|swallow]]" or "devour"), and [[Ancient Greek]] φιλία (''philía'', "[[love]]").

The fantasy usually involves the victim being swallowed whole, though occasionally the victims are chewed up, and digestion may or may not be included.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brundage2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt; Vore fantasies are separated from sexual [[cannibalism]] because the living victim is normally swallowed whole.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; Sometimes the consumers are human, but [[Anthropomorphism|anthropormorphized animals]], normal animals, dragons, and enormous snakes also appear frequently in these fantasies.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; After consumption, the enlarged belly of the consumer is often described with great care.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; Vorarephiles sometimes prefer to differentiate between ''soft vore'' and ''hard vore''; soft vore means the victim is swallowed whole and alive, and may possibly come back out in the case of a "non-fatal" scenario, while in hard vore the victim goes through a more gruesome, realistic digestion process, often getting chewed up beforehand.

Vore is most often enjoyed through pictures, stories, videos, and [[video games]], and it can appear in mainstream media.&lt;ref name=brathwaite&gt;{{cite book | title=Sex in video games | series=Advances in computer graphics and game development | first=Brenda | last=Brathwaite | place=London | publisher=Charles River Media | year=2007 | isbn=1-58450-459-5 | page=20 | url=http://www.charlesriver.com/resrcs/chapters/1584504595_1stChap.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180711/http://www.charlesriver.com/resrcs/chapters/1584504595_1stChap.pdf | chapter = Defining sex | archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, vorarephilia may be described as a variation of [[macrophilia]] and may combine with other paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Weirdly Beloved: Tales of Strange Bedfellows, Odd Couplings, and Love Gone Bad | first=Cynthia | last=Ceilán | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2008 | isbn=1-59921-403-2 | page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from macrophilia, vore fantasies often have themes of [[BDSM]], [[microphilia]], [[pregnancy fetishism]], [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry fetishism]], "unbirthing" (a desire to be swallowed whole into the vagina and returned to the uterus), and sexual cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;

One [[case study]] analysis connected the fantasy with [[sexual masochism]], and suggested that it could be motivated by a desire to merge with a powerful other or permanently escape loneliness.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; With "no known treatment" for vorarephiles who feel ill at ease with their sexuality, psychologists at Toronto's [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] have recommended trying to "adjust to, rather than change or suppress" the sexual interest.&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite news | author = Brean, Joseph | date = 1 October 2013 | url = http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/10/01/man-who-desired-to-be-eaten-by-a-large-dominant-woman-a-baffling-case-for-toronto-psychiatric-hospital-doctors/ | title = Man who desired to be eaten by a 'large, dominant woman' a baffling case for Toronto psychiatric hospital doctors | work = National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medication for libido reduction could be used if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

In 1876 the ''Rijkslandbouwschool'' (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the ''Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool'' (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in ''Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool'' (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).

In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to ''Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool'' (National Agricultural College). The openings date and official [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|Dies natalis]] is 9 March 1918.

In 1986 the "hogescholen" (comparable to scientific [[institute of technology]]) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became ''Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW)'' (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name [[Hogeschool#Netherlands|hogeschool]] in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science.

Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general; while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new holding was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under the Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.

In 2006, the university of applied sciences [[Van Hall Larenstein]] became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures for the different types of higher education, collaboration between the two schools remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]].

In 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication. In addition university research could be presented under the name of the university: ''Wageningen University (WU)'' (as an alternative of using the name of the holding Wageningen UR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wageningen Universiteit (WU)|url=http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_%28WU%29|publisher=Studie.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013|language=Dutch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107041532/http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_(WU)|archive-date=2012-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Wageningen UR|url=http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/About-Wageningen-UR/History-of-Wageningen-UR.htm|publisher=Wageningenur.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes decided to continue as one, jointly brand: ''Wageningen University &amp; Research'' (''WUR''). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University &amp; Research celebrates her 100 years anniversary. During this year there are many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. 

==Academic profile==
Wageningen University &amp; Research was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the [[European Commission]] and guarantees the quality of the study programme. An important consideration is that the university consequently applies the European Credit Transfer System; this promotes the mobility of students within Europe and prevents study delay. The label is an acknowledgement of the international character of the university. Out of 56 European applications in 2005, only three ECTS labels were awarded.
